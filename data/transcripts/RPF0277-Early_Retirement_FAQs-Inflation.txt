[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.680]   Do you have some money in your bank account?
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.680]   Good.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680]   That's a good place to start.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.120]   If not, don't worry about today's show.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.640]   Just skip to a different show.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.760]   But if you do have money in your bank account or some type of account, are you aware that
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.400]   just about every day that money is losing value?
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.520]   It's becoming worth systematically less and less.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.920]   This we like to call inflation and it's a careful design of our currency.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.920]   In fact, the controllers of our currency supply, the Federal Reserve Board, there's a lot of
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.480]   hand wringing in Washington right now.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.160]   They can't create as much inflation as they've been working to create.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.280]   But inflation calls for a defensive plan.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.680]   Today we're going to talk about how do you protect your wealth from the effects of inflation
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.800]   in retirement.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.040]   And more importantly, if you are an early retiree, how do you protect your wealth from
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:51.840]   the effects of inflation over a very long period of time?
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.720]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.240]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.560]   Today we talk inflation with a man named a rebel spy or Arabelspi.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.680]   Well, that's actually not his name.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.360]   His name is Joe and he's an awesome guy.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.620]   And even if you don't care about inflation, make sure you stay listening to this interview
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.800]   to hear how a couple of teachers gained financial independence on a teacher's salary by the
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.480]   age of 30.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.960]   Perhaps for some of you, that might be even more interesting than the inflation conversation.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.200]   I was able to coax a little bit of information out of Joe about his story.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400]   He didn't want to talk about it too much but I coaxed just a little bit out of him
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.160]   about how he and his wife, starting with nothing, both of them working as government school
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.480]   teachers have been able to save their way to financial independence by the time that
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   they were 30 years old.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   You're going to hear a little bit of that story.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.740]   Joe has been on the show a couple of times previously.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.820]   He is well-known online under the username A Rebel Spy or if you did what I did and many
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.820]   others do, Arabelspi.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.280]   That's how I thought of him as years.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   But you've seen him.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.640]   He is a moderator in the popular Mr. Money Mustache online forums and you'll see his
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.700]   screen name splashed across the internet in the personal finance space.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.480]   But one of the things that I have enjoyed with conversations with Joe is Joe is not
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   promoting anything.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.520]   He doesn't even have a website.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.440]   He's not particularly trying to get anybody to do anything.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.320]   He's just one of those quiet guys who's sitting around working on his own plan, systematically
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.260]   building his financial independence and building it for himself and his family, studying his
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.260]   way through.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.840]   He's very knowledgeable about various aspects of finance as you may have heard if you've
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.120]   heard previous episodes with him.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.540]   He's just a normal guy who's a knowledgeable guy and his extensive involvement in online
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.440]   forums has led to his facing just about all the different questions that relate to finance.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.820]   That's why I brought him on for this FAQ series of what are the most frequently asked questions
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.820]   of early retirement.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.840]   Today, we talk about inflation.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.760]   How do you protect your wealth against the damaging effects of inflation?
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.360]   This is of special interest to Joe because he's 30 years old and he and his wife have
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.400]   quit their jobs and they are currently traveling around the world expecting never to return
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.320]   to the world of paid employment again unless they choose that that's something that they
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.680]   want to do.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.800]   Well, inflation is a little different if you're 30 years old versus if you're 70 years old.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.120]   It takes a little bit of a different plan and you're going to hear that during the course
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.560]   of today's interview.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   This interview is not a carefully scripted put together presentation where he or I are
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.680]   trying to convince you to do something.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.920]   This is more like the kind of conversation you might hear if Joe and I had been sitting
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.240]   down in person sharing a cold drink some evening somewhere together and we were sitting around
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.920]   the table talking about financial topics.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.520]   That's more the ebb and flow of this conversation.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.320]   So if you enjoy that type of interaction, you'll enjoy today's interview.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.960]   Before I play the interview though, I'd like to just thank our sponsors for today.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.600]   Sponsor of the day number one is SoFi, the social finance corporation who specialize
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.720]   in helping you refinance your student loans.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.000]   One of the things that we always want to be working for is minimizing cost in all area
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.040]   of our life.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.180]   One very important way to do that is to minimize cost on interest rates.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.240]   If you have debt in your life, all things being equal, the lower you can get the interest
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.080]   rates, the better because you'll save money and there'll be less money out of your pocket.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.920]   Now, don't think for an instant that lowering interest rates is somehow going to magically
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.040]   save you from a debt situation.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   It's not.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.680]   If you're working on paying off a debt or if you've chosen to deploy your money into
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.200]   other investments that are growing at a rate of interest higher than your debt, then go
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.660]   ahead and try to lower your debt costs as much as possible.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.200]   One way that you can do that is to refinance your student loans.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.680]   SoFi specializes in student loan refinance.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.860]   They have rates that are substantially lower than most other sources.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.960]   If you'd like the information on that, please go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/SoFi.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.160]   They have a very quick, very simple online application process where they'll give you
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.980]   a very quick answer letting you know if you qualify for refinance with their terms and
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.820]   if so, what the rates will be.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.780]   If you use my tracking link, you will get a $200 bonus credited to you, $200 bonus for
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.400]   using my special tracking link.

[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.200]   It's a great modern process and see if you can save some money on your student loans.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.360]   Sponsor of the day number two today is Patrick Snow.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.760]   Patrick is my personal publishing coach.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.000]   As we begin the year in 2016, if you've ever thought about writing a book, why don't you
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.600]   follow through and actually make it happen?
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.120]   It's a New Year's resolution for many people and what happens is we often try to do things
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.440]   over and over and over by ourselves.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.760]   Well, I don't know about you, but personally I believe in hiring the best advisors and
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.080]   consultants that I can find and that was the process with my hiring Patrick Snow to work
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.920]   with me as my publishing coach.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.360]   Patrick has helped me lay out a plan for the book.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.560]   He's helped me with some of his templates.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.680]   I'm not using some of his templates because I've already had some other ideas, but he
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.080]   sent me his templates and things that would help me just create the book even if I wasn't
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.600]   sure of all the ideas to actually create and publish a book.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   It's probably one of the best marketing tools that you could have for your personal brand,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.040]   for your personal business, etc.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.320]   So connect with Patrick.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.040]   Find out more information on him at thepublishingdoctor.com.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.080]   You can find some interviews with him and some details on all of his different packages
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   and services.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.880]   If you're remotely interested, reach out to him for a complimentary consultation.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.360]   He'll give you a 30 to 60-minute complimentary consultation, give you some nuggets of advice
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.400]   on what you should do, whether or not you choose to hire him, that's up to you.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.200]   But check out his information at thepublishingdoctor.com.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.960]   Let him know I sent you.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.440]   Right now, sit back, relax, and enjoy the interview with Joe.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   Joe, welcome back to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.280]   Joe F. Luskowitz, CFO Alphabet and Google
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.880]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.680]   Glad to be back.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.080]   Always enjoy chatting with you.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.480]   I was looking through the archives and the last time you were on the show was episode
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.040]   95.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.560]   So I'm not sure if it's about a year or almost a year, but it's been quite a while.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.120]   I'm excited to have you back on to talk about some of these early retirement frequently
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.280]   asked questions.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.400]   But before we get into the question of the day, which is we're going to focus primarily
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.120]   on how to handle inflation in your retirement planning, a few things have changed since
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.320]   the last time we talked.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   Where are you right now in the world?
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.640]   Right now, I am in Zagreb, Croatia, staying in an apartment we have rented on Airbnb for
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.440]   a couple of weeks.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:51.920]   Since last year, my wife and I actually decided to pull the plug on working and we quit our
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:02.000]   jobs in June, both teachers, and now we are kind of full traveling the world and checking
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.160]   out some places, seeing what there is to see.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.080]   So she turned, let's see, 67 and you just turned 68, right?
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.440]   To be able to retire as a teacher.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.440]   Right.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.320]   And I actually retired right before my 30th birthday.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.640]   So now I'm 30, but I managed to squeak it in right at 29, about a week before I turned
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   30.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.640]   And then my wife's a year younger.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   She's 29 right now.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   No.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.000]   So then obviously, your dad died and left you a couple million bucks and you used that
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.440]   to retire on it.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.840]   That's obviously what happened, right?
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   No.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.840]   Thankfully, both of my parents are still in great health.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.020]   We didn't get any inheritances or win any lotteries.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:53.600]   We had a lot of fortunate things happen in terms of we were both raised in loving households
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.720]   that taught us the importance of education and learning, reading.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:09.840]   And then we just were very frugal and invested a lot and put in extra effort and yeah, managed
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.600]   to pull it off.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.520]   So I know obviously I'm being a little bit tongue in cheek here with my questions, but
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.440]   it is a remarkable story.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.640]   It's not a common, even though it seems like there have been a couple people on the show
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.680]   in past episodes who are teachers who've built their way to financial independence.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.480]   It's not a common idea that people say, "I'm going to go into the profession of teaching
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.260]   and use that to get rich so I can retire early."
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:42.800]   At what point in time did you guys get hold of this idea of early retirement?
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.600]   That's a good question.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.760]   It was probably right around when we started working.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:11:00.600]   We graduated college in 2007 and right as stuff was peaking, right before the recession.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.880]   I wasn't planning on becoming a teacher.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.440]   It was something I signed up for two years for with Teach for America to try and help
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.880]   close the achievement gap in lower income communities and just fell in love with teaching.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.800]   Just enjoyed so much going to school every day and working with these kids.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:34.080]   But I knew that doing that wasn't necessarily something I wanted to do my entire life.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.120]   I think right around that time, we had already been reading personal finance blogs like Get
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.880]   Rich Slowly back in 2006.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.600]   I think we first stumbled on that and then Jacob Lundfisker's Early Retirement Extreme
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.680]   in 2007.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:56.000]   All along had some of these influences and just started investing and saving and buying
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.400]   rental properties and slowly and steadily making our way towards that.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.680]   So, it is exciting and congratulations.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.840]   You're in Croatia now and where have you been so far and where are you heading and
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.400]   then we'll get to the meat of our conversation today.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:23.000]   We started off doing a religious pilgrimage called El Camino de Santiago in Spain.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.640]   It's about a 500-mile walk across northern Spain and there's all these different routes
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.880]   to get to the city of Santiago.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:38.280]   But it's this pilgrimage that's been going on for over a thousand years that people will
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:44.720]   walk this and at the end, you get this certificate of completion, a compostela from the Catholic
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   Church.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.540]   Neither of us are particularly religious but it's kind of people of all walks of life
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:57.040]   do it nowadays for whatever spiritual or physical or whatever reasons they have.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:04.640]   It took us 35 days to walk and we were not prepared.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.440]   It was a lot harder than we thought it would be.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.040]   We read some books about it and there's a movie called The Way with Martin Sheen that
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:20.640]   came out in 2010 about this walk and most of them kind of, they don't mention how difficult
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.040]   it might be.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.520]   I think it has a survivorship bias in that all the people who go there and walk for three
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.120]   days and then stop walking and quit, they don't tell their stories.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.600]   Anyone who's completed it and writes a book about it obviously enjoyed it.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.140]   But anyway, so we did that.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:48.120]   We walked across northern Spain for 500 miles for a little over a month and then we went
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:54.600]   to Portugal for about 10 days and then we went to Germany for about two weeks and then
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.720]   we went up to London for about a week and down to Marrakesh, Morocco for about two weeks
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.680]   and now we've been over in Croatia for Split and now Zagreb.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.880]   And then we're going over to Istanbul.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.320]   My wife is currently pregnant and due January 31st.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.320]   - Congratulations, dude.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   I didn't know that.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   Congrats.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   - Thank you.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.200]   So that was kind of our plan all along was to retire and then start raising kids so that
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.000]   we can be full-time parents.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.480]   So we're going to be having the baby in Istanbul.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.880]   We're going there in a week or two and we'll be settling down there for three months, having
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.920]   the kid and then move on from there.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   - That's exciting.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   Awesome.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.520]   So let's get to the major question that we're here to talk about today.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.040]   It's been a while and you're a friend of the show and I wanted to have that personal update
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.840]   because I think it's really inspiring.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.560]   I definitely – we're the same age.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.560]   I don't know.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.960]   Maybe I'm a year ahead of you or half a year ahead of you but I sometimes wish back.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.680]   I wish in 2007 when I graduated from college, I wish I had found Early Retirement Extreme
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.400]   then instead of, I don't know, 2012 or something like that when I finally found it.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.120]   I would be in your position.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.560]   But unfortunately, I have some money in IRAs and Roth IRAs and I had some good times because
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.920]   I saved my 10 or 15 percent, Joe.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.520]   - You were ahead of most people.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.560]   - I was ahead of most people but I feel like I got sold the short end of the stick by the
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.920]   financial planning profession because I did what they said and I'm 30 and I'm not rich.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.480]   I'm rich in many things and richer than most but still have a long way to go toward financial
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.480]   independence.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.120]   So let's talk about inflation.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:43.000]   Inflation is one of those words that brings fear into the heart of most traditional retirees
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.800]   and it's one of those things that as a financial advisor, we spend a lot of time talking to
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.960]   people about how to protect themselves from inflation, how to plan for it.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.920]   You are basically screwed because you're 30 and you got 70 years to live off of this nest
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.480]   egg.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.200]   Do you wake up with cold sweats in the middle of the night thinking about and worrying about
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.880]   the inflation of the currency and the fact that you're going to be broke in the future?
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   - Not exactly.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.040]   I do worry about it.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.680]   I think that inflation is the number one enemy of the early retiree.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:22.840]   I think because like you said, I've got decades and decades for the purchasing power of my
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.120]   money to just erode.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.720]   So while I'm not worried about it, I definitely think it's something that is important to
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.120]   talk about and plan for.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.680]   - How do you-- well, let's start with talking about what is inflation.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.840]   What are the major aspects of inflation that you consider and how they're going to affect
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   your life?
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:50.320]   - Okay, so inflation just in general is just the idea that things get more expensive over
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:17:00.140]   time and prices tend to increase and the value of your money goes down.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:06.240]   We see this example whenever we look at anything from more than a few decades ago, something
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:13.000]   from the '50s where someone goes in to get a soda bottle for five cents or you look at
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.400]   the median house price and it was $5,000.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.600]   My wife and I were watching It's a Wonderful Life yesterday because now it's Christmas
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.040]   time we can watch all those fun movies and George Bailey in there goes, "You know how
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.160]   long it takes a working man to save up $5,000?"
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.560]   because he's talking to Mr. Potter.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.760]   Right now, I think the poverty line is somewhere around $20,000, four times that.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:40.480]   So you look at examples like this and you see that money buys less things over time
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.840]   and there's a number of reasons why but that's just generally the idea of what inflation
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   is.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:52.160]   So if you are an early retiree and you go, "Okay, I want to buy things," but they get
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.640]   more expensive over time, obviously you're not working anymore, your salary is not going
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.000]   to increase, so you're going to have to do other things to make up for that, to make
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.920]   sure that your purchasing power doesn't erode via growing your portfolio in your retirement.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.940]   What kind of things?
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.600]   So there's a few different ways to protect yourself.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.760]   In a word, or I guess in two words, asset allocation.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:30.960]   Looking at what sort of things am I invested in and how can I make sure those things themselves
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.520]   keep up with inflation.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:41.180]   So specifically, there's types of investments called TIPs, they're Treasury Inflation Protected
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:46.980]   Securities and IBONs and those are both very similar things.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.840]   We probably don't need to go into the differences then, but they're basically like a savings
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.280]   bond from the government that adjusts with inflation.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.520]   So you get paid out every six months, twice a year you get paid interest on it and that
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:11.700]   interest increases with inflation, it's pegged to an inflation index and as inflation happens
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.460]   and the price of goods rises, your interest payment rises and also the principle of that
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.600]   bond itself rises.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:29.400]   So it's not worth any more at the end unless you're getting a rate plus inflation, but
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.160]   it holds its value if that makes sense.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.160]   But you're not trying to live off of the income, a 30-year-old early retiree, you're not trying
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.080]   to live off the income from a TIPs portfolio, are you?
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.360]   No, I'm not personally.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:46.800]   That's one asset I think should be in, if you're making a balanced portfolio, that's
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.360]   one asset I think every early retiree should consider.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:58.480]   I don't think, I think if you saved up and put your whole nest egg into TIPs, that's
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.400]   certainly one way to handle deflation.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:08.160]   I think you open yourself up to other potential problems like deflation.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.520]   You might be kind of overprotecting yourself and then the other downside is they don't
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.720]   have a lot of growth potential, meaning you're probably going to have to work a lot longer
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:25.880]   and build a lot larger nest egg to be able to survive on the returns from those TIPs.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.480]   So how are you planning for inflation?
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.300]   So me personally, we have a number of rental properties.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:38.240]   So real estate is another great inflation hedge simply because the value of the land
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.600]   will tend to go up with inflation as well as the actual whatever improvements are on
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:49.680]   the land because like I mentioned earlier, that $5,000 house may be $100,000, $200,000
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:58.080]   now because the goods themselves, the materials, the wood, the nails, the shingles, whatever
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.520]   the house is built of goes up with inflation.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:07.640]   So any new person wanting to buy a house, say a young couple buying a new house, if
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:13.280]   a new house had to be built for them, then all those goods that are used to build it
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.720]   would cost more to buy and all the labor of the people building it, also their wages have
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.320]   gone up over time so their labor costs more.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.860]   So the house itself costs a lot more to build.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.100]   So then your house that's older, it may not sell for the same as a new house, but it's
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.560]   still going to rise as those new home prices rise.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.760]   So the underlying value of that hard asset rises with inflation and then also any income
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.760]   it produces.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:46.120]   Our rents, we can increase the rents on our tenants as sort of wages rise.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:54.960]   So if our tenants get a raise at work, a cost of living raise because of inflation, then
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.720]   we can raise their rents and now we just got a cost of living raise.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.840]   Mad Fientist I think real estate is definitely really
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.520]   powerful for this and the reason is real estate is always going to be – the value of real
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.320]   estate is always going to be tied to the actual value in the local economy, which is going
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.960]   to be driven by the local jobs, the local wages, the local things to buy and sell.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.480]   It's all going to be driven by what's actually happening in the economy.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.640]   If you're living on the rental income from a portfolio – excuse me, if you're living
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.800]   off of the income from a rental portfolio, then that rental income, it may grow or it
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.240]   may shrink as you have to adjust rents to stay in line with the local markets.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.080]   But the value of that house, because it's a tangible good that's providing a commodity,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.400]   a place to live, the value of that house is going to stay consistent with whatever the
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.440]   local market is doing.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.880]   So if you buy right, at the very least, your income can adjust and fluctuate as you adjust
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.280]   your rents, assuming your houses are in good shape and all that.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.320]   Your income can adjust with the local economic environment.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:04.600]   Now if you are investing in a rental portfolio in Detroit, that might mean over time your
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.720]   standard of living is going to decrease because the local economy has fallen apart.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.500]   Or if you are doing it in San Francisco, it might have increased over the last number
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.880]   of years as the economy has improved.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.560]   But it's directly tied to the local economy, which is where you're going to be buying
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.040]   and selling, which is where you're going to be living and doing business.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.280]   So it is a powerful inflation hedge.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   Absolutely.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   Absolutely.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:35.320]   Another popular one, real estate itself, specifically rental real estate, a lot of retirees kind
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.680]   of shy away from because they don't want to work.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.000]   That's why they retired.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.360]   And it can be seen as a lot of work.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.760]   I don't necessarily agree with that as I haven't been in the same country as my rental properties
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:53.160]   for the last five months and everything's running along just fine.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.120]   How have you set that up to be able to do that?
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.720]   So I have a number of properties in a few different states and the ones outside of where
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.920]   I was living, I already had a property manager.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.840]   So they take care of everything and email me updates.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.960]   And then my local properties, I was managing myself.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:22.120]   I have a number of property managers I know in town that I can turn the properties over
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.080]   to when necessary.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.600]   Right now I'm still managing them from afar because my management, I don't ever do any
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.600]   work on the properties.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.160]   I always hire people.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.360]   So I have a number of handymen and different companies that I've worked with, electricians
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.120]   and plumbing companies and things like that, AC.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.720]   And so if there's a problem, the tenants text me, "Oh, hey, the AC is not working."
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.400]   And then I text my handyman and say, "Hey, can you go over to this property?
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.000]   Here's the tenant's phone number."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.800]   And it takes me about two minutes in a text message to handle any of those sort of issues.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:02.780]   So that won't work necessarily while there's turnover when the tenants move out.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.360]   So that's why I'm going to kind of turn the properties over one by one as a tenant moves
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.800]   out, hand it over to a property manager and they can get it fixed up, re-rented and take
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   over at that point.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   That's great.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.720]   And also you get to benefit from earning your money in the United States and spending your
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.280]   money in Eastern Europe where hopefully there's a good geo-arbitrage opportunity for the value
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.040]   of your dollars.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.360]   That's definitely an advantage potentially at the moment.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.400]   I kind of view that as I don't know what it's going to do in the future.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:44.480]   I can't necessarily predict that other dollars will rise or fall faster than the U.S. dollar,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.360]   so I'm not counting on being able to continue to do stuff cheap overseas.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:56.760]   But for now, there are definitely some really nice places.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.300]   One place that's been on our list for a while is Chiang Mai, Thailand, and it seems like
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.800]   everybody loves it and it's cheap.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.200]   So yeah, that's definitely one thing we're excited about getting to take advantage of
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   for now.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:16.320]   Let's talk about personalized rates of inflation versus general economy-wide rates of inflation.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.480]   First, talk about how the rate of inflation is calculated in the general economy and then
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   how you would look at your own life and calculate your own rate of inflation.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.820]   Okay.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:33.960]   So the way it's generally calculated for the economy is using something called the CPI,
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.260]   the Consumer Price Index, where the government has what they call a basket of goods.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.440]   Basically they have, if you just picture a list of different items and it has on it different
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.160]   food like it might have chicken and apples and a pound of apples and it has stuff like
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.500]   gasoline and clothes and cars.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.220]   So it's got all these different items that people buy and it's kind of a monthly running
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.300]   update of here's what it would cost to buy these things.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.060]   And then the next month they check in with all these different markets and see and go,
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.980]   "Okay, here's what it costs now and here's what it costs now."
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.860]   And slowly over time you see, "Okay, those prices on these things are rising."
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.180]   Well, that's then what we'll call the inflation rate.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:20.860]   The percent that those goods rose in that Consumer Price Index, that's how much inflation
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.700]   is.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:33.620]   And one of the biggest kind of myths or maybe misnomers I see in early retirement communities
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.900]   and I've seen over the last decade when people go and post online and talk about inflation
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:46.740]   is they think that they can try and beat inflation by doing certain things.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:51.020]   They want to keep their own personal inflation rate lower and say, "Well, the CPI is maybe
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.220]   3% but I think I can experience less inflation."
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.420]   And they try and argue for why they may not see that much inflation.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.940]   So let me put forward an argument and I'd love to hear your thoughts on why I don't
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.940]   think that's the case.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.580]   - Okay, go ahead.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.860]   - So generally what people say is, "Well, my inflation rate's going to be lower because
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.340]   I don't buy cars.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.180]   I have a bicycle and I don't buy gasoline."
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:22.540]   And so they say, "Well, all those items on the Consumer Price Index, I don't buy a bunch
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.780]   of those so I'm not going to experience that same inflation."
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.940]   And that's generally their argument.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:35.980]   But the reason why I don't buy that is because even if you don't buy those particular items,
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:42.740]   whatever items you do buy should still increase via the rate of inflation, right?
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:47.620]   - Yeah, so I think this argument has pros and cons.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.700]   And what can happen is somebody could be a little bit too starry-eyed, somebody who's
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.700]   new to the world of early retirement and says, "Well, I'm just going to live like Jacob Blundfisker
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.700]   lives and he's my guru."
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.540]   We love you, Jacob, but sorry you have to be the guru.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.300]   But I'm going to live like Jacob lives and I'm just not going to buy anything.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.300]   I'm going to do it all myself.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.740]   I'm going to fix my own bike.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.900]   I'm going to go out and just find these things everywhere.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.460]   And I think that certainly somebody like Jacob or somebody like you who's resourceful and
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:25.500]   who's able to demonstrate just their ability to find ways to accomplish things that don't
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.300]   just involve plopping down your credit card for retail prices, there's always going to
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.820]   be a way to control for prices.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:38.140]   - I actually disagree with that.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:46.180]   So I think it's irrelevant how handy you are and how much you're fixing yourself because
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.460]   theoretically you should already be calculating that in your spending to start out with.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:57.820]   So let's say, for example, you do live, you homestead and you've got this farm and you
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:02.180]   raise most of your own food and you repair everything yourself and you've got your expenses
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.660]   down to $5,000 annually.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:12.540]   And that's a couple thousand bucks for property taxes and health insurance and I don't know,
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.540]   and then some staples that you can't buy, some stuff that you just can't make yourself
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.260]   that you do have to buy.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.700]   So your bike breaks and you repair it free.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.700]   Great.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.540]   You never had in your original $5,000 any budget to actually repair it.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:33.780]   But let's say you did have, I don't know, a bike tube in there in that $5,000.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.020]   Well, that is still going to inflate with inflation.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.780]   I mean, whatever you were calculating in that $5,000, even if you're like, I'll fix everything
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.780]   myself.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.900]   So my cost is zero.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.500]   Okay.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.660]   So your costs of, let's say you're living a $20,000 lifestyle or $40,000 lifestyle and
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.220]   it's only costing you 5,000 because you insource everything yourself.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.860]   But whatever was of that 5,000, you still need to worry about inflation.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:05.300]   So if you have income coming in that covers that 5,000, it still needs to be protected
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   from inflation.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.360]   So I'll buy that argument, but I'll just say that the difference comes in where the discussion
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.500]   comes in is when we're talking about it within the context of people who are knowledgeable
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.300]   and interested in early retirement, who are living a frugal lifestyle, who are taking
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.080]   control over their expenses.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.780]   Your argument is correct.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:30.620]   When comparing an early retirement lifestyle to a generalized, I'll just say mainstream
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.140]   lifestyle, that's where the difference comes in.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:40.100]   Because so example, housing, what are the inflation costs that are associated with housing?
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.180]   Well, once you purchase a property to live in, if you have a fixed rate mortgage and
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:50.460]   a fixed, excuse me, and a fixed mortgage payment, you have a fixed rate mortgage and a fixed
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.660]   mortgage payment, that mortgage payment is not going to be affected by the inflation
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.100]   rate unless you sell it, but your property taxes are.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.700]   So once you start to get in a little bit of control of setting up your lifestyle, you
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.700]   can control the inflation rate and you can transition some of the things that are going
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:12.380]   to be affected by inflation to things that aren't.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:18.580]   And so the way I think about it is I think how can I go through and look at every place
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.380]   that you connect with the mainstream economy, there's going to be an inflation rate associated
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.140]   with that because costs are continually going up, the currency is continually debasing,
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.500]   that is the way that our monetary system is structured.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:36.020]   Until it's reset and adjusted at some point in coming decades, then it's going to continue
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.160]   to be the same.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:46.860]   But you can decouple from the mainstream markets in some aspects of your life and as long as
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.380]   you stay decoupled from them.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:54.020]   So for example, your inflation risk is frozen on your house until you've got to go and buy
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.300]   another one.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.260]   And then once you get back into that market, that's where you start to experience the effects
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.260]   again.
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.340]   I agree with you on the mortgage.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:11.580]   And that's actually one of the best inflation hedges you can have is a fixed rate mortgage.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:18.780]   And I think for that reason, every early retiree should have a long-term low fixed mortgage.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.260]   And I know that's going to sound crazy to a lot of people because they want the paid
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.700]   off house and the security that comes with it.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:32.900]   But I think you're risking a lot more inflation when you don't have that mortgage.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.380]   That basically if you instead had that money invested in something that's protected against
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.420]   inflation, yes, your budget would be higher, but that part of the budget wouldn't be rising
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.420]   with inflation.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:48.300]   Yeah, and just to give an example and then you can continue, I would rather have—living
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.700]   in a $200,000 house, I'd rather have as close to a $200,000 fixed rate mortgage on my house
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:59.460]   that I can have and then have a paid off rental property and have the rental income from the
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.460]   paid off rental property.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.020]   Because the rental income from the rental property I can adjust with the local prevailing
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:08.980]   inflation rate, but then I can take advantage of the fixed rate mortgage on my personal
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980]   house.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.980]   Would you agree?
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   And feel free to continue your point.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:18.580]   Yes, but I would say go ahead and have a fixed rate mortgage on that rental property.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.940]   Right.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:27.700]   But in theory, I think the mortgage is the only example I can think of off the top of
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:33.700]   my head that is like that because you're essentially borrowing against the dollar.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:40.340]   It's at a fixed rate, so any sort of inflation won't affect you.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.220]   It won't affect that payment.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.700]   But if we presume a paid off house to make it easier, I think every other expense that
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:56.300]   you have is going to rise with inflation, whether that's property taxes, health care,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.220]   home insurance, and whatever, food, whatever.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.040]   All of those things are going to rise.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:06.820]   So people's arguments of, "Well, I won't buy XYZ thing.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.140]   I don't buy a car."
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.820]   Okay, but you didn't have that in your budget to begin with, so that doesn't affect the
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.580]   inflation rate on all the other items.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.580]   Right.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:20.020]   So I come back to it's basically the only way to escape inflation is if you can decouple
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.780]   from the market.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.820]   So that's where you could escape some of the effects of inflation if you go ahead and purchase
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.540]   the solar panels that you'll need for your roof to generate your electricity.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.220]   You go ahead and set up your water catchment system so you don't have to buy water from
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.220]   the grid, et cetera.
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.780]   Well, now you're decoupling and you can freeze the costs.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.180]   And so as the general economy is getting more expensive, costs are rising, the local utility
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.060]   company is supporting all of their pensions, you don't have to deal with that because you've
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.340]   just said, "Okay, $20,000 here.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.220]   I'm buying these panels," or whatever the equivalent is in your area, and now you've
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.540]   frozen that cost.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:03.380]   But your point is that the budget that you're living prior to retirement is going to be
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:08.220]   the same as the budget you're living after retirement, and that budget is being affected
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.220]   by inflation.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.220]   Right.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:16.420]   So if you say, "Okay, I got my solar panels and now I put in my electricity cost is zero
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:21.260]   because the solar panels generate everything I need," then that's not a line item in
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.140]   my budget anymore, but whatever items are in my budget are still going to increase and
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.620]   you still have to think about inflation.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.780]   So when people talk about like, "Okay," or let's take another example.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.220]   Let's say you stockpiled food.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.100]   Let's say they say, "I'm worried about the price of food, so I'm going to stockpile all
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.420]   these canned goods."
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:44.340]   Okay, you've then protected yourself from inflation on the price of those foods, but
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:52.420]   what I would argue is you're doing it suboptimally by—what you're doing is you're losing out
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.060]   on the opportunity cost of that money that you purchased it with.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:02.220]   And so if you stockpile food, you're basically presuming food is going to inflate faster
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.860]   than whatever investment I would put that money into.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.500]   That's the only way you would come out ahead.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.340]   So I would actually hold to this perspective, and here's why.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.500]   So far, we've been talking about a normal inflation rate.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.500]   So normal inflation rate, usually we plan on say 3 or 4 percent.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.200]   But there have been periods in history in which economies go through abnormal periods
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.400]   of inflation.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:34.620]   So you can go through a period of deflation, extremely unlikely in the U.S. economy, but
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.340]   you could, in theory, go through a period of deflation.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:43.300]   You could go through mass inflation, the term that I use, 10, 15, 20 percent per year for
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.780]   a period of years.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.180]   And in theory, you could get to the point of hyperinflation, where you get dozens of
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.940]   percent or in excess of 100 percent of annual inflation.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.540]   It's happened in some places in the world.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:59.980]   I think it's very unlikely to happen in the United States, but it's in theory at least
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   possible.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:06.660]   I look at a period, and what I expect as a possibility and perhaps even a probability
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:12.500]   is that at some point in time, we'll go through periods of short-term mass inflation.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:18.540]   So back to the idea of what happened in the '70s, or where you're talking about inflation
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.340]   10, 15, 20 percent per year for a couple of years as you deal with recession and deal
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.500]   with working your way through the economic cycles.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.860]   So those short-term hedges make a big difference.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:36.100]   And if you look at each line item on the budget, so food would be heavily subjected to major
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.460]   changes in inflation.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.740]   Gas purchases would be heavily subjected to major changes in inflation.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.260]   But your electricity costs, the utility companies are not going to be able to raise their electricity
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:50.160]   costs on a month-by-month basis to deal with a period of mass inflation.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:39:00.020]   So I think if you expand the mindset and open up the potential economic situations that
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:05.620]   you're planning for from beyond just a standard 3 to 4 to 5 percent annual increase in the
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:11.380]   consumer price index, now all of a sudden you do open up some ways that you can plan.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.380]   What say you?
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.420]   I hear the sighs coming in of the disagreement welling up.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.420]   So this will be fun.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.420]   Go ahead.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.420]   No, no, actually, I 100 percent agree.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:27.180]   And inflation—so I just wanted to start with kind of the base level of inflation because
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:33.260]   I think that's what we're kind of—the environment we've been in recently and maybe for the
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:40.500]   last decade and a half, two decades, we've had relatively low inflation, especially over
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   the last five years.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.340]   It's been close to zero.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.780]   It's not even close to the 3 percent.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:51.460]   So I wanted to start with kind of that basic, like, this is what inflation does sort of
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:52.460]   scenario.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.500]   But I'm much more worried about what you mentioned.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.860]   First though, before we switch over to those other crazy inflation scenarios, let me read
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:05.580]   a quote to you from Todd Tressiter's website, the financial mentor.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.820]   I think you had him on—you interviewed him before in the past.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.580]   Because he says—I was looking for numbers around inflation and he just says this example
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:18.020]   so much better than I could, so I'm just going to read just a paragraph here.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:23.820]   He said, "A couple retiring in their 40s with at least one partner making it to their 90s
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.620]   can expect their purchasing power at 4.5 percent average inflation to get cut in half three
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.780]   times during their retirement.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:35.900]   A dollar today would be worth little more than a dime when you're infirm and dependent.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.260]   That's a very big deal.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.420]   If you think this example is far-fetched and can't apply to you, then think again.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.700]   According to Charles Ellison, winning the Losers' Game, $100 of goods in 1960 would
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.380]   have cost $500 in 1995.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.580]   That's a 4.8 annual compound inflation rate that destroyed 80 percent of your purchasing
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.580]   power."
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:58.460]   So, I mean, this is what we've seen in the U.S. over, you know, maybe not over the last
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.100]   five years or over the last ten years.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.860]   But I'm always cautious when people say, "Oh, well, this is the new normal.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.100]   This is—it's different this time."
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.200]   And so while we've seen some lower inflation rates, I think we very well could go back
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.020]   to an average of more like 4 to 5 percent.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:20.300]   And if you're an early retiree, a few decades later, your purchasing power has been cut
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:25.260]   in half and cut in half and cut in half, it's worrisome.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:31.180]   But going back to your point, in the '70s, that's really what worries me, is not so much
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:38.580]   this mundane inflation that's really not that mundane, just because of compounding.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:44.560]   And we all always look at examples of, "Man, you invest this much and you do this for this
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.180]   number of years, and in 50 years you're a jillionaire."
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:53.380]   And we all look at compounding and it's amazing and it's great when it's working for you.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:42:00.780]   But when it's working against you, that kind of double-digit inflation in the '70s, '80s,
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:06.180]   and you get that multiple years in a row to where that double-digit inflation builds on
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:11.580]   itself and builds on itself because it's compounding, it's really scary.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:17.900]   It very quickly makes the value of your dollar a lot less.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.460]   Mad Fientist Oh, yeah, hugely.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.020]   Ryan Neuhofel So going back to, we kind of started talking
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.980]   about some ideas to protect yourself.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.420]   So one would be tips or I-bonds.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:37.660]   Another one is real estate, raising your rents as wages increase and they get cost of living
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.460]   raises and stuff like that.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:46.460]   Another kind of very popular one, I feel like the one you hear about most, is gold.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:52.780]   And gold typically is not a great investment, but it is viewed as an inflation hedge.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:57.420]   And it's one of the four main cornerstones of the permanent portfolio, which is trying
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:03.180]   to protect against a number of different downside scenarios, including inflation and deflation
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.140]   and all the different environments.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:12.560]   And a quarter of the permanent portfolio is kept in gold to help hedge against inflation.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:16.140]   So that's another good one for people to consider when they're looking at their asset allocation
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.580]   of how can I help protect myself.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.860]   Mad Fientist Do you have comments or perspective on the
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.180]   importance of investing in gold from your perspective?
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:33.340]   Ryan Neuhofel I think I'm not personally a fan of investing
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:38.060]   in gold because it's an unproductive asset.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:43.980]   There's a Warren Buffett quote, anyone listening can Google, that basically he talks about
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:51.900]   all the amount of gold that's been mined fits in this 90 by 90 cube inside a baseball, what's
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:56.740]   the word, not the outfield, the infield of the baseball stadium.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:02.820]   And it's worth X amount of dollars versus, and then he lists Chevron and all these oil
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.060]   companies, all these different companies that are generating billions of dollars in profits.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.820]   And he's like, and they're worth about the same, I know which one I'd rather own.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:16.820]   And so I don't like the idea of owning it as an investment.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:22.820]   I don't really like the idea of owning it while you are working, while you are accumulating,
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:28.580]   because theoretically if inflation happens while you are still working, hopefully your
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.980]   wages should rise with inflation.
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.460]   And that's not always the case.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.820]   But eventually they have to, because if things get too out of whack where people can't afford
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.900]   food, then you have riots in the street.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.580]   I don't see that happening in America.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.580]   So I do think wages, even if they may lag inflation somewhat, they'll kind of tend to
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:49.580]   catch up.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:56.420]   So that's your inflation hedge while you're working is your job.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:02.780]   And so, but I do see the value of having inflation hedges in retirement.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:07.260]   And so if someone says, yeah, gold is the one I've decided on for these particular reasons,
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.700]   I'm okay with that.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:13.580]   Let me read you the Warren Buffett quote.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.980]   So I asked the duck and the duck says, here's the quote.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.340]   I will say this about gold.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.620]   If you took all the gold in the world, it would roughly make a cube, 67 feet on a side.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:28.260]   Now for that same cube of gold, it would be worth at today's market prices about $7 trillion.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.740]   That's probably about a third of the value of all the stocks in the United States.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.340]   For $7 trillion, you could have all the farmland in the United States.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:39.160]   You could have about seven Exxon Mobiles and you could have a trillion dollars of walking
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.280]   around money.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.340]   And if you offered me the choice of looking at some 67 foot cube of gold and looking at
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.640]   it all day, and you know me touching it and fondling it occasionally, call me crazy,
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.380]   but I'll take the farmland and the Exxon Mobiles.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.180]   Now that's the version, this is the first version that popped up.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.660]   There are other quotes we talked about the putting in a swimming pool and things like
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.660]   that.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.940]   How I think about gold, and there's a lot of argument and debate about this, and I haven't
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.940]   presented shows on the different discussions.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:08.020]   I'll just talk from me personally without trying to give all the different sides of
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:12.180]   the stage.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:17.900]   If I had the money to simply retire on dividends from Exxon Mobile stock, I would rather do
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.820]   that any day than have gold.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.280]   And so because if you can own companies, if you can own great companies, and again, take
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.020]   Exxon Mobile, diversify your portfolio, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.740]   But if you owned fractional shares of 100 great companies and you were able to simply
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:36.860]   live on the dividends, those dividends over time are going to be your best inflation hedge
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.780]   because those companies, assuming that they are well run, those companies are going to
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.940]   be looking for new markets, they're going to be hiring, firing, buying, selling.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.100]   They're going to be dealing in the economy and they're dealing with the effect of the
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.020]   economy and as an owner, I'm gaining the dividends from that.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.620]   However, those dividends are not always going to lag.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.140]   Some of the companies are going to come in, some of the companies are going to go out.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.580]   But for me, the ultimate is just simply to be able to live off the dividends from the
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:03.820]   companies that I own.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.500]   And that's the same thing that we do when we are working in private business that we
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.020]   own or it's the same thing we do when we're investing in publicly traded stocks.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:17.420]   The major value of gold is for those times when things are changing.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:26.060]   And so the reason I want to have a good portfolio of gold coins I can put my hand on is number
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:31.220]   one, something funky happens and I got to get on a plane for Columbia, you need to be
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.700]   able to put your hands on some money.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.820]   I think everybody should have some walking around gold that they can put their hands
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.820]   on.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.820]   The crazy stuff has happened.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.260]   The biggest example I mentioned several times on the show is that dentist.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.140]   The dentist, now that wasn't bad because it was just the media publicity, the guy who
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.140]   killed the lion.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:53.540]   It was just media publicity but all of a sudden, his whole business falls apart.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.740]   Now in that situation, there's no need for gold coins.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:00.260]   You just need cash in the bank and money to transition to.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.140]   So at some point, you got to be able to put your hands on some money.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:09.460]   The other thing is just recognizing that every Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:14.220]   here in the United States and every national bank around the world, they own gold.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:22.060]   And so there is a stability there of that asset based upon the intrinsic characteristics
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:28.460]   of the fact that that's what the major banks of the world hold and own.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.220]   So that could give you some stability and then if you're looking at the economic environment
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:36.060]   around you, the question for those who own gold that I would challenge you is at what
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.500]   point in time are you going to sell?
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.340]   There should be almost no asset.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:45.020]   There should be no asset that we are allied to where we say, "This is the asset I'm going
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:46.820]   to own and I'm never going to sell."
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:51.180]   It doesn't matter whether it's a piece of real estate, whether it's a gold coin or whether
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.140]   it is your business.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.300]   Everything should have a price tag and you should understand, "Here's the point at which
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.740]   I'm going to sell."
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:06.700]   Because if you see a mispricing in the market, you see some things happening with the currency
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:12.980]   system or whatnot, now it's time to sell your gold coin to move back into other investments.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:18.020]   That's the opportunity I see is as gold, understanding its characteristics, understanding the value
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.700]   that it gives you and then understanding when you can go ahead and sell it and move into
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.700]   other asset classes.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:30.420]   Yeah, and I think the tricky part with doing that would be trying to value the gold, trying
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:36.180]   to put a number on that, "When am I going to sell it?"
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:41.520]   If you're saying, "Well, I'm going to sell it at $2,000 an ounce."
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.660]   The problem is if gold rises to that, we're probably in some economic times where the
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.860]   dollar's falling and we're having inflation and you hit that point and you say, "Well,
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.540]   no, I'm going to hold it a little longer and then it falls.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:59.740]   I mean, gold doesn't have a value in terms of its productivity.
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:03.740]   You can't look at it like you do a business and say, "This is how much revenues it had
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.220]   and this was its net profit."
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:13.980]   So putting that value on it can be difficult, which is why I think just a flat percentage
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.940]   is the best and easiest way to go.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:26.220]   Is to say, "I want to have 5% or 10% of my portfolio in gold and use it for rebalancing
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.220]   purposes essentially."
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:34.540]   Yeah, but then that's good as a general outline and I like that as a general outline, but
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.940]   then at some point in time, you should know.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.860]   I guess I just am convinced you should know when you're going to sell everything.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:48.740]   By that, I don't mean I got to sell everything I own, but we've got to be – instead of
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.020]   – we've got to be –
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.620]   Do you mean completely exiting a market and –
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.940]   Yeah, I mean paying attention to the relative value.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.340]   So if you're looking at your portfolio and in every biography I've read of people who
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:05.460]   get rich, like really rich, mega tycoons, things like that, what you'll often find
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.740]   is you'll often find them looking and seeing a mispricing in the market and going ahead
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.420]   and taking advantage of that based upon the assets that they have.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.020]   Now, those assets are sometimes just hard work.
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.140]   Sometimes it's just seeing an opportunity and having the work to do it.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.460]   Sometimes it's money.
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.560]   Sometimes it's selling a house and buying a business.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.900]   Sometimes it's selling a business and buying a house.
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.180]   But that in our lives, we can't sit on the sideline and say, "Well, I'm just going
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.180]   to do nothing."
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.480]   Rather, we should be prepared to be watching the market.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.460]   So we should understand what's going on.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:38.500]   If you tell me that there becomes a mispricing in the market where I can take some gold coins
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.420]   – I don't know, make up some crazy numbers.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.660]   We end up in mass inflation and I'm looking around at my local real estate market and
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:49.620]   I can buy a three-bedroom, two-bath house for a dozen one-ounce gold coins.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.300]   Well, I'm going to get rid of those coins and go buy the house because the coins have
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:59.500]   no worth whatsoever with regard to any utility function whereas the house has a utility function.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:04.100]   If I look at a market and say this housing price is very devalued, the price of this
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.620]   gold is high, I'm going to transition the gold asset into the real estate asset.
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.220]   Then as times change and I move forward a period of time, then I'm going to look down
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.220]   and I'm going to say, "You know what?
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.380]   I think I'm going to go ahead and rebuild my gold holdings.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.780]   The prices, the ratios have changed and now I'm going to go ahead and move into it."
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:25.140]   There's no reason to not have the approach of saying, "I'm going to buy and sell
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.460]   my assets as time goes forward."
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.580]   Now that's only –
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.860]   Let me give you a reason.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:39.900]   So I think all of that is phenomenal for a very sophisticated investor who can evaluate
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.980]   all of these different markets and move back and forth between them trying to time them.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:51.020]   I think that's difficult for a lot of people especially controlling the emotional aspect
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:53:00.580]   of it and I think that as we get older, our mental faculties may decline.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:07.140]   We may be more prone to, I don't know, paranoia.
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:12.220]   There's different factors that we deal with as we get older that may or may not be the
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:16.940]   case and certainly isn't for everyone, but there's still things you might have to deal
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:23.860]   with that I wouldn't be comfortable telling someone who's 70 to, "Okay, now's the
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:30.060]   time to sell your house because gold is really undervalued," or having them try and make
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   that decision.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:38.860]   So setting an asset allocation, making a plan for, "Here's what my investments are
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:46.900]   going to look like and gold is 10% of my portfolio and if a year from now gold has gone up by
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.860]   10 times in price and now I can use a little bit of it to buy that house," like your
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:56.100]   example of now, "Wow, I can use a couple of gold coins and buy a house because this
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:01.860]   gold didn't produce anything," well, what it produced was that inflation head, that
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.780]   diversification in an uncorrelated asset so that, "Wow, now it's worth a bunch more.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.820]   That gave me a bunch more money.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.900]   I'm going to sell off.
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:13.340]   Now gold is 50% of my portfolio because it shot up so much.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.980]   I'm going to sell off 40% of that gold so now I'm back down to just 10% still and
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:24.100]   invest that in my other assets that are lower," which may include a REIT that does own that
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.140]   house down the street.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:36.300]   I think in an ideal scenario a very intelligent, sophisticated investor who knows all those
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.060]   markets might be able to do what you're describing.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:44.660]   I think for most people a much more simple, "Here's my asset allocation and I'm going
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:49.860]   to stick with that and use rebalancing in order to do what you're describing."
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.740]   I don't have to worry about which market is overvalued, which market is undervalued.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:55.660]   I know, "Hey, gold has gone up a bunch.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.780]   It's a higher percentage than it should be in my portfolio.
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:05.060]   I'm going to sell some of it and buy this one that's lower because I'm just rebalancing
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.140]   my allocation."
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:13.620]   You make good points and I'll accept most of them but I will just simply respond and
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.620]   say why I'm making the point that I'm making.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:22.500]   I come from the formal financial advisor world and if I were a formal financial advisor still
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.860]   then I would have to give that answer.
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.580]   The rules in the financial advisor world is that we assume our clients are ignorant and
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.420]   we have to protect them from themselves.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:36.740]   That's the reality is most people are ignorant and we have to protect them from themselves.
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:43.460]   I would never feel comfortable personally in a one-on-one situation, never is a strong
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.460]   word.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:50.220]   It's hard for me to imagine the scenario in which I would feel comfortable personally
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.300]   telling somebody the bet to make.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.700]   "Hey, look, you should sell your house and buy this investment asset or you should sell
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:02.540]   this investment asset and you should buy the house."
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:06.220]   Because that's going to affect their life and I'm not sure if they're ready with the
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.660]   pros and cons.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:13.580]   But I'll tell you this for me, after years of studying mainstream finance and after years
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:18.380]   of being a mainstream financial advisor, I'm done with the crap that the mainstream financial
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.980]   advice world puts out.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:27.140]   Now, if I'm running a pension portfolio for 40,000 retired school teachers then I'm going
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.020]   to follow traditional asset allocation rules.
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:34.140]   I'm going to stick to that with safety and my reason is twofold.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.540]   Number one, it's probably the best move for me to protect those pensioners' income but
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.460]   it's also going to cover my butt, which is what all of the investment managers have to
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.460]   do.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.060]   You cannot go too far out of the mainstream.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:49.340]   So if everyone goes down together but we all follow the mainstream approach, well, at least
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.660]   we're all protected.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:55.500]   So I sort through all the advice and say, "Okay, how much of this is actually true and
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.960]   how much of this is good planning versus how much of this is just simply somebody protecting
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.960]   their butt?"
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:06.160]   As a financial advisor, you cannot make interesting recommendations and interesting analyses.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.120]   But what I started to look at is I said, "What do the rich people actually do?"
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:13.880]   What I realized is that the rich people actually, the people who live high lifestyles, whether
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.360]   they have a million dollars in the bank or they just live a really great lifestyle, they're
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:21.480]   always buying and selling based upon the value in their local markets.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:25.940]   This is the fundamental function that's been lost in today's world's approach to investing.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:32.080]   So I would rather my 18-year-old son, I would rather he not put any money in the stock market
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.760]   and I would rather he learn to buy and sell lawnmowers in the fall and snowblowers – and
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.640]   he buys lawnmowers in the fall and sells them in the spring and buys snowblowers in the
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:47.360]   spring and sells them in the fall and learn to judge the value of assets and then buy
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.680]   and trade them.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:52.320]   And when I look at it, yes, there is a level of sophistication where if you're running
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.480]   a large fund and you're getting paid, you need to be very sophisticated to understand
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.080]   the values of large markets.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.000]   But I don't think the average person, if they pay attention, they're a listener to
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.620]   this show, if they pay attention, you don't have to be that sophisticated to get a sensing
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:08.120]   in your local market of, "You know what?
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.360]   Things are a little bit out of whack."
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:15.420]   If your taxi driver is telling you about their real estate rental houses, it might be time
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.680]   to sell and sit back and stick your money in cash and sit back and wait for some deals
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.680]   again.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.600]   So I guess it's a challenge for me to work through and say, "What is the approach?"
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:31.640]   And here in this context, I'm talking about like you and me as individuals, as individuals
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:39.560]   who are desiring to live a free lifestyle, then we're going to get far, farther by paying
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.480]   a little bit of attention to education, paying attention to the markets and then dealing
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:51.520]   with the opportunities that we have than we are by taking a mainstream approach.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.520]   What say you?
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:59:00.320]   I really do, by the way, I really do struggle with these things which is why we're just
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.960]   kind of having a conversation.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.840]   Feel free to disagree but I struggle how to articulate this because I look around and
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:11.820]   I see the stuff that people preach is not the stuff that works.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:16.140]   And so what I try to do on the show is I try to give the academic background but the reality
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:20.280]   is many of the people who develop the academic background are broke and look at what the
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.280]   rich people do.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:26.440]   Look at what the rich people do and do what they do, not what the people who are teaching
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.520]   about finance teach people to do with their money.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.520]   Okay.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:39.960]   And that makes sense and for an 18-year-old son who's going to be starting a career, some
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:48.040]   sort of active business entrepreneurship will probably make him a lot more than just passive
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.400]   investing in the stock market.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:57.240]   And that's one reason why my wife and I were able to retire so early is active real estate
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:58.240]   investing.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.920]   I read dozens and dozens of books, I went to real estate meetings and different training
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:09.880]   sessions and after school I would be looking at rental properties and it was fun for me.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.200]   I enjoyed it but it was also extra work but it made us a lot higher return than I would
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.040]   have netted otherwise.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:25.520]   So I'm in 100% agreement that that is valuable and that that's a good way to get rich.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:35.760]   The part where I disagree is when I'm thinking of the typical early retiree who, however
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.320]   early they are retired or whether they retired at a regular age, whether they're in their
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:46.680]   30s, 40s, 50s or older and they're thinking about inflation, I don't necessarily think
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:54.920]   that just saying, "Well, deal with, just have your money in assets that are low and
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.280]   then when they get high, shift it over to other assets."
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.320]   I think, I just don't think a lot of people do have that proclivity or necessarily even
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   want to.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.800]   They don't want to buy snowblowers and they don't want.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:14.400]   So a more passive portfolio designed to their risk tolerance and with all these different
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.640]   things in mind, thinking about inflation and how they're going to feel with different risks
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.200]   of how are they going to feel if the market falls 30% tomorrow, that sort of thing, is
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:34.920]   going to provide them a more stable base than trying to say, "Well, here's a more optimal
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.560]   way if you know what you're doing, good luck."
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.600]   I absolutely agree with you and you make good points which is why it's so challenging in
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.960]   the course of conversation to get the nuances out.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.160]   I agree with you.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.600]   But we should always be paying attention to the relative value.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.320]   And so if you were looking at your, you're traveling in Chiang Mai, Thailand or you're
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.280]   traveling in Croatia and let's say you've been there for a year and you're looking around
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.840]   and you're looking at what the rental prices are working at and you're looking at some
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.600]   of the resorts in the local area and all of a sudden you find out that real estate prices
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.680]   in the United States have just massively increased in a very short period of time and you start
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.360]   to get the sense that, "Man, there's a little bit of a, it feels like a bubble."
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.120]   And you're looking at wages, is there anything that's really causing demand to go up, that's
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.160]   really solid on my rental properties?
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   You would start to think about saying, "I've got these values, some of these deals over
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:39.000]   here that are much more valued and I can buy land and develop it and you're researching
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   that and I've got this overvalued property in the United States."
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.920]   You'd probably start selling a few units and transitioning to something else.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.880]   And so it's definitely not all or nothing.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.680]   But I know for me, I wouldn't, as an early retiree, who knows, maybe when I get there
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.720]   then I'll be able to say, but it's hard for me to think that you'd be all in on anything.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.880]   You're not all in on real estate, you're not all in on stocks, you're not all in on gold.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:07.760]   It is a balanced, diversified approach but you are paying attention, I guess, to your
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   portfolio and looking for deals.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.760]   Is that accurate?
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.960]   And I think that's where proper planning comes in.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.880]   But you're right, it's definitely a balance and a mix of different things to both grow
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:31.040]   your portfolio, protect against different potential downsides and just tailor to what
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.280]   your experiences and interests have made you more knowledgeable of.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.640]   I may be able to evaluate certain types of real estate but I would have no clue what
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.760]   I'm doing if it came to investing in commodities as an inflation hedge.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   Agreed.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.600]   I would just, yeah, exactly.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.920]   So yeah, I think it's very individual.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   It is hard to generalize.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   Right.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.240]   And that's where one of my convictions is that we should be teaching people to invest
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.040]   in the things that they know.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:14.240]   And so what has happened is the financial advice industry has hijacked the word "invest"
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.680]   from people.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.920]   Investing has become about putting money in your 401(k).
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.880]   And constantly I'm talking with people just in my personal life or even in a professional
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.680]   life who are investing through their 401(k), they're investing in mutual funds and they
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.840]   don't even have the slightest concept of what those things are and how they work.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.600]   Well that's how you get taken advantage of is if you don't have a concept of what they
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.000]   are and how they work.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.600]   They're excellent tools and it's hard for me to beat.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.360]   If you can earn a couple hundred thousand dollars a year doing a job that is important
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:49.200]   to you and you can just stuff money aside in the 401(k), buy low-cost funds, it's hard
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:56.920]   to beat that from a simplicity and an efficiency standpoint of an investing perspective because
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.720]   the investments are taking care of your life.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.320]   But that's not the right for everybody and what other people should be doing is investing
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.680]   in what they know.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.920]   And when I look at people, I mean I have some experiences even just in the last couple of
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.760]   weeks where I know some people who are very, very rich but you would never know it.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:18.040]   It comes down to their skill of buying and selling the things that they need and providing
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.200]   for themselves with good deals.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.840]   Now you can't invest $100,000 in snowblowers but you can teach your kid how to invest $100
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.880]   in snowblowers, how to flip that and then when they get to the $100,000, that's all
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.880]   they do.
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.460]   And so when Warren Buffet, to pick on him, the guy who always gets picked on, when he's
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.640]   paying a billion dollars for a percentage of a company, he's doing the same thing.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.840]   He's trying to figure out how to allocate the capital in a market that is strong.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840]   I agree.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.600]   I don't know if we beat the dead horse or if it was interesting.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.600]   Go ahead.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.720]   The one caveat I do want to add though is you are mentioning – you're talking about
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:04.000]   how to get very wealthy and you keep saying the very rich people and I personally and
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.560]   quite a few people who are kind of in the early retirement different communities online
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.280]   are very big into the concept of enough.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.880]   We don't want to get super rich.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:18.400]   We want to have enough to live comfortably and hedge against potential downsides and
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   then spend all of our time doing the things that we enjoy and that may make money or it
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.680]   may not.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:33.880]   We don't care but we're not interested in having tens of millions or more, hundreds
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.640]   of millions.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.980]   So go ahead.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:45.640]   But if that's the case, I think if you wanted to be very rich, like right now if I needed
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:55.960]   to make $20 million in the next five or 10 years and I wanted to become very rich relatively
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.720]   quickly, I would go read a book called The Millionaire Fastlane by M.J.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.720]   DiMarco.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720]   M.J. DiMarco.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.720]   Have you read that book?
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720]   Yes.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   Okay.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   I love it.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.480]   The title is gimmicky for anyone listening.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:17.640]   The Millionaire Fastlane sounds so gimmicky but it's a phenomenal book in terms of it's
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.120]   just all about here's how you build a business that provides value.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.760]   His general thesis is like the more people you impact, the more money you can make or
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.920]   if you impact less people, impacting them to a greater degree.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.120]   But it's all about the impact you make on people's lives, then you can make a lot of
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120]   money.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:39.320]   And he talks about how to build a business to do that and it's just filled with solid
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.320]   tips.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.600]   I would go, I've read it, I would go basically reread that two times in a row, spend the
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.840]   next two days just like reading it twice through and then implement everything in that book.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.680]   And I think that's the best way to actually get really, really rich.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:08:02.460]   And this is obviously just my personal opinion but it's building a company and investing
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:08.320]   is a way to get rich slowly over time but it's a lot more probable.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.920]   It's a lot more secured and likely.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:16.760]   If you're steadily investing in a passive index fund for 20 years, you're going to do
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.440]   pretty well.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.160]   But you may not be massively rich at the end.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.680]   So, I hope you don't feel like I'm just arguing with you.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.800]   Hopefully listeners will just like this back and forth as far as you two.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.140]   I love debating so I don't mind at all.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.140]   Hopefully I can get some out of you.
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.140]   Good.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.140]   So, it's up to them to listen or not.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.140]   But I'll tell you.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.140]   So, I don't actually care.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:42.140]   I don't make the differentiation you made about becoming really, really rich.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:46.540]   I also come from the perspective of what is enough.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:52.500]   So with my personal plan, I don't ever intend to live a lifestyle that is massive because
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:57.020]   I've got much more important things to do with the money than just simply to turn it
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.540]   into personal lifestyle.
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:02.000]   So whether it's $20 million or $30 million, to me, that doesn't matter.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:11.360]   I think that it's mostly irrelevant to most people who are focusing on the details of
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:17.420]   their financial lives of how to actually go through and make it happen.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.880]   The key thing that I am focusing on is just simply how do you build a plan that's going
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.000]   to work for you in your specific situation.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.520]   The likely way that you're going to do that is by focusing on the minimum level that you
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.880]   need to cover your lifestyle.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.480]   So that might be as simple as three rental properties.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:39.540]   If you need $3,000 a month and you own three rental houses, which in net, given allowances
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:45.560]   for vacancies and repairs, net you $1,000 a month each, you're now financially independent.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.440]   And so I would focus first on developing that.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.800]   And if that were my plan, if I needed $3,000 a month, I would focus everything on getting
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.480]   those three rental properties.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.900]   I would not buy gold coins.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.720]   I would not buy any of those other things.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.160]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.160]   I wouldn't focus on that.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.800]   I'd focus first on the rental properties.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.480]   But then as you have the rental properties, if you continue to have excess, which you
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.480]   will, you'll start to have continued excess.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.960]   Now how do I diversify that?
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.980]   And that's when you start to push, you start to adjust your portfolio.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.120]   And so I'm always interested in levering up.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.320]   I wouldn't risk it all.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.720]   Once you've built a certain lifestyle for yourself, I wouldn't want to risk it all.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:32.400]   But I would want to focus on, I guess, looking for the opportunities that are there because
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:37.200]   we should be working to make our portfolios as productive as possible as we go through.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.960]   So it's not a matter for me of $10 million or not.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.720]   It's just a matter of how to approach it.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.640]   And we approach it within the context of goals.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.520]   What are our initial major focuses?
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.680]   If gold coins are not going to help you be an early retiree until you've got the money,
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.060]   you need an income plan.
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:56.880]   And so once you've built that income plan, now for some level of security or some level
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.040]   of defense, then gold coins might help you with your portfolio.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:09.940]   And I love all of that for you and for the investor who's interested in that.
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:16.840]   But for someone who's, let's say they've worked as a, I don't know, a nurse or a computer
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:22.000]   program or whatever, somebody who's just invested in their 401(k) and they've had a super high
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.880]   savings rate, they've saved 50, 60, 70% of their income and just dumped it into passive
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:33.400]   index funds, whatever, and they're going to be relying on the 4% rule, I think their plan
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   is just fine.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:42.200]   I think that the interested active investor who gets those rental properties as their
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:47.120]   kind of their base and then they start diversifying out from that.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.320]   And so I'm not putting down that plan because that's exactly what I did.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.680]   We got a bunch of rental properties.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:59.040]   I'm very overweighted in real estate and our additional income right now is going into
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.560]   diversifying into more other assets.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.760]   So what you described is literally exactly what I'm doing.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.160]   So I'm not knocking that at all.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.560]   I'm a big fan of it.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.280]   But I'm also, know that I'm different than a lot of people.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:18.360]   And you and I are both different than maybe a lot of people who would love to retire early.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:23.640]   I see people come on, but they don't have a clue about investing and they have no interest.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.000]   They will learn it because they feel like they have to.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   But once they're retired, they don't want to think about money.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.880]   They want to get those dividend checks every month and I'm done.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:44.240]   I don't want to look at what is the S&P at and what's the current price to earnings ratio.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.060]   They don't have no interest in that.
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:53.440]   And so I think it comes down to the individual.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:13:00.240]   If we were designing a plan for you or for me versus a plan for my sister, they'd look
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240]   very different.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.240]   Agreed.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.860]   Now, here's my question.
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:11.280]   Do you know anybody, and I'm not talking about somebody new who's come onto the boards, onto
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.440]   the discussion forums and said, "Hey, I just started reading Money Mustache and now two
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.840]   weeks later I'm going to get this early retirement thing and I'm going to retire in two years."
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.640]   I'm not talking about a new person.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.960]   Somebody who's actually worked their way through, built financial independence and has actually
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.920]   followed through and pulled out of the workforce in order to live a financially independent
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.840]   lifestyle or who's at that point.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.120]   Do you know anybody who has done that, who doesn't also take at least a serious interest
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.120]   in their money?
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.780]   I mean, I don't know how you're defining a serious interest in their money.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.000]   Most of them, to get to that point, you're going to need to at least take an interest
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.280]   in your spending because you will need to be doing more than the save 5% to 10% of your
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   income thing.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.040]   So, they will probably have quite reduced expenses.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:05.920]   They will have an interest in their money but not necessarily an interest in investing.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.720]   I do not care personally.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.320]   I don't care about the stock market.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:15.000]   I find it utterly boring as far as it's my least favorite thing to talk about.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.140]   But I care about investing.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:21.460]   I just don't care about figuring out what is the P/E ratio of the stock that I'm watching.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.900]   So I can empathize with that perspective.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:32.600]   What I look at is I just look at the fact that you cannot get rich and stay rich unless
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.140]   you are interested in your money.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.860]   It's not going to happen.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.740]   So a good starting point is going to be to say, "Okay, put money in your 401(k)," but
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.940]   then you got to say, "Let's pay attention to your 401(k)."
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:47.340]   Now, there are a bunch of plans that can work but somebody has got to pay attention.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.020]   They've got to read Jack Bogle's book and say, "Well, let's see.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.220]   Which funds from Vanguard are going to give me what I need?
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:53.220]   Oh, look.
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.340]   Jim Collins says I just need this total stock market index fund.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   Okay.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   That makes sense to me.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:00.020]   I'll buy this total stock market index fund and I'll live off of that," and they understand
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.020]   their plan.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:04.620]   Then you'll look at someone who understands and says, "Oh, I read the portfolio approach.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.820]   This makes sense to me.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.260]   They understand their plan."
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:11.380]   But they've got to – people have to get focused and understand what they're actually
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.020]   going to do in order to make it.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:18.740]   So that – the more efficient they want to be and the faster they want to get there,
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.020]   the more they've got to pay attention.
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.300]   I just don't see any other option.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.300]   Okay.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.900]   I completely agree with that.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:30.980]   My point was the person who decides, "Hey, I like this balanced 60/40 equities bonds
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:36.780]   portfolio," or, "Hey, I like the permanent portfolio," or whatever they decide, choosing
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:42.380]   that asset allocation and sticking with that while they're retired and having it be completely
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:48.300]   passive may fit a lot more with their proclivities of, "I'm not interested in investing.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.500]   I had to at least learn the basics.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.700]   I had to go read Jim Collins' stock series and go, 'Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.260]   I buy that theory.
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:57.260]   That will work for me.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.660]   I'm okay with the volatility and that's how I'm going to invest my money.'"
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:04.700]   You're right that they need to learn about it, make those initial decisions, consider
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:10.860]   the different options, that sort of stuff, but they may not enjoy it and they may not
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:14.060]   want to continue doing that sort of activity in retirement.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:18.300]   If they've decided, "This is the portfolio that works for me.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.780]   It's quite passive and that's one of the pros of it for me.
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:26.660]   That's why one of the main reasons – one of the main draws," then they won't necessarily
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:33.100]   be doing anything, actively deciding, "Hey, this market's overvalued," that sort of
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.100]   thing.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:40.700]   If they wanted to get really rich, yes, but I think lots of people who just go, "Okay,
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.780]   I've saved up for my job for the last 20 years.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.780]   I'm good.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:50.060]   I've just been very frugal and now I'm done, done working and I just want a passive
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:55.140]   portfolio where I just collect my dividends every month or every quarter.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:56.140]   I'm good."
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.140]   I think that's quite common.
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:02.460]   Best thing for the people in that situation to do is going to be pile up your money, call
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:06.260]   Northern Trust or Bessemer Trust and say, "Here, I don't want to pay attention.
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.780]   I'll pay you to pay attention to my money for me.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   I just want to live in retirement."
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.460]   There are some other good solutions too.
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:17.380]   I like the Target Retirement Date Funds that Vanguard has.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:22.660]   I think that's a fairly good solution.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:28.740]   Let me plug one cool tool that I just found out over the last few months, just discovered
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.260]   and I think it was only created a few months ago but it's amazing.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:36.180]   It's called PortfolioCharts.com.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:44.100]   It lets you put in different asset allocations for all kinds of different—now, obviously,
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:47.220]   something like a rental property it can't cover or a business you're running yourself
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:52.940]   but all the traditional kind of standard types of investments and a lot of some non-standard
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:18:00.260]   ones too that he has data for and look at how did those returns happen versus the volatility
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:04.260]   that they present.
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:10.860]   Then it just visualizes it in just the most beautiful ways, makes these charts and it
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:21.820]   shows what your safe withdrawal rate could be for these different potential portfolios.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.540]   It shows you how long would it have taken you to work on average and with the standard
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:28.980]   deviation and then it shows it in a chart so it's pretty so you don't have to understand
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.100]   what standard deviation is.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:36.020]   It shows you how long it would have taken to retire if you had 100% equities portfolio
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:43.020]   over 1979 or if you had 100% gold portfolio or a mix of those or you had this percent
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:47.260]   bonds or you can basically just put in whatever percent you want of all these different things
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:52.540]   and it'll show you how long would it have taken you to retire if you had that as your
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.540]   allocation.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:57.460]   How long would it—what sort of volatility would you have?
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.980]   It's just fun to go on there and play around.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:03.040]   If you are one of those people who are interested in this sort of stuff, learning about this
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.780]   and then he's got a little blog on there where he posted some different—like here's
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:13.580]   a potential allocation that's really interesting to look at or here's this new calculator.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:19.120]   It's worth—he had a post a month or two ago called the Golden Butterfly which is kind
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.960]   of a tweak on the permanent portfolio that he made that was just fascinating to me looking
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.560]   at this asset allocation for this portfolio that I would have never considered.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:35.940]   So if you are into that sort of stuff, it's a fun site to check out, portfoliocharts.com.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.940]   Cool.
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.400]   I'll try to link to it in the show notes.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:44.180]   Any other resources or ideas that you think would be useful for people trying to solve
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.180]   through this problem?
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.180]   So let's see.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:53.340]   The kind of circling back to—we kind of got a little off topic but going back to inflation,
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:20:01.580]   there's a cool site called westegg.com/inflation that has all the inflation data from the year
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:06.460]   1800 up through last year, 2014.
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:12.660]   You can put in a dollar amount and starting and ending year and it will tell you how much
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.900]   that amount would have been worth.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:19.700]   So if you're like, "Well, my grandfather said his house was $5,000 in 1925.
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.580]   How much is that today?"
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:24.540]   Or "I have this much today.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:27.580]   What would that have been equivalent to back 30 years ago?"
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.100]   You know, "Oh, my salary this year."
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:35.580]   So it's fun to play around with a cool inflation tool to just see how it actually played out
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:39.980]   historically.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:49.500]   I think thinking about early retirees and inflation, it's important to go on and play
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:58.460]   with retirement calculators and look at what does inflation—change some of those inflation
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:02.060]   assumption rates and see what that does to your portfolio.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:06.180]   And then also make sure you use ones that are not just like have you put in a fixed
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:13.100]   number guess but do a Monte Carlo sim that will show a whole range of scenarios.
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:22.460]   And then also use a tool like C-FIRESIM, the letter C and then F-I-R-E-S-I-M.com, which
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:29.100]   uses historical inflation when it's in historical interest rates—or not interest, like market
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:32.500]   returns—to calculate how your portfolio would have done historically.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:43.020]   So using actual real-world data, there's no easy answer, but it's important to get a feel
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:50.060]   for what might it look like and playing around with those different scenarios and getting
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:56.540]   comfortable with the idea and then coming up with different plans to help think about
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:57.540]   it.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.780]   One thing you said earlier when you mentioned your thoughts on gold is you said that you
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:06.980]   would rather have those productive assets, those businesses making money.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:13.640]   And that's one of the best inflation hedges in my mind is if you are investing in equities,
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:19.300]   if you have an index fund, I think a lot of retirees worry about a market crash, and so
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.120]   they don't want to put too much in stocks.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.480]   And so they have a high cash allocation and they have a lot of fixed-rate bonds.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.420]   And the problem is that inflation just destroys that.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.060]   And you can recover from a market crash.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:38.500]   You can kind of wait it out and the stocks will recover, but you're probably not going
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:39.620]   to get buying power back.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:45.420]   We're probably not going to have deflation for decades that's going to re-get you your
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.420]   buying power back.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:51.940]   So I think it's important for an early retiree to look at that.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:58.500]   And owning equities, having a high enough stock percentage, because when prices are
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:04.500]   going up, if food is going up, if gas is going up, if clothes are going up, but you own the
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.700]   companies that are selling that food and selling that gas and selling those clothes, you're
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:11.660]   getting more profits.
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:18.100]   And that's why it may be scary to go, oh, no, the stock market's tanked.
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:22.140]   As inflation happens in the stock markets, I need to sell.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:28.140]   But keep in mind that those companies are still generating profits.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:32.100]   They're selling those items that are now at an increased cost.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:35.780]   And you as the owner of that company are earning those profits.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.980]   And even if the stock market drops, it eventually will correct.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:47.980]   Mad Fientist: I had a friend of mine who primarily earned their income from a portfolio of oil
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:51.660]   wells that a family member had put together.
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:56.820]   And I just remember when gas was up at $4 a gallon here in the States, I remember kind
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:58.380]   of just thinking about it.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.180]   I was bemoaning it.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.860]   And the person said to me, "Hey, it's great for me.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.740]   I'm getting bigger checks than I've ever gotten in my life."
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.780]   And so, it's kind of a cool way to balance it.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:11.820]   If you own some oil wells or some oil stocks or whatever way that you're investing in
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:15.860]   the oil market, if gas prices are low, you're not making a lot of money, but you can enjoy
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:18.120]   the low cost of traveling in your car.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.700]   If gas prices are high, you can hurt a little bit when you fill up your tank, but you can
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:25.420]   sit back and enjoy the nice big fat checks coming into your bank account.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.420]   It's a good place to be.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.420]   Absolutely.
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:31.380]   And I think there are specific strategies I've heard of where people will buy stock
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:36.020]   in their local electric company and buy stock in their local natural gas company.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:42.700]   And the utility companies that they pay money to every month, well, if those utility costs
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:47.260]   rise, theoretically, so should the price of those stocks or at least the dividends and
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:51.180]   the amount of profit that those companies are making, the revenues.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:58.140]   And so, that's definitely another kind of fun mental hedge too for inflation is like,
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.820]   "Oh, my electricity went up per kilowatt, but hey, I'm at least paying some of it to
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:03.820]   myself."
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:04.820]   Right.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:05.820]   Right.
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:06.820]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.340]   I guess, I think it's been a good conversation.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.860]   Sorry, before I wrap up, anything else, Joe?
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:17.140]   No, I think we covered quite a bit.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:20.340]   It's definitely an interesting topic.
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:23.620]   I think there's a lot of resources online.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.220]   The financial mentor, Todd Treseder, that I mentioned earlier, he's written a fair amount
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:28.980]   about inflation for retirees.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:33.300]   So Google "financial mentor inflation" and that'll give you some more articles to read
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:38.460]   if you're interested in the topic because it's a fascinating one for me just thinking
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:49.100]   about how money works and how the value of it just really changes over time.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.820]   The challenge of these types of conversations, and I think it's been a good conversation,
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:57.140]   a good introduction, but the challenge that has emerged is the question of speaking in
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:01.220]   broad generalities versus specific application.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.960]   And this is always the problem.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.780]   And so, what we've done is many people talk about inflation from the perspective of the
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.300]   large scale economy in general.
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.900]   And that's what the CPI is measuring.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:18.020]   Well, you can home in a little bit more to the inflation in your town or in your state
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:20.340]   or in your industry or things like that.
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.020]   When you start to dig into financial strategies, you can go with financial strategies for the
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:27.620]   mainstream than financial strategies for the early retirees.
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:31.740]   But the true power is going to be to hone in on your situation.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.860]   And so, that's what's emerged even in the conversation.
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:38.060]   You can hear Joe's perspective and my perspective of our situation.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:45.940]   And frankly, Joe, it's very difficult for me to bring together the concept that is prominent
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:52.940]   in early retiree scenarios, the idea that, well, we're going to retire at 30 on a portfolio
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:58.500]   of passive index funds because I can't find, with the exception of Doug Nordman, I can't
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:04.580]   find anybody who's actually followed through and retired at 30 and done it for 40 or 50,
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:09.820]   excuse me, and lived for 70 years on their portfolio, maybe Doug Nordman and Joe Dominguez.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:10.820]   That's about it.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:14.020]   And I'm sure there are a couple out there, but I think it's a little unrealistic to say
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.980]   that this is going to be the approach.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.020]   Rather, that's why I bring in things like business.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:21.540]   That's why I bring in these other things and say, "This is a much more expansive, inclusive
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.540]   opportunity."
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:28.580]   And this is what people are actually doing, is they're actually, at some point in time,
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:30.340]   you're still going to be buying and selling real estate.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:33.460]   Some point in time, you're going to find some little thing that you care about, whether
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:41.060]   it's running a canoe outfit or operation in Chiang Mai, Thailand or something, and you're
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.060]   going to be back in business.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:45.140]   And then you're going to be filtering that in, and then you're going to sell that business
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.800]   because you get a good deal on it.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.980]   This is the way that the world works.
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:54.140]   It's not this approach to passive portfolio perfection.
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:03.420]   I agree that you may make more money doing those sort of passions, but not necessarily
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:06.060]   doing it for the money.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:13.340]   So your main base may still just be the passive portfolio and you're doing the hobby income
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.340]   for fun.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.740]   But yeah, yeah.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.980]   I agree that there's very few.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:25.100]   I think the problem is it's a selection bias, a sample bias, in that most of the people
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:31.540]   who do get there to that early retirement are because they are interested in that and
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.660]   become interested.
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:38.820]   And so if someone's not interested in their money, it's rare, or not interested in investing,
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:42.500]   it's a lot more difficult for them to achieve that.
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:46.620]   And I wouldn't even necessarily count Nords in there because he's got the military pension.
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:53.020]   Yeah, I think Paul and Vicky Terhorst, I think there's some out there.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:59.660]   And I think there's more than we know about that don't necessarily blog because they're
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.460]   not interested in talking about financial topics because they're not that interested
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.460]   in it.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:11.740]   But I definitely have seen people post questions like, is there anybody out there who actually
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:17.500]   built up a big passive portfolio, takes 4% a year, and there are people that are like,
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.940]   yeah, yeah, I do that.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:23.180]   And then there are other ones who get into angel fund investing and who do all kinds
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.180]   of other stuff.
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:28.740]   And so it's definitely-- there's a range.
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:34.900]   But you're right in that most of us seem to be more active and interested in our investments.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:36.340]   And I think that's a great thing.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:39.620]   What you focus on, that's where your energy goes.
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:41.980]   And when you focus on your money, then it can start to grow.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.540]   So Joe, thanks for coming on.
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:47.740]   Is there anywhere-- are you blogging or posting anywhere about your trip?
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:51.980]   People can check out even just any personal stuff that you're sharing?
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:54.340]   Not yet.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:56.320]   We've talked about starting a blog.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:00.940]   My wife has actually written about a dozen blog posts for it.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:05.540]   But my computer died a couple weeks ago.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.300]   And it's a MacBook.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:09.780]   And I have AppleCare.
[01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:15.020]   But apparently, there is no Apple stores in Split, Croatia.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:18.540]   That-- AppleCare is not helpful when there's no Apple store.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:23.060]   So we did just-- we got to Zagreb a couple days ago and dropped it off at the store.
[01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:24.180]   And it's getting diagnosed.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:28.620]   So one of my-- people keep asking us about a blog, family members and friends who want
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:29.980]   to keep up with our travels.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.980]   And we'll probably eventually start something.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.620]   So maybe next time we chat, I'll be able to answer that better.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:38.100]   Well, at least just do Instagram or something.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.060]   I'd enjoy seeing pictures of the trip.
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.060]   And super simple.
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:44.420]   Instagram would be a simple way to share something.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:45.420]   That's a good idea.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.020]   I don't have one of those yet.
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:48.940]   But I will think about that.
[01:30:48.940 --> 01:30:49.940]   That's a good idea.
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:51.940]   We'll talk more offline.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.940]   But Instagram is the way to go.
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.940]   So.
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.940]   We'll see you on the show.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.060]   And we'll-- maybe another year, we'll be back in who knows what corner of the world
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.060]   you'll be in at that point.
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.060]   Cool.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:03.500]   Thank you so much, Joshua.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:10.260]   As you build wealth, develop wealth and work on your plan, you must take responsibility
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.980]   to control the risks of your plan.
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:16.580]   Every financial plan has risks.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:19.300]   Every stage of life has different risks.
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:23.920]   When you are an employee, inflation poses a certain risk.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:29.700]   But it's not nearly so difficult to manage inflation as an employee or business owner
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:33.100]   as it is if you are living on your nest egg.
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:36.580]   None of us know what the future holds.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.300]   But you had better have a plan for your money.
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.620]   So I hope the conversation today has perhaps given you some ideas.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:48.460]   I'm sure we didn't provide any real answers or specific advice.
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.980]   But hopefully at least it gave you the encouragement and motivation to go back and consider your
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:32:00.100]   plan and make sure that you have plans to handle the risks that face you and your money.
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:06.120]   Remember step four of the radical personal finance framework for wealth is avoid catastrophe.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:10.660]   And that means from time to time, you need to put on-- take off the rose tinted glasses
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.460]   and put on the dark and gloomy Eeyore glasses.
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:17.180]   Look at your situation and ask yourself, what are all the bad things that could happen from
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:20.300]   the mild to the wild?
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.500]   Ask yourself the question, what would you do?
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.780]   Now what's going to happen?
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.780]   I don't know.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:26.620]   Neither does anybody else.
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.660]   We all have ideas about it.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.780]   So my personal approach is just simply to recognize that I don't know and do my best
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:38.740]   to plan for all eventualities and give myself as many options as possible.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.820]   Can't always do that perfectly.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:41.860]   But a lot of times you can do it.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:45.180]   And I encourage you to stress test yourself.
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:50.220]   Ask yourself what you would do when facing inflation, mass inflation, hyperinflation.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:53.380]   Ask yourself what you would do and how would that affect your wealth.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.620]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
