[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Pastor John, you and I and a number of folks from Desiring God recently traveled to Orlando
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.080]   for the Gospel Coalition National Conference.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.120]   And looking back on the trip, is there any overflow from our time there that you want
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.560]   to share here with us now?
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.960]   And we should probably begin with the conference theme.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.280]   The theme of the conference was "Coming Home, the New Heavens and the New Earth."
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.080]   And one of the things I did there, I did about 12 things, I was just blown away with how
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.640]   much there was to do, but God was so good to give grace, as He always is.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.400]   But one of the things I did was a little seven-minute conversation, video conversation, with Scott
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.560]   Swain of RTS Orlando and Randy Alcorn, and the question that was pitched to us was popular
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.000]   misconceptions about heaven.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.960]   And of course, Randy is the global expert.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.640]   He wrote the big, excellent book on heaven.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.080]   So we began to talk about that, and both Randy and Scott called attention to the popular
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.520]   notion that the final destiny of believers is to be with God in a realm of the sky, beyond
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.900]   space and time, where we go when we die.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.300]   And both of them, of course, wanted to stress that, yes, we certainly do go to be with Christ
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.440]   immediately after we die.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.320]   2 Corinthians 5, 8, Paul says, "We are of good courage, and we would rather be away
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.160]   from the body and at home with the Lord."
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.200]   Philippians 1, 23, "I'm hard-pressed between the two.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.080]   My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.640]   They both say, "Yes, yes, amen, we will be with Christ immediately when we die."
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.080]   And Randy, however, the first thing he wanted to qualify in that conception was beyond time,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.520]   or time will be no more.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.920]   He said that old song that, I guess, my generation sang once upon a time, "Time will be no more."
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.320]   He said, "That's not right."
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.400]   He said, "There are a lot of indications that in heaven, in the new heavens, in the
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.240]   new earth, there will be time."
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.880]   And I suppose the best example would be that Jesus Christ has a body.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.280]   He took his bodily incarnate self back to heaven, and it's just mind-boggling to me
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.980]   to think that the second person of the Trinity has a body forever and ever.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.960]   But a body means space and time.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   And so that was the first qualification Randy wanted to give, that immediately after we
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.480]   die, we go to be with Christ, who is an embodied person there, and we wait for him to come
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.280]   and give us a new body here.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.000]   And both of them, Scott and Randy, wanted to say that, "Yes, we will be with Christ
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.960]   immediately when we die, but," Paul said, "that's not our final and best hope for what's
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.580]   coming in the future.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:26.240]   We will be with him, but we are going to be with him on a new earth, under a new heaven,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.880]   because Revelation 21 pictures the coming down to earth of heaven, as it were.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.960]   It says, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.080]   earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.340]   And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven, prepared as a bride."
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.920]   So this is the church adorned for her husband.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.000]   "And I heard a loud voice from the throne, 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   men.'"
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.240]   So here's God and man coming down for their final settlement on a new earth.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.280]   And that's, they both agreed, often in the Christian church not clearly perceived as
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.960]   we comfort people and give them their final and best hope.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:26.240]   It is not merely to die and go to be with Christ, but to be with Christ in the new heavens
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.280]   and the new earth.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.120]   So I expected us to go there, but the part of this conversation, this seven-minute conversation,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:44.760]   that made the trip worth it for me was the direction it took in asking how the hope of
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.040]   heaven now affects life now.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.960]   And it was the two ways that came together that struck me as fresh.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.160]   Scott pointed our attention to 1 John 3, 2, and that says, "Beloved, we are God's children
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.040]   now, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we'll
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   be like him, because we will see him as he is.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.000]   And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure."
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.520]   In other words, if you believe that you're going to see Christ and be changed by him
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:36.160]   into his likeness and you thus hope in him, it says, you will purify yourself as he is
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.160]   pure.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.040]   And that clobbered me in a powerful way, more than it ever had.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.320]   It's huge.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:52.960]   People who are not purifying themselves with a passion to be pure like Jesus are saying,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.040]   "He's not what I'm hoping for."
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.240]   And think about that.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:07.480]   The Bible says everyone who thus hopes in Jesus, that is, hopes to see and become like
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.700]   Jesus, purifies himself as he is pure.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:19.760]   So the test of whether we're hoping to see Jesus in his purity and be like him at that
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.440]   moment in his purity, because if we're not, we'll be consumed, the test of that is whether
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.140]   we're purifying ourselves now.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.140]   So that's huge.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:37.360]   I mean, if you have a hope for heaven, that means seeing Jesus as he is and being changed
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.040]   into his likeness, because you're seeing him as he is, that will be what you are doing
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.640]   with your life now.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.280]   And then the second one, the second way that hoping in heaven impacts our life now is so
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.480]   related to it in a way that I hadn't seen before.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:04.200]   The second way is that hoping in heaven, having this great reward of heaven makes us so happy
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:17.520]   now, so secure now, that we can joyfully endure any mistreatment here as we pursue purity
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.520]   or righteousness.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.560]   So here's the text, Matthew 5, 10.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.760]   "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   of heaven."
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.120]   So our persecution is for righteousness' sake, which is the same as the purity we're
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.720]   pursuing in 1 John.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.360]   "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.760]   against you falsely on my account.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.260]   Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven."
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.400]   So this is another absolutely astonishing statement.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:55.840]   When we are mistreated and slandered with every kind of vicious slander, we can and
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:03.920]   should rejoice and be glad and press on with living for righteousness' sake or pursuing
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.180]   that purity that 1 John spoke about.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:15.880]   So the hope of heaven and the greatness of our reward affects us in two ways, both of
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:23.720]   which empower purity of life here and now in the face of opposition.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:29.280]   It makes us passionate for purity because the one we hope to see and be with and be
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:37.560]   like is pure, and it makes us fearless and happy so that people can't stop us from
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.400]   pursuing this passion for purity and righteousness here.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.640]   So that, Tony, was a great encouragement to me, to see the nature of heaven made real
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:56.200]   in the new heavens and the new earth, and then to see how this double way of hope affecting
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.480]   my passion for purity and righteousness was a great incentive for me to get on with the
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   work.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
