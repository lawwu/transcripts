[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Pastor John, here is an interesting question from a single mom who has the
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.540]   gift of singleness, or she thinks she has the gift of singleness. Anna is her
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.400]   name and she writes this, "Pastor John, thank you for all of your wonderful
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.080]   service to our Lord. My question for you is one that I have wrestled with since
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.320]   the birth of my only child, a son. He's now three. I'm a single parent and have
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.040]   been since his conception and I thank the Lord for his work in my heart that
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.960]   has transformed my soul and lifestyle from where it was until now. Now as I
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.440]   attempt to wrap my head around the overwhelming task of raising this boy
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.080]   into a man by myself, I do not feel called to marriage, but am I obligated to
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.840]   find a godly mate to complete the model of a family that's clearly laid out in
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.160]   Scripture? As a single parent, is it forbidden for me to embrace a life of
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.480]   singleness and unhindered service to the Lord as described by Paul in 1
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.040]   Corinthians chapter 7?" Well I joined Anna in rejoicing that God has changed her
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.000]   life from those days, and it sounds really true that he has. Here's my short
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.640]   answer. No, no. Anna is not obligated to find a godly mate so that her son can
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.760]   have a father. I don't see any direct mandate in the Bible or clear
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.320]   implication of biblical teaching that rises to the level of obligation, so
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.640]   that's my short answer. My encouragement would be not in terms of obligation, but
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.640]   rather perhaps openness to marriage and prayer towards marriage. Let me
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.640]   just sow a few thoughts, Anna, into your thinking so that as you ponder and pray
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.040]   over the Scriptures, God might use these to direct your thinking. First,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.160]   Jesus, the incarnate Jesus that we know in the Gospels as an expression of God's
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.800]   own heart, has a special concern for mothers who have children to raise on
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.560]   their own. For example, in Luke 7, "As he drew near to the gate of the town, behold
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.640]   a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.280]   widow." So you got husband is gone and only son is gone, and this is the next
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   thing we read. "And a considerable crowd of the town was with her, and when the
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.560]   Lord saw her, he had compassion on her." Now I think sentences like that are in
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.520]   the Gospels precisely to encourage us to take heart. I mean, why would we be told
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.760]   that our Lord Jesus, the creator of the universe, the one who holds everything in
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.200]   being, the one who died for us, reigns over us now and cares for us and is with us to
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.840]   the end of the age, has compassion on a woman who has lost her husband and who
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.480]   has now lost her son. And he says, "Do not weep." So I think the point of the story
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.640]   is definitely he has power to raise the dead, which he does. He raises the
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.840]   boy from the dead, but he does it, he uses that kind of power in the service
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:45.600]   of compassion for someone for whom life has dealt a very difficult hand, and that
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   would be the case for Anna. So the first thing, I think, Anna, is to take heart
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:59.160]   that Jesus has a special kind of compassion for women in your situation.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:08.080]   Number two, never think of the family, the nuclear family, husband, wife, children, as
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:17.520]   the only or the eternal or the main family with which God is concerned. The
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:27.640]   church is God's main family on the earth. In the age to come, there will be, it
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.240]   seems, no nuclear family because Jesus says in that age we will have neither
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.640]   marriage nor giving in marriage. The nuclear family is temporary, and the
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.200]   eternal family is the church with God as our Father and all of us as brothers and
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.000]   sisters. So I would want to elevate—she didn't mention the church, but
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.200]   I'm sowing the seed for her to think about—I would want to elevate the local
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.800]   church as the expression of God's family for her life. I think that's
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:12.600]   precisely where she should embed this child in relationships with the wider
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:20.760]   family—men, women, boys and girls—so that that's where the child will connect in
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.840]   all the varying ways that he's going to need in order to be as rounded as he
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.120]   should be. That's the second thing. The third is just an expansion of it. The
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.520]   church is where this little boy is going to find or should find strong,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.640]   humble, godly men in action. Here's where the men should emerge into your life,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.400]   Anna, besides any family members you have. Maybe your father could be
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.560]   involved, or uncles or cousins, but the church is really crucial in his
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:07.160]   upbringing because your son is going to need to have mature, healthy, godly men
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.960]   around him. And you want him to grow up not just to be a kind of freewheeling
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.160]   man, but a godly churchman, a lover of the people of God, the church. And the
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.320]   fourth thing to say is, to be sure, marriage is more than the creation of
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:34.240]   parents. Marriage is more than providing masculine and feminine role models. So
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   you should not marry merely out of a sense of hope that your son will get an
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.360]   example of manhood. It's more than that, and you're going to need more than that
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.960]   out of it for it to be what it ought to be. But I would encourage you, and this
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.680]   may stretch, I would encourage you to ask, that is pray, ask the Lord for a
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.760]   heart for marriage. You say you're not called to marriage. That means there's no
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.000]   burning desire for it, no sense of desperation or need for it, and that's
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:19.720]   fine. But I would ask that you seek the Lord for a natural, not desperate, but
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:27.840]   natural emerging heart for marriage and an opportunity for marriage, and that the
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.080]   heart and the opportunity come together, lest there be frustration. The reason I
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:42.960]   say this is that even though I would not call marriage an obligation, I would say
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:52.360]   it is doubly natural in your case. Natural first, because marriage is the
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.840]   ordinary pattern that God set up in the world. It is not good for man to be alone.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   And I think he would say the same thing about the woman. It's not good for the
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:10.280]   woman to be alone unless various circumstances make it so. So first,
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.280]   natural because that's the way he set up ordinary relationships. The second thing
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.600]   that makes it natural is that it's natural for children to have two parents,
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.120]   even though this is not possible in many cases today. So it seems right to me that
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.720]   you would pray something like this. This would be my sample prayer for you if I
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:42.920]   were you. "Lord, I don't feel any need for marriage in myself. I don't have any
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:49.960]   passion for it, but I see it in your Word as natural for men and women. I see it as
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.760]   good for children and as a beautiful testimony to Christ's covenant with His
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:03.240]   church, to the world, a testimony to the world like that. So I am open to your
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:09.620]   working in me and in my relationships to bring this about. If this is what you
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:17.160]   want for me, would you give me a heart for it and bring the man into my life
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:25.400]   with whom I could fully, joyfully serve you and raise my son?" That's my prayer.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.560]   I think it is possible, Anna, to pray that, pray like that, and not fall into the
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:39.320]   trap of being so preoccupied with what might be that you're unable to live the
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.640]   happy, fulfilled life that you can live without that. So you see the tension.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:54.400]   The Lord is able to give you contentment both in singleness and give you
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.480]   the ability to seek the heart for marriage and the possibility of a
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.360]   partner in life and a father for your son. Both are possible. So my
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:11.600]   closing promise would simply be 2 Corinthians 9, 8, "God is able to make all
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.560]   grace abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:23.520]   you may abound in every good work." And that would be the good work of being a
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.800]   single mom or the good work of being a wife. That's a beautifully balanced word,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.120]   Pastor John. Thank you. And Anna, that is an excellent question, well-worded. Thank
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.320]   you for sending that in to us. And I appreciate you listening to this podcast.

[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:58.040]   Well, it is a perennial question. It's an important one.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.360]   Do all religious paths lead to God eventually? Why or why not? And how do we
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.260]   know from Scripture? I'll ask John Piper that next time. I'm your host Tony
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.920]   Reike. We'll see you on Friday.
