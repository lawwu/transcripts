[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Unfortunately the early part of this lecture on the doctrine of the Holy
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.440]   Spirit by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is missing and we hope that it will not
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.360]   spoil your understanding of this study. We join the doctor as he is discussing
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.240]   an apparent contradiction in the scriptural teaching on the coming of the
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240]   Holy Spirit.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.080]   There is of course no conflict but if you read it superficially and personally
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.560]   you might very well have come to the conclusion that there was a conflict and
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.480]   that arises in this way. There are numbers of statements and we enumerated
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.840]   them last week which point forward to Pentecost, prophesy Pentecost, say that
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.280]   certain things could not happen because Pentecost had not yet come and so on.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.600]   There seem to be statements in other words which would give the impression to
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.280]   a superficial reader that the Holy Spirit had only come into this world on
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   the day of Pentecost as recorded in the second chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.320]   of the Apostles. But then I indicated on the other hand there is considerable
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.440]   biblical teaching which shows us the activity and the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.720]   long before the day of Pentecost had ever come. Now we began to consider that
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.320]   second bit of evidence last Friday night and I would remind you that these were
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.040]   the things we've considered. We considered first of all the Old Testament
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.320]   prophecies which were pointing forward to this which in turn
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.200]   reminded us of this that the Holy Spirit was operative at creation. The second
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.440]   verse in the Bible for instance, the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   waters. Secondly we pointed out that it is the Holy Spirit that sustains the
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.600]   universe including the life of men. And thirdly we dealt with what is commonly
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.480]   called common grace and our emphasis was upon this fact that it is the Holy
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.720]   Spirit that does the work of common grace. All natural good in men, natural
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.800]   morality, the conscience, the light that lighteth every man, culture, government,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.560]   and all these things, these are all the result of the work and the activity of
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   the Holy Spirit. Well now those are the three bits of evidence we've already
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.040]   adduced to show that the Holy Spirit had been acting and had been operative in
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.440]   this world before the day of Pentecost. But let me give you further evidence. The
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.000]   fourth bit of evidence is this, that there is plain scriptural teaching to
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.960]   the effect that the Holy Spirit has given special gifts to certain men. Take
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   for instance a man like Samson. Samson was a man of unusual strength and
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.440]   physical vigor and power. Now that strength we are told was given to
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:26.720]   Samson by the Holy Spirit and it was because he hadn't realized that the Lord
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.240]   or the Spirit had left him after his hair had been shaved that Samson was
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.560]   finally captured and overpowered by his enemies the Philistines. But it was the
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.840]   Holy Spirit that gave Samson this remarkable power. Then you remember
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.960]   there's a very interesting incident in the life of Moses where Moses complained
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.640]   that the work was too much for him. And we are told in Numbers 11 17 that God
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.800]   said to Moses, "I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   them, namely the seventy elders who are going to share the work with Moses." Now
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.440]   that's a very striking thing. The Spirit it was that had enabled Moses to do the
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.480]   work. Some of that Spirit is now taken and put upon the seventy elders in order
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.880]   that they may assist Moses in the carrying out of this work. And then you'll
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.040]   find that there was a man called Bezalel who had certain abilities in certain
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   works in connection with the building of the tabernacle. You'll read about him in
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.480]   Exodus 31. It was the Holy Spirit that gave him his particular propensities and
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.240]   powers to do the work that he had to do in connection with the building of the
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.160]   tabernacle and furnishing of it. And the same thing of course is true of Joshua.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.120]   Joshua's military strategy and ability was the result of the operation of the
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.400]   Holy Spirit upon him. Now I simply take those out at random to illustrate this
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.560]   point that way back there in the old dispensation, the Holy Spirit came upon
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.800]   these men and gave them these particular powers. Very well, let's go on to the
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:25.400]   fifth bit of evidence. And here we have to deal with the whole gift of prophecy.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.880]   It is the teaching of the Scripture everywhere that prophecy is made
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.880]   possible by the activity of the Holy Spirit in men. The first instance of this
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.840]   is the case of two men called Eldad and Medad. You'll read about them in Numbers 11,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.760]   verse 29. These two men, Eldad and Medad, began to prophesy and some of the
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.080]   people became rather jealous for Moses' reputation and led Moses to make one of
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.360]   the greatest statements he ever made. He said, "Would God that all the Lord's
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.160]   people were prophets and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them." Moses
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.880]   recognized that Eldad and Medad were able to prophesy because God had put his
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.040]   Spirit upon them. And he said to his supporters, "Don't be jealous for my sake.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.040]   I would that all the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord had put his
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.480]   Spirit upon all of them." Well, they were prophets. And the same thing is true of
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.920]   course even of a hireling prophet like Balaam. Balaam was enabled to say and had
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.000]   to say what he said because the Spirit of God was upon him. Indeed, you remember
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.840]   that Saul, the first king of Israel, that the Spirit came upon him. And the
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   statement was uttered, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" That was because Saul,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.440]   under the influence and the power of the Holy Spirit, had been prophesying. And
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.200]   then, of course, it's obviously true of all the prophets, the prophets whose
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.560]   works we have recorded in the Old Testament canon. Indeed, we have gone
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.600]   further when we were dealing with the doctrine of Scripture. Our teaching was
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.120]   and is that all the writers of the Scriptures of the Old Testament and the
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.080]   New were all under the influence and the power of the Holy Spirit. These holy men
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.800]   of God speak, that's referring to the prophets especially, as they were moved
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.240]   by the Holy Spirit. But all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, all
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.880]   Scripture. We believe that all the writers of the Old Testament were under
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.520]   the power and the influence of the Holy Spirit. So it's good to include that
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.880]   under this particular heading of prophecy. Therefore, that's
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.080]   another very powerful argument for showing that way back long before the
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.560]   day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit had been coming upon these men and enabling
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.800]   them to act in that way. But for the sixth bit of evidence, I refer you to
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.400]   something that seems to take us even further. Because you remember a statement
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.680]   made by David in the 51st Psalm, in the 13th verse, David says, "Take not thy
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.040]   Holy Spirit from me." Now here's a man under the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:33.920]   Here's a man before Pentecost. He says, "Take not thy Holy Spirit from me." He
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   realized what that would mean. So he prays that God would not take his spirit
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.800]   from him. And what is true of David is, of course, equally true of all the Old
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.500]   Testament believers. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the same applies to them as to
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.580]   David. All these Old Testament saints were believers. They are citizens of the
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.860]   kingdom of God. And obviously you cannot be a believer nor a citizen of the
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.560]   kingdom of God without the Holy Spirit. But there is a striking statement which
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:17.480]   focuses attention upon this matter. "Take not thy Holy Spirit from me," says an Old
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.920]   Testament saint. But now coming on to the New Testament, and I'm taking it as you
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:31.740]   can see in a chronological order, we come to the case of John the Baptist. And the
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.160]   statement that the angel made to Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.720]   in the first chapter of Luke, in the 15th verse, was this, "And he shall be filled
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:50.880]   with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb." In this connection, a very
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.720]   important statement, "He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:04.200]   mother's womb." And so it was. But remember, there is a statement to the effect that
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.600]   among them that are born of women, there is not risen a greater than John the
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.800]   Baptist, notwithstanding, he that is the least in the kingdom of heaven is
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.840]   greater than he. Yet we are told of John that he should be filled with the Holy
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:25.440]   Ghost even from his mother's womb. But we've got a statement like this about
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   his mother, Elizabeth. In Luke 141 we read this, "And Elizabeth was filled with
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.560]   the Holy Ghost." Now this is all before Pentecost, remember. And let us test any
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.440]   theory we may have had about Pentecost by a statement like that, "Elizabeth was
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:52.480]   filled with the Holy Ghost." Then we are told about Zacharias. Are we not the same
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.280]   thing in the 67th verse of that first chapter of Luke? "And his father,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:07.960]   Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied." Then follows the
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.040]   account of what he said. But here it is, Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.480]   and prophesied. Indeed, we've got this statement like that about Simeon. That
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:27.120]   old man, you remember, who held the infant Lord Jesus in his arms. In Luke 2 25 I
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:35.320]   read, "And the Holy Ghost was upon him." In verse 26 I'm told, "It was revealed unto
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:44.200]   him by the Holy Ghost." And in verse 27, "And he came by the Spirit into the
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   temple." All that again about a man well before the day of Pentecost. And then as
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.480]   you read the Gospels about the various disciples sent out by the Lord to
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.880]   preach and to cast out devils, you realize that they were enabled to do all
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.920]   that they did by means of the Holy Spirit. Their ability to preach, their
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:14.400]   ability to exorcise devils, it was all power given to them by the Lord through
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   the Holy Spirit. So that everything they did, they did by and in and through the
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.760]   power of the Spirit. And then there is the final statement, which is such an
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:35.440]   important one as you're considering this doctrine of Pentecost. John 20 22. "Where
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.240]   our Lord, you remember, appeared suddenly in that upper room to the disciples. The
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.440]   doors were all shut, but suddenly appeared amongst them. And eventually we are told
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:55.280]   this, when he had said this, he breathed on them and saith unto them, 'Receive ye
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:03.120]   the Holy Ghost.'" Well now, there is the evidence. You see, the previous evidence
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:09.560]   was all to this effect, wasn't it? That the day of Pentecost had not yet come,
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:16.280]   the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified. And our
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.000]   Lord says, "It is expedient for you that I go away, because if I go not away, the
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.080]   Comforter will not come unto you," and so on. And then his injunction to them, to
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:33.440]   Terry at Jerusalem, "Behold, I send the promise of the Father upon you, and ye
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.000]   shall be endued with power from on high." And he commanded them that they should
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.280]   not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:51.400]   ye have heard of me." Now there is the problem by which we seem to be confronted.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:57.280]   Statements which imply that he hadn't come. Statements which teach plainly and
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.280]   clearly that he was active and operative, and that mighty things were happening in
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.520]   him and through him. Now the problem confronting us is how to reconcile these
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:13.960]   things together. Obviously there's no contradiction here, and there must be
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:21.640]   some way of understanding these two series of statements. Well now, let's try
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.640]   to approach a solution by putting it in this manner. There are certain things
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:34.320]   which seem to me to be abundantly plain and clear. Here's the first. That the
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.720]   coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ into this world made a vital
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.120]   difference in this whole question of the work and the operation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:55.480]   Indeed we must go further. That his death and his ascension made a still more
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.520]   vital difference. You read about the Holy Spirit and his work in this way, but you
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.680]   notice the moment you come to the New Testament, the moment the coming of the
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.640]   Lord begins to be talked about, there seems to be something new and something
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.200]   special and something additional. And then he himself goes on saying, "Yes, but
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.160]   there's going to be more." The prophecy of John, "He shall baptize you with the Holy
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:27.680]   Ghost and with fire," and his own statements. So that we notice that the
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:34.840]   death and especially the resurrection of our Lord and his ascension make and mark
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.720]   a vital difference and turning point in this whole doctrine of the work and the
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   operation of the Holy Spirit. The second thing we notice is this, that in the
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.560]   prophecy of Joel in that second chapter, which was quoted, if you remember, by
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.960]   Peter in his sermon on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, the emphasis is
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.680]   placed upon the word, "Pour out." "It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God,
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:13.160]   I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh." Now that is surely significant. The
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.600]   emphasis is upon the extent. It's going to be more general. Also, there is an
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.960]   emphasis upon the fact that it's going to be upon all types and kinds, your sons
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.920]   and your daughters, your young men, your old men, even your servants and your
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:35.400]   handmaidens, on all these I will pour out in those days of my Spirit and they
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.340]   shall prophesy. Now in the Old Testament it was something exceptional, it was
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:47.640]   something unusual, and these people on whom the Spirit came were exceptional
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:54.680]   persons. But the emphasis here is upon the generality, upon this whole idea of
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:03.200]   pouring out, the largeness and the freeness and the fullness of the gift.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.600]   Not only that, there is an emphasis upon a further fact, which is that it's no
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.520]   longer going to be confined to the Jews. You will find that actually in the
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.640]   prophecy of Joel at the end of that second chapter. And then, of course, you
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.360]   find it worked out still more fully when you come to the book of the Acts of
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:29.520]   the Apostles. No longer confined to the Jews, but upon all nations. There is this
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:37.480]   largeness and this freeness. He will pour out his Spirit upon all flesh. There is
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:44.200]   an all-inclusiveness, which we must note. Well, we notice those bits of evidence
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.480]   which are perfectly clear and plain, but there is one other to which I must
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:54.360]   advert. And that is a word that's spoken by our Lord himself. You'll find it in
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:03.440]   John 14 verse 17. Referring to the Holy Spirit, he says, "He dwelleth with you and
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:10.320]   shall be in you." Now, there is a distinction there made by our Lord
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.080]   himself, which obviously must be of very vital importance. "He dwelleth with you," he
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   says. And there had been proof of that, of course, in the works that they'd been
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   enabled to do. But he says, "He dwelleth with you and shall be in you." It's this
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   prophecy of his with regard to what would happen after the day of Pentecost.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   And in order to make our evidence still more complete, and in order that we may
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:46.560]   now come to a suggested synthesis of these two groups of statements, I must
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.880]   call your attention to those three incidents, the accounts of which we have
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:58.320]   read together just now. What happened in the house of Cornelius, as it is recorded
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.040]   in the tenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, that's one of
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:11.680]   them. And also what happened in Samaria, which is recorded in the eighth chapter
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.120]   of the book of the Acts, and what happened at Ephesus, as recorded in the
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.500]   nineteenth chapter. Now, I shall come back in a moment to show
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.960]   the difference between what happened in the tenth of Acts and what happened in
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.280]   the eighth and the nineteenth. I am going to take the eighth and the nineteenth
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.000]   together, the tenth I put in a category on its own, but at the moment I am
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.400]   taking the three together for this reason, that there is one factor which is
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:51.760]   common to the three, and that is that the element of unity is emphasized in them
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.160]   in exactly the same way as it is emphasized in the second chapter of the
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.520]   book of Acts, where we have the record of the events of the day of Pentecost.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.840]   Now that is the big thing in the second chapter, isn't it? You see, here are
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.960]   these different people up at the feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem. They had come,
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   they were Parthians and Medes and Elamites and dwellers in Mesopotamia,
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:22.240]   Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya, Cyrene,
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:27.960]   the fringes of Rome, Jews and Prophets, Cretes and Arabians, all these different
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:34.240]   nationalities, these different tongues and languages, they all, we hear them
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:42.920]   speak in our tongues, the wonderful works of God. Now that is the thing that
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:50.000]   obviously stands out, this amazing oneness, this extraordinary unity. And of
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.120]   course the same unity was being displayed in the very Apostles themselves.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:02.040]   There is a coming together and a growing together, and you find the same thing in
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.840]   what happened in Samaria, you find it happening to the Gentiles in the case of
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.520]   Cornelius and his household, you find it happening to these believers who were
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.840]   there at Ephesus. Now surely it is there that we find the key to the solution of
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:27.240]   this problem. Surely what was happening there when the Holy Ghost descended on
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.280]   the day of Pentecost, when the Lord Jesus Christ baptized with the Holy Ghost as
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:39.920]   he said he would do, surely what was happening was this. It was the formation
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:49.840]   of the Church as the body of Christ. Now before this there were believers. The
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.880]   Apostles were obviously believers before the day of Pentecost. You mustn't regard
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.200]   the Apostles as unbelievers until the day of Pentecost. We know perfectly well
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.560]   that they were believers even before our Lord's death. Imperfect and unclear in
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.720]   many respects, but nevertheless they were his believers. And then when he appeared
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.360]   to them they were certainly believers. And you remember he breathed upon them
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." If you don't believe that they were
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.880]   believers before that, they must have been believers then. But you see that was
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.400]   before the day of Pentecost. So what happened on the day of Pentecost was not
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:33.240]   that they became believers. Well what was it? Well I'm suggesting that it was this,
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:40.160]   that it was the believers being welded together as members of the one body of
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.760]   Christ. If you like, in a sense before that they were separate and discrete
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.840]   believers, even as the believers in the Old Testament were believers and were
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.760]   citizens of the kingdom, Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, and David, and the Patriarchs, etc.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:04.000]   But they were not members of the body of Christ. Here the primary thing was that
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.380]   all these became one. And it does seem to me that this is something which we can
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:17.920]   understand if we only approach it in this way. This you see was something that
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:26.520]   could only happen after our Lord's ascension. While he was here in the flesh
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:35.080]   and teaching them, the church as his body was not yet formed. We read a statement,
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.760]   do we not, in the book of the Acts of the Apostles that he has purchased the
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:46.440]   church by his blood. The church in that sense could not have existed before our
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.760]   Lord had completed the work which he had come to do. And he only completes that
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   work as he ascends into the presence of the Father. But the moment he does that
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.080]   he has completed the work which was necessary for the purchase of the church,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.320]   and he is made the head of the church, and as the head of the church the Holy
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:14.640]   Spirit is given to him that he might give it to the church which is his body.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.840]   Now the point I am emphasizing is that all that could not have happened before
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:27.440]   the ascension, but that you would expect it to happen after the ascension. And
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.120]   that is precisely what happened. Ten days after the ascension, our Lord who is
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.280]   now the head of the church, the head of the body which is the church, sends his
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:46.080]   spirit into and upon and to fill the body. It is the gift that he gives. The
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.200]   promise of the Father is now sent by the Son who has completed the work that was
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:57.000]   necessary in order that it might happen. So that what you have really on the day
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.560]   of Pentecost is the church established as one unity as the body of Christ.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.680]   Now let me give you a verse which will explain all this. It is in 1 Corinthians
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:22.560]   12 chapter 13 verse. This is how the Apostle puts it, "For by one spirit are we
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:30.840]   all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:39.560]   free, and have all been made to drink into one spirit." Now there it is. By one
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:46.320]   spirit, the Holy Spirit, we are all baptized into one body. That's the thing.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.840]   And what happened on the day of Pentecost was that all these believers
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:57.960]   were baptized into one body. All these, the Apostles and then the 3,000 that
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.840]   believed their preaching, and later in the house of Cornelius, the Gentiles. Jew
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.960]   and Gentile and all these other people from different parts of the world, all
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:14.880]   baptized into one body. The church is one. There is only one church. This invisible
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.960]   church, the mystical body of Christ. There is that essential and permanent,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.760]   permanent unity in the body. That's where the division between the visible and the
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.600]   invisible church becomes important. But the thing I'm emphasizing is that there
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.760]   is a unity in the church which is the body of Christ. And that unity was brought
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:43.080]   into being when all these persons were baptized into the one body on the day of
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.520]   Pentecost. All right, let me put it in different language. You can say, if you
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.800]   like, that the day of Pentecost was the day of the public inauguration of the
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.920]   church as the body of Christ. There was something new there which had never been
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.800]   before. There is a sense in which you can speak of the church in the Old Testament,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:09.440]   yes, but it isn't the same as the church was subsequent to this day of Pentecost.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:14.360]   This unity was established. Then you see the significance of what happened in the
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:23.600]   house of Cornelius and how important that was. Peter, of course, as a Jew, would
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.520]   obviously have found it very difficult to believe that Gentiles could rarely come
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   into this unity. That was why you remember the vision was given to him as
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.280]   he was there on top of the house and he saw that great sheet coming down with
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:44.520]   those animals and beasts upon it. Peter, as a Jew, regarded the Gentiles as
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:51.120]   outsiders. But isn't there a further suggestion that even that vision was not
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.440]   enough? It was enough to take Peter certainly to the house of Cornelius and
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.040]   to preach as he did. But you notice that even while he was yet preaching, the Holy
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:08.120]   Ghost descended upon Cornelius and his household. Peter and the Jews, especially
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:13.600]   we were told, were amazed at this. These people couldn't quite understand it, but
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   they had to face the facts. They heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.560]   They of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.440]   Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:35.400]   Ghost. Not only that, the next chapter tells us that when all this was reported
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.400]   in Jerusalem, that the believers in Jerusalem were a little bit troubled
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:46.560]   about this. And when Peter went up, he was cross-examined about it, when Peter was
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.400]   come up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision contended with him.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:57.280]   And they of the circumcision, remember, means the Jewish Christians. They contended
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:03.600]   with them saying that they went just into men uncircumcised and did eat with them.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.960]   But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:13.920]   them saying. But this is the thing that he emphasized, that while he was yet
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:20.480]   speaking, that the Holy Ghost had descended upon them. As I began to speak,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:28.160]   says Peter in verse 15, the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.360]   Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.720]   with water, but he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. For as much then as God
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:43.320]   gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:49.480]   what was I that I could withstand God? Then when they heard these things, they
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:55.960]   held their peace and glorified God saying, then hath God also to the Gentiles
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:03.440]   regarded repentance unto life. Now you see what was happening. God was there
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.880]   declaring that they were to be baptized into this same body, that the church was
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:15.360]   to consist of Jews and Gentiles, Gentiles and Jews. Now that's the great theme of
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.960]   Paul, isn't it, not in the third chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians. The
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.360]   thing that had been hid from the previous generations, that the Gentiles
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:30.000]   were to be made fellow heirs, that they were to be brought into the kingdom, that
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.760]   they were to be welded, baptized into the body, and that therefore as one body they
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:43.440]   should be there for him to function through them in this world of time. But
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.080]   for me to complete my evidence I have to give you one further scriptural quotation.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:54.880]   And this time it's from the epistle to the Hebrews chapter 11 verses 39 and 40,
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:02.000]   most significant. Listen. You remember the great list and gallery of the heroes of
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.680]   the faith of the Old Testament that you have in that chapter? Well then this
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:14.160]   is what he says. "These all, having obtained the good report through faith,
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   received not the promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:28.560]   they without us should not be made perfect." Oh yes, he says, they were
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:34.320]   believers, but everything wasn't given to them. They were held back, as it were,
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:41.440]   until this should happen so that they and we together should be made perfect.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:48.200]   They were believers, but they had not been baptized into the body of Christ. The
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.480]   church had not yet come into being in this sense, because Christ had not yet
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.400]   ascended. He hadn't done the work. He hadn't returned to the Father. But they
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.440]   were believers, they were being reserved, they were being held, they were being
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.680]   kept, so that when our Lord did ascend, then they were well baptized into the
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:14.520]   body and the church is one, and has remained one ever since. Well now that I
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.120]   suggest to you is the significance of what happened on the day of Pentecost,
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:23.920]   and what happened in the household of Cornelius is comparable to it. It is
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.840]   rarely the same thing, as Peter argues in that chapter 11 of the book of the Acts
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.120]   of the Apostles, and indeed you'll find he had to bring out the same argument in
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:39.800]   the 15th chapter at a great council of the church in Jerusalem. So that, it seems
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.840]   to me, is the real meaning and significance of what happened on the day
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:49.040]   of Pentecost. Now, before we close, there is just one other thing I must do
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:55.400]   tonight. What about that which is recorded in the 8th chapter and the 19th
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.680]   chapter? You notice that I don't put that with what happened in the 10th
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:05.840]   chapter, and I don't for this reason. In the household of Cornelius, this is
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.520]   what took place. Peter's preaching, and just as he begins to preach, the Holy
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:15.880]   Ghost is poured out upon them. But that isn't what happened in Samaria, and that
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:21.280]   isn't what happened in Ephesus with Paul. In Samaria, what happened was this.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.400]   Philip went down and preached and evangelized, and a number of people
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:30.760]   believed and were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. But Peter and
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.880]   John had to go down and pray for them and lay their hands upon them before
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.320]   they received the gift of the Holy Ghost. In the case of Ephesus, Paul visited. He
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.760]   asked these men the question. In the authorized, it reads, "Have you received
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.800]   the Holy Ghost since you believed?" In the revised, "Did you receive the Holy
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.640]   Ghost when you believed?" It doesn't really make any difference. The two
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.760]   things mean the same thing. And these men said, "We have not so much as heard that
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.960]   there be such a thing as the Holy Ghost." In other words, they had received John's
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:09.160]   baptism only. And there, Paul preaches to them and baptizes them in the name of
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.600]   Christ, and then places his hands upon them, and they received the gift of the
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.120]   Holy Ghost. Now, you see that we've got to put these in a different category.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.000]   Because the Holy Spirit was received by these people in a different way. And
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.120]   people have often asked the question, "Why did it happen like that in Samaria, and
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.880]   why did it happen like that in Ephesus? What's the difference between those two
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:41.000]   groups and Cornelius and his household?" Well, I suggest to you it's this. Cornelius
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.080]   and his household were Gentiles. They were not actually proselytes, but they
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.360]   were God-fearing. They were seeking. These other people were in a different
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   position. The Samaritans were an admixture of Jews and of pagans. You will
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   find the history of the founding of that Samaritan country in the Old Testament.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.240]   They were in a sense neither Jews nor Gentiles. They'd got the five books of
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.960]   Moses, but none of the remainder of the Old Testament. They regarded themselves,
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   you see, as being equal to the Jews. You remember the story of the woman of
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.560]   Samaria. Our fathers say that you should worship in this mountain, but you say
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.520]   it's in Jerusalem. There was a great feud between the Jews and the Samaritans for
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.720]   that reason. The Samaritans felt they'd got a perfect religion. The Jews knew
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.920]   that the Samaritan religion was imperfect. Well, now, these people were
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.360]   Samaritans. And it seems to me that that is the key to the understanding of what
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:47.840]   happened. The Holy Spirit did not fall upon them as Philip preached to them.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.680]   Envoys, emissaries, had to be sent down from the church, the headquarters at
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.760]   Jerusalem, to give them the gift of the Holy Spirit. Why? Well, surely to
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:04.520]   establish this fact, that the Samaritans must recognize their allegiance to the
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.640]   church at Jerusalem. And the church at Jerusalem is the logical sequence and
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:16.440]   outcome of the Old Testament faith in its completeness, in its fullness. In
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.560]   other words, the Samaritans have got to recognize that their religion was
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:26.920]   incomplete, and that the Christian church has come out, as it were, of the Jewish
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:33.640]   church, the old church in the Old Testament. That there is a continuity in
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:39.040]   God's way of salvation. That you have to accept the whole of the teaching of the
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.400]   Old Testament if you are to be truly Christian. You can't suddenly come in
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.280]   into the New Testament, as it were. You can't come in by some other way into the
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:55.400]   kingdom. No, this is God's way. So the Samaritans have to submit themselves to
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:01.480]   all this teaching, and to the church at Jerusalem, which was first of all a
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:08.880]   Jewish church, to the Jew first, then to the Gentiles. They have to recognize
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.920]   and submit to all that, and then they are given the gift of the Spirit. Now in the
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:20.880]   same way, the people at Ephesus, these, you see, had got a religion which was
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.160]   all right as far as it went. They were disciples of John, and had been baptized
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:33.760]   into the name of John. But they were not clear about the gospel. So that in their
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.400]   case again, this has to be put clear. It has to be made straight. In the case of
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:46.800]   the Gentiles, like Cornelius, there was no error to correct. They had nothing. So as
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:53.240]   Peter preaches, the Holy Ghost descends. But in these other cases,
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:58.480]   there was an incomplete religion, an imperfect understanding. That has to be
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.280]   put right before the gift of the Holy Spirit is given. And that seems to me to
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:10.440]   be a very important and a very vital distinction. And I trust that I've made
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:17.760]   my exposition of it plain and clear to you. In the case of Cornelius and his
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.520]   household, God was simply making this great demonstration to the effect that
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:27.280]   the Gentiles are to come in and to be baptized into the body. In these other
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:33.000]   cases, that wasn't necessary. But what is necessary in their case is that they
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.240]   should believe the truth clearly, and get rid of certain prejudices and false
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.520]   ideas which they had before that. In other words, then, we sum it up by saying
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:49.560]   that the great object of Pentecost is to give the final proof of the fact that
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:56.320]   Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. That is
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:02.760]   declared. The second thing is this great inauguration of the church as his body.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:11.160]   And thirdly, it is a proof of the fact that these various people who are added
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:17.000]   to the church are really members of the body. In addition to that, there are
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.760]   various other things which we shall have to come to later. The main one is this. In
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:29.080]   the Old Testament we are told that the Holy Spirit was with the men, or that he
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:36.720]   came upon them. He worked upon them from without, as it were. And what David even
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.800]   said, you remember, was, "Take not thy Holy Spirit from me," as if the Holy Spirit was
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:47.640]   with him. That is the Old Testament terminology. The New Testament terminology
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:56.880]   is "in," "within." And he works from within, and he abides. In the Old Testament, he came
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:02.680]   upon men and left them. He comes in the New Testament now because we are members of
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.640]   the body, and he abides within us. Because we are all parts of the body, and
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.120]   members of the body of Christ, and because the Spirit is in him in its
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:17.280]   fullness, and comes from him through the whole body, the Holy Spirit abides in us.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.840]   As members of the body, the Spirit abides in us perfectly.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:31.080]   Now that is, it seems to me, the essence of the teaching with regard to this matter.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:38.200]   Confusion has often arisen because, in addition to all this, these people on the
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.840]   day of Pentecost were at the same time filled with the Spirit. And as the result
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.840]   of the filling with the Spirit, were able to witness. But you notice that that was
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:54.200]   repeated several times. And indeed, I hope to come back to the teaching
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   concerning the filling with the Holy Spirit at a later point. That must
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:06.160]   obviously come after justification and sanctification. But I just mention it at
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.200]   this point. There is confusion often because of the very term "filling." They
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.080]   were filled with the Spirit, but they were repeatedly filled with the Spirit,
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.960]   and were unable to witness with boldness because they were filled with the
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:25.280]   Spirit. But that is not the special thing about what happened on the day of
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:34.880]   Pentecost. The special thing, emphasized by the rushing mighty wind, emphasized
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:41.800]   by the cloven tongues of fire, which was never repeated again, that is all meant
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:48.960]   to emphasize this baptizing into the unity of the body, the inauguration of the
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:57.520]   Church. So you have the special phenomenon. The cloven tongues of fire, I say, was
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:04.260]   never repeated again. The walls were shaken on another occasion, but this
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:11.000]   peculiar sound, this noise, the gathering together of these special phenomena
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.760]   places a uniqueness upon the event on the day of Pentecost which has never been
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.640]   repeated again. And in a sense, it was never necessary to repeat it again,
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:27.480]   because this is something once and for all. But the filling with the Spirit is
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.400]   something which can and is often repeated. But we must think of that as
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:38.520]   something which is not the vital thing which happened at the day of Pentecost.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:44.640]   What happened there was this thing that could only happen when our Lord had
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.680]   finished the work for his people and rises and becomes the head of the Church,
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:55.880]   the Church becomes his body, and the Spirit is given to fill the body. That's
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:02.000]   the thing that is emphasized at Pentecost. Well, having dealt with that, we
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.360]   shall now be in a position to go on to consider in detail the work of the Holy
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:15.360]   Spirit as he comes to deal with and to apply the work of redemption completed
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.560]   by our Lord and Savior. Let us pray.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.640]   We come thus to thee, our Heavenly Father, and we would again thank thee for thy
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:34.480]   Holy Spirit and for thy Word. O God, we pray thee to enable us to understand
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:41.000]   these things more and more clearly. Help us to learn the personal lessons that
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.360]   come to us as the result of the things that we have been considering. Help us
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.880]   all to know that we have been baptized into that body, that we are indeed
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:58.040]   members of the body of Christ. Ye are the body of Christ and members in
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:04.120]   particular. O God, give us grace ever to remember this fact, that wherever we
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:10.140]   are, whatever may be happening to us, whatever we may do, that we are members
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:17.680]   of his body. O God, help us to know that and to remember it and to realize it
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:23.120]   and to know that thy Spirit abides in us, that our very bodies are the temples
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:30.560]   of the Holy Ghost who is in us and who remains in us. Lord, give us this
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:38.040]   ability and grace to apply these wondrous truths to ourselves and our
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.920]   experiences day by day. Now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:50.360]   love of God and the fellowship in the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:57.040]   continue with us now this night and evermore. Amen.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
