[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   We apologise for the crackling that can be heard in certain parts of the following recording.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.400]   This was due to a fault on the machine that was used to record the original tape and unfortunately
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.420]   is beyond repair. However, we do hope that this will not spoil your enjoyment of this
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.920]   message by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:38.920]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:50.680]   the Gospel according to St Matthew in chapter 16 and verse 26. The 26th verse in the 16th
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:00.920]   chapter of the Gospel according to St Matthew. For what is a man profited if he shall gain
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:10.320]   the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:25.520]   soul? What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.840]   Surely there is no more important question that we can ever face than that particular
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:43.120]   question. If we had no other reason for saying that, this one reason would be sufficient,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:52.640]   that the person who asked the question is the most important person that has ever been
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.560]   in this world. You can assess the value of questions in many ways. You can assess them
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.680]   in terms of the subject concerning which they put themselves. And that in and of itself
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:16.040]   is a very useful and important classification. And in this case you see at once that if that
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.200]   is your criterion or your standard, you have to agree that there is no more important question
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.760]   than this question. But there is another way of assessing the
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.240]   value and the importance of a question, and it is, as I say, to consider the person who
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.920]   puts the question. The greater the man, the greater the person asking the question, the
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.320]   greater significance does that question of necessity have for us. There are people who
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.160]   ask foolish questions, irrelevant questions, unimportant questions. But we say that we
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.400]   pay no attention to them, that anything that may be said by such people is not worthy of
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   attention. They ask foolish questions, and because they are foolish people, we pay no
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:14.120]   attention to their questions. But here is a question that is asked by someone of whom
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:23.440]   we can say that he is the most important person that has ever entered into or lived in this
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.040]   world. Now it's very interesting to notice, isn't
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.120]   it? When exactly our Lord put this question? He put it, you remember, immediately after
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.160]   that very important and vital incident in connection with his life and ministry, which
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:48.560]   took place at Caesarea Philippi, when he turned to his disciples and put that important question
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:59.560]   asking, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?" And Simon Peter made his immortal
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:12.720]   statement when he said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And our Lord accepts
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.320]   the answer and commends Peter, you remember, saying, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah,
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:28.000]   for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.120]   Very well then I say, here is a question put to us by one who accepts the designation that
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:47.520]   he is the Christ, the Son of the living God. And in this context, where he has just declared
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.080]   himself, he puts this momentous question, "What is a man profitable if he shall gain
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:08.680]   the whole world and lose his own soul?" Now then let us try to look at this great question.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.640]   By putting this question, our Lord tells us quite a number of things. And we can subdivide
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.800]   those things, if you like, into general statements and more particular statements. Here are some
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.240]   of the general statements which he makes. The first is he makes the pronouncement that
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:38.640]   every man has a soul. What shall it, what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:48.480]   world and lose his own soul? I say, therefore, that the deduction is that every one of us
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:56.760]   has a soul. He is making that statement by asking his question. And what is the soul?
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:06.040]   Well, the soul is that which differentiates a man from an animal. A soul is that which
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:15.200]   is within us, every one of us who is a human being, which links us to God and makes us
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:23.560]   capable of fellowship with God. The soul is that part of man which reaches out, not to
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.520]   the seen and the visible that is round and about him, but rather to the unseen, the invisible,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:37.840]   the eternal, and especially, I say, to God. The soul is something immaterial. You can
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.320]   dissect a human body and you can't find it. No, but the soul is that which has been placed
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   in man by God and which separates him, essentially, from all the animals. In many respects, man
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.920]   is similar to the animals. In many respects, in his physical constitution, he is remarkably
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:06.800]   similar to the animal. But when you come to this question of the soul, here is something
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.840]   that the animal lacks and belongs only to man. It is this strange power and capacity
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:23.360]   that man has of realizing something of his own individuality and personality. It is this
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:32.080]   within him which renders him capable of fellowship and communion with God. It is this which therefore
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.720]   opens him and exposes him to the blessings that God gives in this peculiar manner to
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:47.200]   the human race. Now, that is what is meant by the soul. And therefore, what our Lord
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.920]   is saying here is this, that every one of us possesses this soul.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.720]   God made man in his own image. This is a great mystery, but it includes what I'm talking
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:06.280]   about. He put this peculiar something into man which he put into nobody else. And thus,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:14.040]   man was made in the image and the likeness of God. He became a living soul with all the
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:21.180]   possibility of the enjoyment of God, and the knowledge of God, and the peculiar blessings
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:28.280]   that God gives alone to man. Very well, there is our first statement. Every one of us possesses
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:37.480]   a soul. But then our Lord goes on to make a second statement, which is this. This soul
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:48.520]   which we all have may be lost, or it may be in a saved condition. Clearly, his question
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.040]   carries that implication, doesn't it? He says, "What is a man profited if he shall gain the
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:00.480]   whole world and lose his own soul?" Very well then, the soul is something that we can lose.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:08.980]   A man's soul may be lost, or a man's soul may not be lost. Here is his second proposition.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.280]   We've all been given the gift of the soul. Yes, but the question is, what is the condition
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.360]   of our soul? Is it in a saved condition? Is it in a lost condition? And clearly, what
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:27.280]   determines that is its awareness of God and its relationship to God. The living soul,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.760]   the saved soul, is a soul that is functioning as God meant it to do. And a soul which doesn't
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:41.440]   function in that way is a soul that is lost. So, our Lord emphasizes this momentous and
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   tremendous truth, that a man's soul may be lost, or it may be in a saved condition. And
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:59.960]   then he goes on to say this, that we shall all be judged finally in terms of the condition
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.400]   of our soul. Did you notice how he went on to say that? He said the Son of Man shall
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:14.360]   come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he shall reward every man according
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:22.240]   to his works. He, the speaker, the Son of Man, the Christ, the Son of the living God,
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.200]   is going to come back, he says, and is going to be surrounded by his holy angels, and he
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:36.120]   is going to judge every man. And the subject of the judgment will be the soul. This very
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.320]   thing about which he's speaking. The question confronting every one of us then will be,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:48.000]   is your soul lost, or is your soul as it was meant to be? What is the condition of your
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:58.040]   soul? He says that. And then he says another thing, and it follows, of course, in its own
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:09.240]   logical sequence from all that I've been saying. Our eternal destiny will depend upon
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:18.480]   the state and the condition of our soul when we stand before him in the judgment.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:25.360]   Now that is something that our Lord was constantly saying. There is a division, a final division
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:33.280]   of the saved and the lost. And those who are saved go on to eternal and everlasting glory,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:40.440]   and those who have lost the soul go on into eternal and everlasting misery. Well, now
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.240]   then, here you see are some of the general statements which our Lord makes and implies
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:52.440]   by this momentous question and by the surrounding context. Here is, as it were, how he introduces
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.360]   the subject to us. It's no use saying or asking us a question of what is a man profited if
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.200]   he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul, unless we've got some notion and
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.480]   idea as to what is meant by the soul, and that is what is meant by it.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.880]   Now every one of us in this congregation has got a soul, and the state of the soul of every
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:21.320]   one of us is either that it's saved or else it's lost. You and I, every one of us, shall
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.040]   have to stand in the judgment on this very question as to the condition, the state of
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   our soul, and our eternal destiny without end will be decided by this one question of
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:48.000]   the state or the condition of our soul. Very well, there is our Lord's introduction, if
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.200]   you like, to the question that he puts. But fortunately for us, he didn't leave it at
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:02.840]   that. And he says things here in this context, in this paragraph, which will help to enlighten
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:10.040]   us, and which will help us to know exactly what the condition of our soul is. And this,
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:15.320]   I say again, is surely the most momentous question that can ever face a human being.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.800]   Very well, then, let us come on to his particular statements.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.360]   Certainly the first thing we should desire to know in the light of what I've just been
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:35.520]   saying is this. How may I know the condition of my soul? How may I know whether my soul
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.120]   is lost or is not? You see the issues that depend upon it. What shall it profit a man
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.040]   though he gained the whole world and lose his own soul? Here is this whole question
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:56.320]   of my eternal destiny, my future without end. It all depends upon whether my soul is
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.480]   lost or not. Therefore, I say, the first thing I want to know is this. What are the conditions
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:09.760]   or the indications, if you like, of the fact that a man's soul is lost? How may I know
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.240]   whether my soul is lost or whether it's saved? Well, fortunately, the answer is given
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:26.480]   quite plainly here. Now, the first thing that our Lord tells us about this matter is this,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:34.440]   that the ultimate way to discover whether our soul is lost or not is to discover how
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:44.040]   we think. What is our thinking? What is our thought life like? Now, let me show you where
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:53.000]   I find that here. The first thing that indicates whether a man's soul is lost or not is the
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.200]   very type of thinking in which he indulges. Because, according to the Bible, there are
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:08.680]   two main ways in which men may think, and in fact, two ways in which men do think. There
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:14.600]   is what you may call a natural way of thinking, the way of thinking which is characteristic
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.800]   of the world and everybody who belongs to the world, but there is, on the other hand,
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:27.520]   another type of thinking which can be called a spiritual way of thinking, which is altogether
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.280]   different. Now, our Lord, you notice, puts this quite
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.480]   plainly in a statement that he made to Peter. "Here is our Lord, he has asked his question,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   'Whom do men say that I am?' and then to the disciples, 'Whom do ye say that I am?'
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.920]   And Peter brings out his great answer, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.'"
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.680]   Yes, but in a few moments, listen, "Our Lord began to show unto his disciples how that
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.640]   he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and chief priests, and
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:08.880]   scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. Then Peter, this Peter of all
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.840]   people, took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, 'Be it far from thee, Lord; this shall
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:23.520]   not be unto thee.' And then I read this, 'But he turned, and said unto Peter, 'Get thee
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:32.560]   behind me, Satan; thou art an offence unto me, for thou savourest not the things that
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:39.400]   be of God, but the things that be of men.'" What does that mean? Well, what our Lord was
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.920]   virtually saying to Peter was this, "Peter, in spite of the fact that you made that wonderful
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:51.640]   statement just now, your whole thinking is wrong, man." You see, when our Lord went on
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.360]   to tell the disciples that he was going to die upon the cross and lay down his life as
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:02.060]   sacrifice for many, Peter said, "This shan't happen to you. This is wrong. This is impossible."
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:07.120]   He upbraided him. He remonstrated with him. And our Lord said, "Get behind me, Satan.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.600]   You don't mind. You're not thinking the things that belong to God. You're thinking the things
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.560]   that belong to man, and you're a hindrance to me."
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.880]   Now, there is an indication of what I mean, but let me give you another illustration.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   You remember what our Lord said to Simon Peter after he'd made his great confession? This
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:38.480]   is how I read. "He turned to him and said, 'Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:50.320]   and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.'" What
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.240]   does this mean? Well, it's just another way of saying the same thing again. Our Lord looked
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:04.600]   at Peter and said, "Peter, you have just made a tremendous statement. You have said that
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:11.160]   I am the Christ, the Son of the living God, and you're absolutely right. But you know,
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.720]   Peter, do you know what made you say that? Do you know what enabled you to say it? Do
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.280]   you know how you ever became capable of making such a statement? Well, let me tell you. It
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.600]   isn't flesh and blood. It isn't natural reason. It isn't human understanding. It isn't because
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.920]   you're just a man and because you've got a wonderful brain and a human insight. Flesh
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:36.940]   and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father. This is revelation. This is
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:44.080]   spiritual. This is given. This is from above. It isn't you. It's my Father that has revealed
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:51.920]   it unto you." Now, this is a very important question, therefore.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:59.200]   You see, there are two ways of thinking. We can think after flesh and blood, or we can
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.840]   think in this spiritual manner. Now, the point I'm making, the principle I am enunciating
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:14.080]   is this. That the first test we must all apply to ourselves, if we would know for sure whether
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:23.120]   our souls are lost or not, is this. What is our type of thinking? How are we thinking
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.160]   about life, and how are we thinking about ourselves? We are in this congregation because
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   we are people who think. We are disturbed about the state of the world. We are concerned
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.760]   about ourselves in various ways and manners. And we are thinking. Yes, but the question
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:44.760]   I'm asking is this. What type of thinking is your thinking? Is it flesh and blood thinking?
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:52.040]   Is it the type of thinking that God produces? Those who are familiar with the New Testaments
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:59.120]   will know that this is a distinction and a division that is often brought out very clearly
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.880]   in the New Testament. Let me give you the classical statement of it, which you will
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:12.520]   find in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians and in the second chapter.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:17.800]   We are confronted, says the apostle there, to those clever, brilliant Corinthians who
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:24.160]   are so fond of philosophy and argumentation and reason. We are confronted, says the apostle,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.840]   by this position, that when the Son of God was in this world, the princes of this world
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.480]   did not know him. For had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:42.720]   glory. He says the very princes, the greatest men of the world, when the Son of God was
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   here, they didn't know him. They didn't recognize him. And they condemned him to death.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:53.320]   They said, "Away with him. Crucify him." The princes, the princes of Israel, the religious
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   leaders, their kings, and likewise the Romans, and likewise the Greeks, the great men, the
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:08.600]   great minds, the great brains. But why did they do that? And here is the answer you see.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:17.960]   The natural man, the natural mind, receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:26.560]   are foolishness unto it. Neither can they, because these things are spiritually discerned.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:32.240]   No, no. They couldn't understand why. Well, they were thinking with flesh and blood. They
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.880]   applied their ordinary, natural human reason. And they looked at Jesus of Nazareth and they
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.360]   said, "This man is making great claims, but after all, he is only one who has come out
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.840]   of Galilee. He is only a carpenter. The thing is monstrous. He has never been trained. Who
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:55.040]   is this artisan who stands and says, 'I say unto you, away with this fellow'?" Now, that
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.440]   is flesh and blood thinking, you see. "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,"
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:09.200]   said our Lord to Peter, "but my Father which is in him." And the Apostle Paul re-echoes
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.600]   the same thing when he says that though the princes of this world didn't know him, yet
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:22.880]   God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit, the Spirit which searcheth all things, yea,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:32.280]   the deep things of God. And so I ask you this first, this preliminary question. What type
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:40.800]   of thinking do you indulge in? As you face the world today and its problems and yourself
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:47.000]   and your own personal problems, how are you thinking? Are you thinking with flesh and
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.140]   blood? Are you thinking with your own unaided reason? Are you just dependent upon men? Or
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:58.880]   have you come to this revelation? Does this enter in? Does this form the basis of all
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:06.400]   your thought and all your reasoning processes, each one or the other? And what I am asserting
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:16.560]   is this, that if your thinking is confined to flesh and blood, your soul is lost. That
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:22.200]   is the thing our Lord rebukes. And it's in that context he says to Peter, "Listen, be
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:28.680]   careful," he says, "and all the rest of the disciples." All that, he says, leads to nothing.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:35.360]   That's human, earthly, flesh and blood thinking, and it leads to destruction. Your thinking
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.560]   must become spiritual. Very well, there it is in general, but I can divide it up and
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:50.720]   give it to you more in detail. But let nobody run away from that. We all know perfectly
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:57.020]   well at this moment which type of thinking is our thinking, and that indeed is enough.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:03.540]   But let me help you still further by taking this second question. What is the content
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:11.240]   of our thinking? What do we think about? Because this, again, will indicate very clearly whether
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:17.720]   our soul is lost or whether it is functioning as it is meant to function. Now then, what
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:24.000]   do I find here under the heading of the content? Well, the first thing I notice is this, that
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.360]   the thinking of a man whose soul is lost is governed by certain things, and here they
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:42.640]   are the first, is himself. The man whose soul is lost is a man whose thinking, the content
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:50.400]   of whose thinking, is governed by himself and himself alone. Here is where I find it.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:58.680]   Our Lord, in this very context, utters this word, "Whosoever will save his life shall
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:10.040]   lose it. If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:17.920]   follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:25.440]   life for my sake shall find it." And then comes our text, "For what is a man profited
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:32.760]   if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" Therefore, I deduce this.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:40.360]   The content of the man's thinking whose soul is lost is thinking that he is governed and
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:50.120]   controlled by self, and by self-interest, and by life in this world. That's the thing
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.880]   our Lord is talking about. He says, "Now if you're going to be my disciple, you've got
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:59.640]   to deny yourself," or he puts it in plainer terms, "Whosoever will save his life," that
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:05.620]   means his life in this world, his earthly life, his human life, "Whosoever will save
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:11.440]   his life in this world shall lose it, but whosoever will lose his life in this world
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:17.080]   for my sake shall find it." Now that tells us all about it, doesn't it?
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:24.720]   The characteristic of the man whose soul is lost is that he is only concerned about his
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:31.800]   life in this world. He's concerned about himself and his well-being and his interest in this
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.920]   world. He's out, as our Lord puts it, to save his life in this world. After all, he says,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.880]   "This is the world that matters. I'm not interested in some pie in the sky. I'm not interested
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.600]   in what may happen after I've gone out of this world. I'm here now, and what am I going
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.320]   to get now?" That's the thing. Their life in this world, and he wants to save it, and
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.040]   he spends all his time thinking about it. He's the center of his little universe and
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.100]   everything for himself. "What can I do to be happy? What can I do to get this or that?"
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:07.920]   Always himself. Self. "No, no," says Christ, "you've got to deny yourself if you really
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.360]   want to be my disciple. You've got to lose that self if you really want to find your
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:27.120]   true self and yourself." What is it that governs your thinking, my dear friend? Do you always
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:34.080]   start with yourself, and do you end with yourself? Are you the beginning and the end of your
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:41.360]   little universe? Does all your thinking revolve around about you, your knowledge, your understanding,
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.800]   your ability, and what you have and what you're going to have and what you'd like to have?
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:53.520]   Is your thinking circumscribed always by self? Do you ever get outside that circle? Do you
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:59.600]   ever begin to think about God and about eternity, or is it entirely life in this world and you
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.760]   and the time you're going to have in this world? Now I say that this, RLS, is a certain
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:14.000]   and a sure sign that a man's soul is lost, that it's entirely selfish and self-centered
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.240]   and interested only in self. But then there's another thing that always goes with that.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:27.800]   It's most interesting. The second thing that always governs the thought
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:37.360]   of such a person is the opinions of other people of the same outlook. This is how our
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:50.120]   Lord puts it, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.520]   and follow me." What's he mean by taking up the cross? Well, there is no phrase that is
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.360]   so frequently misunderstood as that phrase of taking up the cross. Many people just think
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.360]   that it means this, that we've got to bear with troubles and sorrows and perplexities
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:15.240]   and problems in this world. It means nothing of the sort. Taking up the cross means this.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:23.000]   It is something that you do as a deliberate act. It's involved in self-denial and in following
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.240]   Christ. Please turn your cassette over at this point
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.480]   for the conclusion of this sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:50.760]   It's involved in self-denial and in following Christ. What's it mean? It means this.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:30:03.960]   That you deliberately, in denying yourself and following Christ, take up this cross of
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:12.280]   being unconcerned about the opinions of other people. It means that you put yourself on
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:19.920]   a cross, because the moment you deny yourself and follow Christ, other people will be involved.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:26.200]   And they will criticize you and they'll be hurt and offended with you, and they'll say
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.120]   all manner of things against you and persecute you. Now, that is what is meant by taking
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.840]   up the cross, that you deliberately say, "Yes, let them do what they like. I'm going on.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:46.400]   I deny myself. I follow Christ." But the man whose soul is lost, you see, doesn't do that.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:55.640]   No, no, he's afraid of the opinion of others. He's governed and controlled by it. If somebody
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:03.680]   expresses an adverse criticism, he's made unhappy. He's depressed. All along, he wants,
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.840]   you see, because his life is centred on himself, he wants the good opinion of others, and he's
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.480]   interested in what they say, and he's concerned about what they say, and indeed his life is
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.080]   controlled very largely by what they say. They say, "He's become a fool. He's become
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:24.480]   soft. He's got religious and they're troubled. Oh, how can I face them?" And so his life
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.880]   is governed not only by his own opinions, which are entirely of flesh and blood, but
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.120]   by the opinions of others, whose opinions are also flesh and blood. And he's afraid
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:41.540]   of them, and he's entirely determined and controlled by them. Those are the characteristics
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:50.720]   of the thinking of a soul that is lost. He hasn't denied himself. He hasn't taken up
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:59.280]   the cross. He's living the typical life of the men of the world, revolving around himself,
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.880]   interested in others who are like him, and concerned about what they think and say, and
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:12.500]   reacting to it. Those are indications of a lost soul. But then we see this still more
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:21.220]   clearly when we consider what this kind of person fails to consider. What is it that
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:27.260]   he fails to consider? Let me just note them to you. The first thing he fails to consider
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:35.580]   is the worth of his own soul. Indeed, he doesn't think about his soul at all. He thinks about
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.260]   his own person, his own appearance, what other people think of him. He thinks of his own
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:45.300]   ability, his own brains, his own position in his profession, his money, his house, his
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:51.860]   friends, his children, all these things. Yes, but he never thinks about his soul. He never
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:58.980]   sits down and says, "But ah, there is that within me which was given to me by God, this
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:04.820]   unseen immaterial part of me, this thing that links me to God." He never thinks about it.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.940]   Never gives it a thought at all. He's not aware of its presence, its significance, and
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:16.660]   its importance in his life. He has no concern about his soul. He's never faced the question
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:24.660]   of his own soul and its eternal destiny. And it is because of that, of course, he doesn't
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:35.140]   think about God. "Thou savourest not of the things that be of God," said our Lord to Peter,
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:44.660]   "but those that be of men." Come, my dear friends, these are very practical questions.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.660]   Your eternal destiny depends upon these. How much time do you give to thinking about your
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:34:00.580]   soul? How much time do you give to thinking about God? How frequently does God enter into
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:07.100]   your mind and into your thoughts? Are you as concerned about God and your relationship
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:12.940]   to him as you are about other people and your relationship to them? You, who can be made
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:18.420]   miserable and wretched by the adverse opinion of another person, have you ever thought what
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:25.700]   God's opinion of you is? Have you ever been troubled by that? You kept awake at night,
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.820]   you couldn't sleep, because you were in a turmoil, because other people had said something
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.220]   unkind about you, and because they hadn't liked you. Have you ever thought what God
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:43.500]   thinks of you and whether God likes you? The man whose soul is lost doesn't think about
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:50.180]   his soul, neither does he think about God and his relationship to him, and in the same
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:58.860]   way, he is unconcerned about this truth concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, who says, "If any man
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:08.780]   would be my disciple, let him deny himself, let him take up his cross, and let him follow
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:14.700]   me." Not the way of the world, not the thing to do, not what everybody else is doing, but
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:21.500]   let him follow me. He who stands there before us, the Christ, the Son of the living God,
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:27.100]   follow me. This man doesn't think about him. He never enters into his calculations. It's
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:35.500]   always other people, it's always self, and never the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:44.900]   These things are plain and simple and obvious, and yet have we applied them to ourselves?
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:52.900]   These are the indications of a lost soul. Worldly flesh-and-blood thinking that reveals
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:36:01.660]   itself in this way, in these wrong concerns and in the absence of the true concerns.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:09.660]   But let me go on to a second principle. Our Lord not only enlightens us here as to the
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:19.580]   indications of a lost soul, he makes a positive statement, which is that there is no greater
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:33.340]   loss than the loss of the soul. "What shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:46.860]   world and lose his own soul?" There is no greater loss than the loss of the soul. Indeed,
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:54.300]   he puts it like this. That to gain the whole world is no compensation for the loss of the
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.740]   soul. And he puts no limit upon it. What he says, "Shall it profit a man, if he shall
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:05.420]   gain the whole world?" Or, "What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" He can't
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:11.500]   give the whole world in exchange for it. That is the measure of the loss of the soul.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:16.980]   But can this be proved? Why should this be the case? Well, I think I can answer in this
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:26.180]   way. I can prove to you that the soul is of greater value than the whole world with all
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:39.020]   its wealth. And I do it in this way. That the wealth of the whole world does not and
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:47.900]   cannot satisfy the soul. It doesn't matter if you gain the whole world of wealth and
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:53.540]   knowledge and influence and power and popularity and anything else you may like to throw in.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:38:05.900]   It will profit you nothing. It will not satisfy you, unless you possess your soul and have
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:10.380]   it in a healthy and in a saved condition. Shall I give you a simple illustration to
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:20.340]   show what I mean? This matter of the soul is very similar to the matter of health. Is
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:28.540]   there any greater tragedy in the world than to see an enormously wealthy man who suffers
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:34.540]   from some crippling illness or disease? You've seen many of them. I've seen many of them.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:41.980]   I remember seeing a man once who was a multimillionaire. Yes, but he was a sufferer from chronic asthma.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:47.580]   And there he was. His wealth was in a sense almost unlimited, but he couldn't breathe.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:52.260]   And what was the value to him of all this great wealth when he hadn't got his health
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:39:00.460]   to enjoy it? Now there is a parallel, you see, an illustration. He had all this wealth
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.740]   and he could buy this, that and the other, but it was of no value to him. He'd lost
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:10.860]   his health. A man's health is more precious than the value of the whole world, for the
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:20.780]   world and its wealth cannot purchase this health or take the question of a man's character.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.340]   If some terribly serious charge is brought against a man's character, and people tend
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:30.620]   to believe it, you go and talk to that man. And if he's a very wealthy man, he'll say
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:36.220]   to you, "Look here, all this is of no value to me as long as my character is lost or is
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:42.020]   in question." And if such a man is in such a position, this is how he argues. The man
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.580]   does it about his health as the man does it about his character. You show me that man
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.860]   with that chronic disease and this is what you'll hear him say. He'll say, "Tell me,
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.320]   do you know of a doctor anywhere in the universe that can help me? I don't care what it'll
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.500]   cost me. I'll travel the whole world. I'll spend my last farthing. I'll give all. I'll
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:07.980]   mortgage everything. If only he can promise to cure me and give me health." Of course.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.940]   The wealth of the world is of no value to the man because he can't enjoy it. He's lacking
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:21.500]   in health. And likewise, the man whose character is being produced by somebody, he says, "I
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:25.980]   want to know the greatest barrister in the world, the mightiest council. What's the value
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:31.620]   of my possessions to me if I've lost my character? I'll mortgage everything in order to defend
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:40.940]   it." Quite right. And you know it's exactly the same with the soul. I care not what you
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:49.140]   are, nor what you possess, nor what you intend to be. But I tell you this, that if your soul
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:56.380]   is lost, that all you have and all you may have and all you are and all you hope to be
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:03.860]   will never give you final satisfaction. This was once put in an immortal phrase by the
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:09.580]   mighty Saint Augustine, who, having tried so much of this other thing, came at last
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:18.460]   to the inevitable conclusion, "Thou," he says to God, "hast made us for thyself. And our
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:28.380]   souls are restless until they find their rest in thee." You know, my friend, the soul that
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:33.900]   God has put within you is so constituted and is as great as this, that the whole world
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:39.220]   cannot compensate for its loss. You can take the world and its wealth, but I say there'll
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.100]   be a running chore in your soul. There'll be a misery. There'll be something gnawing
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.780]   at you. You won't be able to rest in peace. There'll be a dissatisfaction. There'll be
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:54.540]   this restlessness. The world and all that it has to give is not sufficient to compensate
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:42:06.140]   for the loss of the soul. But I can prove it in another way. The world and all its wealth
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:19.260]   is only temporary. Its money, its knowledge, its honors, its reputations, everything that
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:28.460]   the world can give us, and it can give us much, ends with this life and with this world.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:34.820]   It is what our Lord's talking about. "Whosoever shall save his life in this world shall lose
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:40.620]   it." He's bound to, because all that he's gained here he's got to leave behind. You
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.460]   can't take your wealth through the river of death. You can't take your reputation. You
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.500]   can't take your learning. It's of no value there. It's not an exchange that is recognized
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:55.700]   beyond the veil. It's not currency in the spiritual unseen realm. What shall a man give
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:07.700]   in exchange for his soul? The soul goes on. But all that the world can give us at its
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:15.340]   best and highest does not go on, and we cannot take it with us. And therefore I argue that
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:21.460]   to lose the soul is to lose everything, because there I shall find myself at the end, having
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:27.140]   lost my soul and having lost all that the world has given me. I shall be empty-handed.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:33.620]   I shall have nothing at all.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:41.140]   And then, you see, beyond that, here's the terrible aspect of this loss. If my soul is
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:48.820]   lost when I die, I shall go on into eternity with nothing with me, none of the things on
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.980]   which I've lived in this life, none of the things I've hoarded up in trying to save my
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:44:01.500]   life in this world, none of that, and nothing else. I shall be outside the life of God.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.780]   My soul, because it's lost, will be dead to God and His blessings and His glories and
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:12.340]   all that He has to give to the souls that are reconciled to Him. I shall have nothing,
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:17.940]   and that is hell, to have nothing to all eternity, and to realize what a fool I've been.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:25.420]   Our Lord has put it all, hasn't He, in His picture of Dioves and Lazarus, the rich men
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:30.940]   who fared sumptuously, that everything that He wanted, He was saving His life in this
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:37.100]   world, and had been very successful in doing it. But there He is, beyond the veil, beyond
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.940]   death and eternity, and He's got nothing, and He's in a torment, and He's in a flame.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:49.060]   He says, "Go and warn my brethren. It's too late." That's the loss of the soul, eternal
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:56.260]   separation from God, deadness to all that is of value and everything that is noble throughout
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:05.320]   eternity. But perhaps my strongest argument of all, to show the worth of the soul, and
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.460]   to show that there is no greater loss than the loss of the soul, is if I put it like
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:24.660]   this. Did you know, my dear friend, that to lose everything else, even the world itself,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:32.900]   does not matter at all if your soul is right, if your soul is saved. I've shown you negatively
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.940]   that again the whole world is loss and of no value if you lose your soul. I put it round
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:43.100]   the other way. If your soul is right and is saved, well, then it doesn't matter if you
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:52.740]   lose everything else. And this is experience which confirms the teaching of the Scripture.
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:46:03.060]   "The hour is coming," said the Son of God Himself, "when all men shall leave me and forsake
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:17.420]   me, and I shall be left alone; and yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me." "Ah,"
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:25.220]   says the Apostle Paul, later on having given himself to this Savior and trusting to Him,
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:34.780]   "to me to live is Christ, and to die, what is it?" What is death? What's your view of
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:39.740]   death? "Ah, the men of the world say that death is the final robber. It's the thing
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:45.540]   that comes and robs us of everything. It robs us of loved ones. It robs us of possessions.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:50.860]   It robs us of knowledge. It robs us of life. Life, death, what is it? The final robber."
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:47:00.340]   "No, no," says Paul, "to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." "Oh, yes," says a man
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:09.900]   writing centuries later, "when peace like a river attendeth my way, when sorrows like
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:22.260]   sea billows roll, whatever, my lot, thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well with
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:30.780]   my soul. Man may trouble and distress me," says another, "twill but drive me to thy breast.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:39.180]   Life with trials hard may press me. Heaven shall give me sweet arrest." "Yes," says another,
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:48.060]   "rest it you despised, forsaken, thou from hence my all shalt be." Listen to the Son
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:57.100]   of God capping it all when he says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:06.860]   kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." Here is a man
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:12.660]   who has left all for Christ. Here is a man who has not been saving his life in this world,
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:17.640]   but has lost it for Christ's sake. He seems to have given up everything, but listen, he
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:27.260]   is going to inherit the earth itself. "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:33.020]   Oh, it does not matter what you may lose. It does not matter what the world may take
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:39.220]   from you. You may lose your friends. Your family may ostracize you. Everything may go
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:45.780]   against you. If your soul is saved, if your soul is right with God, it will not matter
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.780]   at all.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:49:00.660]   Having this, we eventually shall have all. I say, therefore, that our Lord instructs
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:09.940]   us here that there is no loss in life or in the whole world which is comparable to the
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:20.660]   loss of the soul. My dear friend, I ask my question as I close. What is the condition
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:30.400]   of your soul? Is your soul lost? Apply my tests again. How are you thinking? What are
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:38.000]   you thinking about? What are the terms of your thoughts? Is your soul lost? If it is,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:47.060]   I say, it is the most tragic loss conceivable. The whole world is not of such value as the
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:53.140]   value of your soul. Is your soul lost? If it is, you will be glad to hear me asking
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:50:04.880]   my last question or making my last statement. Is there any hope for a lost soul? Thank God
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:19.280]   there is. What is it? Well, there is only one hope for a soul that is lost. It is this,
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:30.600]   that the Lord Jesus Christ does realize the value of the soul.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:38.280]   Look again, I say, at the one who asked this momentous question. There he stands, Jesus
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:45.600]   of Nazareth, apparently only a man, and yet an unusual man, because everybody is looking
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.840]   at him and talking about him. Some say that he is John the Baptist, some that he is Elias,
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:51:00.600]   some that he is Jeremiah, or at any rate he must be one of the prophets. But he isn't.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:14.540]   Who is he? Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God. And he is here in this world.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.840]   And what is he doing here? What has brought him here? Do you know the answer? He is here
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:27.040]   for one reason only, and that is the value that he attaches to the soul. And I will tell
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:39.960]   you what he thinks of the soul. He values your soul and mine to this extent, that though
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:49.920]   he was in the form of God, he counted it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:58.760]   of no reputation. What blind fools we are! What is the Son of God doing in this world?
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:04.000]   Why is Jesus of Nazareth the Son of God here at all? Why has he come from heaven? Why has
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   he left the courts of eternity? The answer is because he knows the eternal value of the
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:27.440]   soul. He came from heaven to earth. The meaning of the Incarnation is the measure of the value
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:38.120]   that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit attach to the soul of man.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:45.480]   He came from heaven to earth because of the priceless value, the preciousness of your
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:52.520]   soul and mine. But he didn't stop at that. What is this thing that he's telling these
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:59.840]   disciples? From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:05.920]   go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:12.680]   be killed and be raised again the third day. He's going to die. He's come to die. He says,
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:25.040]   "For this hour came I into this world." But why did he die? There's only one answer. He
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:35.240]   died because he knows the value of the soul. He gave his life for ransom. For what? For
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:43.360]   your soul. The price he paid that your soul might be saved was his life, his blood, himself.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:52.480]   He gave himself for us, for our soul. That's the value that he attaches to it. The soul
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:54:00.880]   is not only of greater value than all the world and its wealth. This is its value. The
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:07.800]   Son of the Eternal God came out of eternity into time and humbled himself and took on
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:15.120]   him the form of a man and the form of a servant and went even unto the cross, yea, the death
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:26.600]   of the cross. That your soul and mine might be redeemed and rescued, might be purchased
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:36.680]   from perdition and loss and might be restored unto us all. That is the message for the lost
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:44.240]   soul. There is this hope. It's the only hope. If you have not realized the value of your
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:52.640]   soul, Christ has and has died for you. That he might restore it to you and give it back
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:59.040]   to you in a way and in a manner that you can stand in the presence of God on the day of
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:11.480]   judgment without any fear. And what does he ask of you? He simply asks you to believe
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:20.720]   what he has told you about yourself and about your soul. If any man will be my disciple,
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:26.840]   let him deny himself. Let him stop thinking of the flesh and blood. Let him face this
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:32.120]   and say this is God speaking. I will believe this. I care not what happens to me. This
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:39.000]   is God's truth. I accept it. I believe it. He gives himself. He denies himself. He gives
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:48.560]   himself to Christ. He cares not what anybody else may say. He takes up the cross. And he
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:58.640]   goes after Christ. He simply accepts this thinking, this teaching, this doctrine, this
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:07.760]   truth. He gives himself entirely to it and at all costs, and whatever it may lead to
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:18.240]   in the future, it doesn't matter. He clings to this cross and follows him all the way.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:25.280]   And though, as I said, all men may leave him and forsake him and he may find himself bereft
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:34.600]   of everything, he rejoices in it. And looking at men and women who still belong to the world,
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   he says to them what the Apostle Paul said to King Agrippa and his wife and to the Roman
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:53.380]   governor and his wife, "I would to God that all ye were at this moment such as I am."
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:57:05.320]   He knows both how to be abased and how to abound. He is content. He is happy because
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:16.080]   his soul is right with God. And he sees beyond time the glory that is awaiting him and to
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:32.480]   the joys of everlasting bliss. What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:50.160]   and lose his own soul? What of your soul? Is it lost? If it is, fly to him who can restore
