[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.640]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.740]   My guest today is Dr. Jonathan Haidt.
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.960]   Dr. Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.120]   and professor at New York University.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.680]   He is also the author of several
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.280]   important best-selling books,
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.520]   including "The Coddling of the American Mind,"
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.200]   and more recently, "The Anxious Generation,"
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.000]   how the great rewiring of childhood
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.680]   is causing an epidemic of mental illness.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.280]   And today we talk mainly about "The Anxious Generation."
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.540]   However, it is not a purely pessimistic conversation.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.560]   Indeed, Dr. Haidt offers several clear solutions
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.040]   to the mental health crisis that now exists
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.600]   and that we have all created
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.560]   through the use of smartphones,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.840]   in particular in kids entering
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.800]   and transitioning through puberty.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.740]   During today's episode,
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.680]   we discuss so-called critical or sensitive periods
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.400]   for social development,
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.960]   for the development of an understanding
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.920]   about competition and violence,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.240]   about sex, and how boys and girls
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.540]   are impacted differently by smartphone use,
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.680]   and the specific solutions that do exist
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.720]   and that Dr. Haidt has created
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.280]   that can place boys and girls,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.520]   as well as young adults,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.080]   back on the trajectory of mental health.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.740]   So today's discussion is really one
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800]   that brings together an understanding
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.860]   of neurobiology, psychology, social psychology,
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.840]   and technology in ways that are designed
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.100]   to serve the most critical members of our species,
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.420]   meaning our youth.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.380]   And for those that have already gone through youth,
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.920]   today's discussion is also relevant to you,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.620]   because as many of you know,
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.340]   and perhaps have experienced,
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.060]   most everybody nowadays is challenged in some way
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.500]   by smartphones, both for the utility
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.380]   and the ways in which they can diminish
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.580]   our social and family interactions,
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.480]   academic performance, and more.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.560]   So thanks to Dr. Haidt,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.580]   today's discussion really is a solution-based one,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.660]   and it's one that is sure to educate,
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.100]   inform, and inspire specific positive action.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.860]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.220]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.460]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.440]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.720]   to the general public.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.780]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.780]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.980]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.760]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.620]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580]   Now I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.540]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.780]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.140]   Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.800]   is to make sure that you sleep on a mattress
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.080]   designed specifically for your sleep needs,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.740]   and that's what Helix Sleep mattresses
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.140]   are designed to accomplish.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.700]   If you go to the Helix website
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.500]   and take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.900]   it asks you questions such as,
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.000]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.020]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.100]   Maybe you know, maybe you don't know
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.580]   the answers to those questions.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.420]   In any case, they'll match you to the ideal mattress
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.100]   for your unique sleep needs.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.220]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk Helix mattress.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.780]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.140]   about three and a half years ago,
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.480]   and it's been far and away the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.080]   So if you'd like to try a Helix mattress
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.940]   designed for your unique sleep needs,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.100]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.860]   take that brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.340]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.740]   that's ideal for your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.240]   Right now, Helix is offering 20% off mattresses
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.560]   and two free pillows.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.540]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.180]   to get 20% off and two free pillows.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.580]   Today's episode is also brought to us by AeroPress.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.420]   AeroPress is like a French press,
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.940]   but a French press that always brews
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.420]   the perfect cup of coffee,
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.240]   meaning no bitterness and excellent taste.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.300]   AeroPress achieves this
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.460]   because it uses a very short contact time
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.180]   between the hot water and the coffee.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.420]   And that short contact time also means
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.260]   that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.720]   The whole thing only takes about three minutes.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.280]   I started using an AeroPress over 10 years ago.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.560]   I first learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.120]   who's a former Stanford engineer and inventor.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.760]   I'm a big fan of Adler's inventions.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.580]   And when I heard he developed a coffee maker, the AeroPress,
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.140]   I tried it and I found that indeed,
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.600]   it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.920]   And I'm not alone in my love of the AeroPress.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.400]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.280]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.840]   I'm also excited to share that AeroPress
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   has just released a brand new AeroPress
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.540]   that brews and packs into its own travel tumbler.
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.300]   This new AeroPress called the AeroPress Go Plus
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.160]   makes brewing coffee when traveling incredibly easy.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.660]   The design is really clever.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.980]   The entire AeroPress unit packs really nicely
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.140]   into a custom AeroPress travel thermos
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.660]   that's small enough that it can fit into your carry-on
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.180]   or any form of luggage.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.020]   And with it,
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.980]   you can make an excellent cup of coffee anywhere.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.380]   All you need is some ground coffee and hot water.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.420]   Indeed, I've even used it on the plane,
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.780]   in hotels, of course.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.460]   Basically, I take it with me anywhere
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.260]   I need a great tasting cup of coffee.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.620]   And with Father's Day coming up,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.420]   it makes for a great Father's Day gift.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.860]   If you'd like to try AeroPress,
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.900]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.300]   AeroPress currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.380]   and to over 60 countries around the world.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.840]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.740]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.900]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.940]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.060]   on this podcast,
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.740]   it's the incredible impact that light can have
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.660]   on our biology.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.020]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.780]   red light and near-infrared light
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.400]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.420]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.020]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.980]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.380]   even improvements in acne,
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.100]   reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.660]   improving mitochondrial function,
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.720]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.180]   What sets Juve lights apart,
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.920]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy devices,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.060]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.340]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.400]   and near-infrared light in combination
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.920]   to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.060]   Personally, I use the Juve handheld light,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.540]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.020]   It's only about the size of a sandwich,
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.260]   so it's super portable and convenient to use.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.960]   I also have a Juve whole body panel,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.660]   and I use that about three or four times per week.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.880]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.840]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V, .com/huberman.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.660]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.240]   to all Huberman Loud listeners,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.160]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.080]   Again, that's Juve, J-O-O-V-V, .com/huberman,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.920]   to get $400 off select Juve products.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.040]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Jonathan Haidt.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.600]   Dr. Jonathan Haidt, welcome.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.680]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.880]   I'm a longtime listener.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.640]   I've developed many good habits because of you.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.460]   Thank you.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.300]   - Thank you.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.120]   Well, you look very healthy,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.560]   and I'm delighted to have you here.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.720]   I'm a longtime fan of your work.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.880]   I've read "The Coddling of the American Mind."
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.960]   It's an incredibly important book.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.140]   "The Anxious Generation," incredibly important book.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.820]   I'll just start off with an easy question,
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.580]   which is how are we doing as a species?
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.420]   - How are we doing as a species?
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.960]   Well, as a species, as one of my friends said,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.460]   we're going to be pretty hard to kill off.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.720]   We'll be like cockroaches,
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.640]   and we're pretty inventive in that way.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.940]   But as a civilization,
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.200]   I think we might well be at a point
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.060]   of there are peaks and valleys,
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.560]   and there are some cycles in history.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.100]   And we may be at one of those turning points,
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.960]   and it's going to be pretty unclear
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   what happens over the next five or 10 years.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.120]   It's a very interesting time to be a social scientist.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.220]   I'll just leave it at that.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.080]   - I suppose we can't point to any one factor,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.980]   but we wouldn't be sitting here today.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.560]   You wouldn't have written "The Anxious Generation,"
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.000]   and it wouldn't be having the incredible impact
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.120]   that it's having were it not for the fact
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.940]   that smartphones have dramatically, profoundly changed
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.200]   the way that we interact as a species.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.920]   In fact, a colleague of mine at Harvard, Jeff Lichtman,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.120]   who's world-famous for neuroplasticity,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.240]   said a few years back,
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.000]   this is probably the first time in human history
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.600]   that humans have written with their thumbs,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.760]   implying that the brain representation of the thumbs
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.760]   is probably very different in all of us
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.320]   than it was prior to that,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.960]   because the brain is an adaptive map
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.340]   of our experience in many ways.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.920]   That's a somewhat innocuous example
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.840]   of the changes that have occurred,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.000]   the use of the digits, the thumbs, to write,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.320]   but there's so much more going on now
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.720]   as a consequence of smartphones.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   So if you were to say the day, the date,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.680]   the year in which everything changed,
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.080]   would it be the day that most everyone had
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.040]   and has a smartphone, somewhere around 2010, 2011, 2012,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.920]   or did all this start prior?
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.800]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.920]   - Well, actually, if it's okay with you,
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.040]   I'll answer that by giving sort of the history,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.000]   'cause the short answer would be 2010 to 2015,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.840]   but it'll make more sense
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.200]   if I just sort of go through how we got there.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.560]   So changes in technology, when you connect people more,
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.640]   you get roads, you get telephones.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.200]   These things are all great.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.400]   They lead to massive gains in knowledge, productivity.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.960]   Yes, sometimes there are disruptions,
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.040]   but in the history of humanity, they've been great.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.880]   The internet was that when, you know,
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.120]   you and I are old enough to remember.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.040]   Do you remember the first time you saw a web browser?
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.880]   - I do.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.680]   - And it was like, you mean, I just like,
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   I type in a question and I get the answer?
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.800]   I don't have to go to the library?
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.720]   It was, I mean, it was miraculous.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.800]   And I can talk to people for free.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.000]   I had that by email, which was free.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.520]   So in general, connecting people is good.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.640]   And we were all very optimistic
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.240]   about the internet in the 1990s.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.320]   It was amazing.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.680]   And in our conversation today, I wanna make it very clear.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.920]   The internet is absolutely amazing.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.480]   This is not about how the internet is bad.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.040]   Smartphones or the iPhone, you know, is absolutely amazing.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.240]   Although there are some things about it
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.560]   that are problematic.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.040]   It's really especially social media,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.640]   which has changed things.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.640]   And so if we look at a kid, let's take a teenager in 2010,
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.960]   and let's say January, 2010.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.800]   At that point, there's no Instagram,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.640]   there's no front facing camera.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.280]   They all have, mostly they have flip phones.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.480]   The iPhone came out in 2007,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.320]   but they don't mostly have them.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.000]   And so in 2010, most teenagers are using the flip phone
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.280]   as a tool to call each other, text each other, meet up.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.600]   So when technology helps us achieve our goals, that's good.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.400]   By 2015, everything's different.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.040]   By 2015, the great majority of Americans,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.520]   certainly teens, have a smartphone
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.080]   with a front facing camera.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.040]   The girls are mostly on Instagram,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.160]   which was the first social media platform
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.920]   that you had to be on a smartphone for.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.280]   Everything else was web-based.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.600]   They have high speed internet, unlimited texting.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.400]   And now it's possible to spend 10, 15 hours a day
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.280]   on your phone.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.920]   Nobody could do that with a flip phone.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.640]   So I point to that, it's that five year period,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.760]   2010 to 2015, which I've called
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.120]   the great rewiring of childhood,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.600]   because it affects everything,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.360]   everything about what children and teenagers are doing.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.720]   - I can recall in 2010,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.160]   I was actually in New York City visiting friends.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.000]   I got my first smartphone and I recall
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.360]   I was up at 1.30 in the morning,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.800]   scrolling on this thing and thinking,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.120]   this is unbelievably addicting.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.480]   Nowadays, I think of it less as addicting,
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   but almost like an OCD of sorts.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.840]   And here I'm not talking about clinically diagnosed OCD,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.880]   but the interesting thing about OCD
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.720]   is that the compulsions, the behaviors,
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.640]   don't serve to reduce the obsessions,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.720]   rather they exacerbate them or reinforce them.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.560]   And in many ways, I feel like smartphone use
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.720]   and social media use in particular is an OCD of sorts.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.280]   It's not just a habit, it's not just an addiction,
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.480]   it's an obsessive compulsive loop.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.320]   - So it's already a struggle to pay attention.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.440]   And ancient traditions have taught techniques
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.680]   to improve your focus, your attention,
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.400]   we're easily distracted.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.200]   And so I don't work on my phone very much
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.040]   'cause I hate to type on the phone
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.120]   and I'm always at a computer.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.760]   But even for me, sitting at my computer,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.360]   as soon as the thinking gets hard,
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   as soon as I'm writing,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   I'm doing something that requires concentration,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.280]   some little part of my brain says,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.560]   I wonder what the weather's gonna be,
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.920]   and I go check the weather.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.520]   Or, oh, did I get any email?
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   I go check my, I might check my email,
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.720]   probably 40, 50 times a day.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.520]   And I know that's terrible.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.640]   So the question is, is it a compulsion
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.080]   where I feel pulled, I have to check it
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.480]   or something bad will happen?
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.920]   No, it's more like, imagine trying to do your work,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.320]   imagine trying to be a kid in school
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.200]   and you have, on your desk in front of you,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.600]   you have your television set, your record player,
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.160]   a walkie-talkie to talk to your friends,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.280]   a guitar, a painting set, all arrayed in front of you,
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.080]   and your teacher is telling you about geometry.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.960]   What are you gonna do?
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.400]   Probably one of these things.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.480]   And so I think the smartphone or the flip phone,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.080]   it's a tool, you pull it out
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.400]   if you wanna talk to someone, then you put it away.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.460]   But the smartphone, there's no reason to ever put it away.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.400]   - Talk to us about the scary statistics.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.080]   There's just no way around this.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.480]   And we will talk about solutions.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.240]   You offer some incredible solutions in the book,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.240]   actually solutions that everyone listening
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.560]   and watching can participate in, not just by restriction.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.760]   We'll talk about what that means going forward.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.840]   But where are we at now?
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.040]   And when did we start to see the trend
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.240]   toward diminished mental health, in particular in girls?
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.040]   So feel free to hit us with the scary truth.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.880]   - Okay, sure.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.760]   So let's imagine, so in the US,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.240]   we have really good statistics
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.360]   based on annual or biannual surveys.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.200]   There's three or four big ones
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.100]   that allow us to see what's happened since the '70s.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.200]   And so what I'd like listeners to imagine
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.840]   is imagine a bunch of lines, maybe a line for boys,
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.640]   maybe a line for boys, line for girls,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.160]   showing the percentage that suffer from anxiety,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.240]   depression, or that have self-harm.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.280]   Those three really go together.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.080]   And imagine these lines, they move around a little bit,
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.600]   but they're actually pretty stable from the 1990s
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.080]   all the way through 2010, even 2011.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.740]   There's no sign of a problem.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.120]   On some measures, they get actually a little bit better.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.560]   - So stable and low?
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.560]   - Stable, well, low, if they're around say 12, 15% of girls
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.800]   qualify as having had a major depression,
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.220]   that's much higher than we would like.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.480]   That's a problem.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.040]   But it's nothing compared to what it is today.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.360]   So the lines are pretty flat until around 2012.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.840]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.640]   the lines for girls go up like a hockey stick.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.880]   It's not a subtle thing.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.200]   It really is, there's an elbow,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.080]   it's like somebody turned on a light switch in 2012.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.840]   Now that's for the American data.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.480]   Internationally, you see very similar things.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.740]   It's not necessarily 2012 in other countries.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.640]   But the girls graphs are very sharp.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.360]   The boys are also up on depression, anxiety,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.680]   they're also way up.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.800]   Depending on the measure, it's usually,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.480]   everything is in the ballpark of 50 to 150%.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.920]   Almost all the numbers are in that range.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.160]   We're not talking 10 or 20% increases here.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.720]   For most things, we're talking close to a doubling,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.120]   especially for the younger girls.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   The boys curves, interestingly, are smoother.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.400]   That is the boys are more depressed and anxious.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.800]   But it's not 2012.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.280]   It actually often begins more like 2009, 2010.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.920]   And then it just keeps going up gradually.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.620]   So that's a real clue,
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.200]   which we'll come back to when we talk about the boys story.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.600]   A lot of people say, "Oh, it's just self-report.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.160]   "Gen Z, they're really positive about mental health
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.140]   "and they're willing to talk about it.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.640]   "It's a good thing."
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.040]   But the fact that we see the exact same curves,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.840]   the very sharp uptick for girls
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.920]   in hospital admissions for self-harm,
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.960]   psychiatric emergency department visits,
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.160]   and we see this in the US, Canada, Australia,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.120]   New Zealand, the UK, the Scandinavian countries.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   So something happened across the developed world around 2012
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.240]   and I keep, Jean Twenge was the first
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.320]   to really raise the alarm.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.760]   She and I keep saying,
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.880]   "Well, we can't find another candidate.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.200]   "Nothing else fits the pattern.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.620]   "Oh, and there's actually not just correlational data,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.400]   "there's experimental data too."
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.720]   So we think, of course, look, everything's complicated.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.440]   Mental health is complicated.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.020]   If you wanna understand why one person is depressed,
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.840]   there are gonna be many stories.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.400]   But if you wanna understand why depression rates rose
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.500]   for girls faster than boys all over the developed world,
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.060]   unless someone can find like some hormone disrupting chemical
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.880]   that was suddenly sprayed over Northern Europe
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.740]   and the South Pacific and the US and Canada around 2012,
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.240]   there is no alternative explanation.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.160]   - So we break down smartphone use in these young girls
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.220]   that correlates with and maybe is causal
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.220]   for this diminishment in mental health.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.560]   There are a number of different variables, right?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.800]   There's the time spent on the phone.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.960]   There's the specific content that they're viewing.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.900]   And that's a vast discussion that we'll get into.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.360]   There are the social dynamics associated
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.880]   with being on a phone as opposed to in-person interactions.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.160]   And then there's, and I can't help myself,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.240]   but as a neuroscientist who trained in the biology,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.900]   the visual system, there's the effect of looking
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.880]   at something at about eight inches to 12 inches away
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.060]   from you for much of the day,
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.540]   as opposed to navigating an environment the way
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.120]   that we had for hundreds of thousands of years prior.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.920]   So there are a lot of features within this thing
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.680]   that we call smartphone use.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.020]   There's also the disruption in sleep.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.220]   There's additional blue light exposure.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.120]   There's just so much to it.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.400]   So if we pull all that together for the time being
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.480]   and put in a basket of smartphone use,
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.600]   and maybe we'll pull out each of those variables
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.060]   one by one as we go forward.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:39.060]   What are the numbers in 2012 in terms of how much time girls,
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.560]   maybe you can give us an age range,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.280]   are spending with the smartphone?
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.640]   Was it they got the smartphone
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.680]   and immediately we're spending six to eight hours a day
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.720]   on the thing or has it been gradual?
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.460]   So let's start with the time variable.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.300]   - Sure.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.960]   Okay, so first, the way you put it is actually very helpful.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.720]   What I want listeners to imagine,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.000]   let's say like imagine on the left side of a slide,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.600]   I haven't made this slide, I'm formulating in my head.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.200]   Imagine on the left side of the slide,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.080]   a whole bunch of harmful changes.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.760]   If you're getting less sleep, that's bad.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.420]   If you're having blue light at night, that's bad.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.160]   If you're not going out in nature, that's bad.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.120]   If you are sedentary, if you,
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.560]   so imagine about 15 different things.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.040]   Oh, if you're being contacted by strange men
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.640]   around the world who want to have sex with you,
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.520]   like that's not good for 11, 12 year old girls.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.400]   So there's all these different potential harms.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.680]   And then imagine all these different potential effects,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.040]   one of which is depression and another is anxiety
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.320]   and another is self-harm.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.560]   But there's doing worse in school,
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.120]   there's becoming more shallow,
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.880]   there's conflicts with your,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.640]   so there's a whole bunch.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.060]   And then we want to look at the causal connections.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.600]   And what I'm trying to draw out
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.560]   is suppose we could quantify the degree to which
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.080]   sheer time, just spending five hours a day,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.760]   does that make you more anxious automatically?
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.640]   Well, maybe a little,
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.780]   but that's probably not the main effect.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.780]   So there's a gigantic multi-causal network of effects.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.320]   Now, I have good numbers for how much the,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.640]   how much teens are using these devices
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.820]   and these platforms today.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.700]   Pew in particular did,
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.500]   has done a great job of tracking changes in this
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.580]   since the 2000s.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.780]   What we know today from both Pew and Gallup
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.220]   is that young people in America
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.660]   are now spending about five hours a day
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.580]   just on social media, just social media.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.340]   - Mostly Instagram?
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.180]   - So the huge time suck is the videos.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.860]   So it's actually TikTok and YouTube
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.180]   are counted in this analysis,
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.460]   they're counted as social media.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.520]   YouTube is marginally social media,
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.080]   it's more of an information source.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.580]   But the point is, especially the short videos,
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.460]   the short videos are really, really addictive
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.620]   because the time between action and reinforcement
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.500]   is so quick that that, as you know, in behaviorism,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.000]   like that's the key, it's the quick reinforcement.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.860]   So five hours a day,
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.100]   it's a little bit more than that for girls,
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.380]   a little less for boys,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.140]   just on social media,
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.540]   35 hours a week of strange stuff
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.900]   coming in from random weirdos on the internet.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.180]   35, imagine letting your kid import 35 hours.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.540]   Then you add in everything else,
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.900]   video games, everything else you do on a smartphone.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.840]   So now we're up to seven to 10 hours in that range a day,
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.300]   and this is not counting school.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.780]   Now of course in school, six hours a day,
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.700]   for a lot of kids, two or three hours of that
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.080]   is screen time as well.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.060]   So that's why I say,
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.020]   kids used to have a play-based childhood,
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.080]   play is the basic thing mammals do.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.660]   And since 2010 or 2012,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.940]   our kids have a phone-based childhood.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.540]   And I don't think that is,
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.160]   it's just incompatible with healthy human development.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.060]   - Maybe we can back up even before 2010
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.700]   and talk a bit more about the play-based childhood.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.220]   I heard you say last night
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.240]   at a terrific lecture that you gave
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.880]   that when we don't trust our neighbors,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.700]   we are far less likely to let our kids out to play
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.180]   without observation or oversight.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.620]   And that leads to a whole host of negative consequences.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.840]   So if we were to dial back the history clock even further
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.180]   and talk about, let's say the 1950s, '60s and '70s,
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.580]   I was born in '75.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.700]   I basically was kicked out of the house every day to go play.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.260]   My mom would say, "Get out of the house."
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   I now realize she wanted space,
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.140]   but we would go down the end of the street to the cul-de-sac
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.380]   and we would just play and do all sorts of things.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.660]   - Get into a little trouble, adventure.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.960]   - Destructive, some of which were good.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.580]   And there were a lot of dynamics
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.980]   that got worked out in that process.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.460]   My sister would go hang out
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.580]   with basically the older sisters of those boys.
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.180]   That's kind of how our neighborhood happened
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.940]   to be arranged, that was fortunate.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.980]   And they would do their thing.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.340]   So 1950s and '60s,
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.640]   what did social dynamics look like among kids?
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.260]   - Yeah, so I think what we need to do
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.780]   is tell this story of what happened
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.540]   as a tragedy in three acts.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.320]   And the first act is the loss of community,
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.400]   the loss of trust in each other.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.180]   So if we go back to the '50s and '60s,
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.320]   but we can even go back,
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   my parents grew up in New York City in the '30s and '40s.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.100]   People spontaneously organized themselves into villages.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.800]   Village life seems to be sort of the default way of living
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.640]   that humans have preferred for several thousand years.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.020]   And it's where you know your neighbors,
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.620]   the kids run around,
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.340]   all the adults take part in supervising all the kids,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.620]   but nobody has to helicopter
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.580]   because the kids are playing, they're doing their thing.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.180]   If there's a real threat, if there's a lion or invaders,
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.020]   then they all come running home, whatever.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.840]   But kids need to be out playing with each other,
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.120]   especially outdoors.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.240]   We evolved in savannas,
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.280]   we evolved in different parts of the world,
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.620]   we're attracted to nature.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.560]   So that's the way it always was.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.880]   Now, especially if we, in the 1950s and '60s,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.160]   America had just been through a world war,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.640]   and the greatest way to make people trust each other,
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.240]   the greatest way to boost social capital is a foreign attack.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.000]   And of course, Pearl Harbor did more for American coherence
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.400]   than anything else in modern history.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.600]   9/11 did that too, but only for a little while,
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.980]   and then we lost it.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.920]   So for a lot of reasons, people trusted their neighbors,
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.560]   kids were out playing,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.180]   my parents grew up in the Depression in New York City,
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.240]   the kids are all out playing stickball on the street,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   or in a parking lot.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.660]   In the 1970s, there is a real crime wave.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.520]   Crime goes through the roof, actually.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.560]   And it goes through the '80s,
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.480]   that goes all the way to the early '90s.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.660]   Even still, you were kicked out of the house to go play.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.600]   Even in New York City, all kids went out to play.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.920]   That's just the way it was.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.580]   But we began to lose trust in each other
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.860]   for a lot of reasons.
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.920]   Robert Putnam wrote about this in "Bowling Alone,"
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.320]   the loss of social capital.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.780]   Many reasons for that, the changing media environment,
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.560]   air conditioning and television,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.420]   people are not hanging out on their porch in the summertime
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.800]   to get away from the heat.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.760]   They close the door and they put on the AC
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.200]   and they watch TV.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.440]   Family sizes are shrinking,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.040]   there are not that many kids around.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.240]   So for a lot of reasons, the '90s is the key decade
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.240]   where Act II of the tragedy happens,
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.540]   and that's the loss of the play-based childhood.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.200]   So in America and Britain,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.620]   we freaked out about child abduction
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.040]   and child sexual abuse.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.240]   Some of the scandals were real.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.600]   The Boy Scouts, the Catholic Church,
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.980]   there were cases where trusted organizations
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.800]   were covering up abuse.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.080]   - And I recall the abduction thing, the milk carton thing.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.120]   - Yep, that's right.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.200]   - And there was a show, I think my name is Brian.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.040]   - Oh, okay.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.880]   - About the kid who was abducted and then all he remembered,
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.720]   I think it's a true story,
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.140]   that his name was Brian.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.640]   He would just remind himself every night
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.160]   about his real name.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.200]   I think they found him eventually in Berkeley.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.120]   Not calling out Berkeley,
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.440]   I lived in Berkeley for a long time.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.440]   But it seemed to be the discovery of abducted kids,
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.120]   excuse me, in Berkeley.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.360]   There are a few other cases there,
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.000]   I don't know what that's about.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   In any event, I grew up thinking
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.320]   that you could get kidnapped.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.360]   - Right, yeah.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.500]   Which is, so it's, I mean,
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.840]   it's the most terrifying possibility for any parent.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.680]   But when I was doing the research
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.840]   for the Coddling the American Mind,
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.600]   I found, according to FBI statistics,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.800]   there's only about 100 to 150 true kidnappings a year
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.260]   in our whole country.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.440]   Because if a child, like who would take a child?
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.160]   Like it's a really difficult crime
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.360]   and you're gonna, you know.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.080]   Who would steal a child from a store?
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.540]   You know, parents are afraid if your kid
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.800]   goes to the next aisle in the grocery store,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.120]   they're gonna be, how are you gonna take
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.720]   a kicking and screaming kid out of a store?
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.760]   - And yet, sorry to interrupt,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.440]   but the show America's Most Wanted,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.140]   I believe, was hosted by a guy
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.200]   whose kid was abducted and eventually found dead.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.440]   - Exactly, Adam Walsh, that's right.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.160]   - Right, so there was this propagation of this fear.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.000]   - That's right, it happens.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.200]   - I mean, like one of the deepest fears
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.440]   of any parent I can imagine is that.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.800]   - That's right, but the point is
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.200]   that these crimes are extraordinarily rare.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.620]   It's almost always the non-custodial parent
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.560]   who takes a kid.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.400]   It's a family member
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.040]   because there's a fight within the family.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.280]   So we fear the wrong things.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.880]   We're terrified of kidnapping.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.440]   But locking our kids up, overprotecting them
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.440]   has spiked the suicide rate so much
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.720]   that the death toll is vastly higher
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.900]   from the extra suicides than it would be
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.880]   if we could completely wipe out kidnapping,
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.440]   which again doesn't, but the availability heuristic
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.360]   we say in psychology, if it's visible,
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.320]   if it comes to mind easily,
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.880]   then people will freak out about that.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.460]   And that's why people sometimes are afraid
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.460]   to fly in a plane.
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.080]   They think a car is safer.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.200]   So for a lot of reasons, we freak out in the '90s.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.720]   We stop letting our kids out.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.320]   We think they must always be supervised.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.960]   So that's act two of the tragedy.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.440]   And as that act is happening,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.080]   we're keeping our kids inside.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.200]   And guess what?
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.960]   These computer things that we started getting in the '80s,
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.920]   they're getting interesting
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.040]   because now we hook them up to the internet.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.280]   In the '80s, what we can do,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.260]   WordStar and some primitive video games.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.240]   But in the '90s, you get the internet.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.880]   And now the kids, especially the boys,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.780]   the early internet was much more of interest to boys.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.080]   Boys would take computers apart.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   They could build computers.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.680]   They would learn to program.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.240]   So the boys in particular,
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.640]   they're okay with losing out on the outdoor play
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   'cause the internet is so amazing.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.960]   - And nerddom started to become cool.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.800]   - Yes, geeks.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.720]   - Revenge of the Nerds, Steve Jobs,
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.560]   and Steve kind of,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.200]   and I know 'cause I grew up in Palo Alto,
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   see Steve downtown.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.640]   He had this, it wasn't really like rockstar persona,
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.200]   but he kind of weaved back and forth.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.280]   So he was an icon, kind of like a counterculture guy,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.920]   but then he was into design and computers, right.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.760]   But he was still really geeky.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.520]   Like the fonts were lame.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.360]   - Yeah.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.240]   - He brought beautiful fonts to it.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.040]   He started bringing the aesthetic forward.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.880]   - Yeah.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.720]   - And then of course,
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.160]   girls and women got involved in computers more.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.480]   - Yes, although that really,
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.080]   it only really evens out once you get social media.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.680]   Boys are more interested in things
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.860]   and mechanics and systems.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.440]   Girls have a more evolved and elaborate mental map
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.280]   of social space.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.260]   They're more interested in social relationships.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.320]   So once you get social media,
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.800]   that attracts the girls more.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.920]   And then it becomes pretty even
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.360]   that all boys and girls,
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.120]   they're just incredibly attracted to the internet
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.220]   and things on the internet.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.780]   But that sets us up for act three,
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.400]   which is the great rewiring.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.120]   That's the arrival of the phone-based childhood
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.880]   that we just talked about between 2010 and 2015.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.800]   That's when everything changes.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.660]   As many of you know,
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.560]   I've been taking AG1 for more than 10 years now.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.040]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.800]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.900]   Rather, they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.320]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.800]   And I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.360]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.560]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.520]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.880]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.560]   a vegetarian, or a vegan,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.760]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.280]   that you should get most of your food
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.300]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.800]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.360]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.400]   probiotics, and micronutrients
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.840]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.600]   Now, I personally am an omnivore,
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.160]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.960]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.940]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.560]   and often twice every day is that it ensures
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.280]   I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.120]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.400]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.080]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.320]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.360]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.960]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.640]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.680]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.840]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.240]   So while many supplements out there
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.400]   are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.160]   AG1 is foundational nutrition
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.320]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.840]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.240]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.700]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.120]   to claim a special offer.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.240]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.840]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.440]   Okay, so we've got three acts, all of which are tragedies.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.280]   - Loss of community.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.360]   - Right, so community and trust is down.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.680]   - That's right, which then makes us not...
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.600]   Then act two is we take away the play-based childhood,
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.440]   'cause we're so afraid
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.040]   'cause we no longer trust our neighbors.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.960]   And then act three is as long as the kids are inside
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.440]   and on computers already,
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.680]   oh, well now just a smartphone and a tablet.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.480]   These are just cooler computers.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.040]   Nothing wrong with that, right?
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.280]   And that's what we thought early on.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.120]   In the early 2010s,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.160]   we thought these things were miraculous.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.900]   Oh, if my kids use them,
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.660]   maybe they'll be the next Steve Jobs.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.640]   Maybe they'll be really technically sophisticated,
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.520]   we thought, and it's not true.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.040]   - And now we're in this third act of the tragedy.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.080]   You touched on some of the male-female differences.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.360]   Maybe you could talk about those a little bit more.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.520]   So you said girls tend to focus more on social dynamics,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.560]   boys more on systems.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.160]   I've heard you say that the boys in general
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.360]   veer toward more, for lack of a better way to put it,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.760]   more on the spectrum type behaviors.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.720]   Could you elaborate on that
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.040]   and how it impacts online use and the particular sites
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.600]   that they tend to gravitate towards
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.800]   and then on the other side for girls?
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.320]   - Yeah, one of the psychological traits
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.240]   that is the biggest differentiator between boys and girls
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.760]   and between men and women,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.640]   it's, let me state clearly,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.780]   that sex differences in ability
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.560]   are generally pretty small
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   and they're few and far between.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.000]   Sex differences in interest are all over the place
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.360]   and they're often very large
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.500]   and they're true across cultures
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.840]   and some are true across species.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.480]   It's what do you enjoy?
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.880]   And so, and here I'm drawing on the work
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.520]   of Simon Baron-Cohen,
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.340]   who's the cousin of Sasha Baron-Cohen in the UK.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.880]   And Baron-Cohen's work on autism
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   shows that because of prenatal effects,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.600]   prenatal testosterone changing the body,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.340]   changing the brain,
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.360]   we all start off as girls in utero after conception,
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.580]   but then the 10th week of gestation,
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.760]   if there's a Y chromosome,
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.280]   it triggers a little bit of a testosterone,
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.760]   which then makes the testes develop
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.360]   and then that creates testosterone.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.160]   And all of this, the effect on the brain
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.360]   appears to be a shift away,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.560]   a little bit away from empathizing in Baron-Cohen's terms.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.720]   You can either be a high empathizer
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.840]   or you can be a high systemizer.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.180]   Systemizers are people who love subway maps
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.440]   and they pick them up quickly
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.560]   and they like programming
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.300]   and they like to see how systems are related.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.240]   It's possible to be high on both,
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.080]   but most people are more one way than the other.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.800]   So once you see that,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.480]   now you can understand why this amazing new internet
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.880]   drew everybody,
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.840]   but it drew the boys and the girls to different parts of it.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.320]   And so, a metaphor that I've started using these days,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.400]   I actually did get this from,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.360]   Yasha Monk has a great book called "The Identity Trap."
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.320]   And Yasha points out that a trap
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.880]   has to have bait in it that's attractive.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.840]   There has to be something
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.680]   that makes the creature want to go into the trap.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.280]   And then once they get the bait,
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.640]   there has to be something that prevents them from leaving.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.360]   That's what a trap is.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.300]   And in this case, if you wanna catch a girl,
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.560]   don't show her like the operating system of a computer,
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.560]   don't show her war games,
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.320]   show her what Maria just said about Julia
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.560]   or what Julia just said about her.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.440]   Do you wanna know?
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.000]   Of course you wanna know.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.040]   And everybody does, but girls more than boys,
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.200]   they wanna understand the social dynamics.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.520]   So the girls go rushing into Instagram
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.280]   where everyone's posting photos of themselves,
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.640]   of other people, of the party they were at.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.680]   The girls go rushing into social media in general,
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.200]   Instagram, Pinterest, and Tumblr were the three big ones
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.280]   that girls went into in the early 2010s.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.680]   And then once they take the bait, they can't escape
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.080]   because now that everyone is talking on Instagram,
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.960]   let's say, if you leave, you're alone,
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.440]   you're not gonna talk to anyone.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.520]   So that's how you trap girls
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.180]   and that's what happened to girls.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.060]   How do you trap boys?
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.400]   What are the things that boys most wanna do?
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.000]   If you let them do whatever they want,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.500]   what are the two things that really attract them?
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.520]   One is war and the other is sex.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.260]   So if you say, do you wanna watch a movie
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.460]   that has violence in it?
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.000]   Or do you wanna watch sports,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.520]   which is play war?
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.680]   Boys are more likely to say yes.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.320]   - Or play a first-person shooter game.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.480]   - Exactly, that's right.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.160]   So it's hunting and it's war.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.640]   And if you can simulate that,
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.920]   when I was a kid, there was the beginning,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.480]   I mean, I remember playing Seawolf,
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.920]   like you shoot missiles, you shoot torpedoes
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.260]   at a boat in the distance
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.100]   and it was very primitive technology.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.480]   - Or even a battleship.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.840]   - Yeah, oh, that's right, even a battleship.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.680]   That's right, that's right.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.500]   - That was a big deal.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.340]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.760]   These little plastic boats, that's right.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.460]   - Yeah, sinking somebody else's battleship
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.520]   by intuing where the location of their ships were
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.740]   behind a wall.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.080]   It was so satisfying to sink somebody's battleship.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.540]   - So boys really wanna play at war.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.260]   And I really learned this when I was 30
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.420]   and I have a group of buddies from college
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.920]   and we get together once a year.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.540]   And one year I hosted in Charlottesville
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.520]   and we played paintball.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.260]   We went to a paintball place
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.420]   and there were about five or seven other guys
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.000]   and we divided up into teams
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.580]   and we were divided among ourselves on the teams.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.060]   And it was unbelievably thrilling to work with other guys
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.820]   to hunt and shoot my friends.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.740]   And we came out afterwards, all of us.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.440]   And it hurts when you get hit with a paintball.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.280]   - Yeah, those things hurt.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.100]   - It hurts.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:27.940]   - Your wealth.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:28.780]   - Yeah, that's right, which is important.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.600]   It's actually very important
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.780]   because then you really take it seriously.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.420]   You really don't wanna get shot.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.180]   But it was absolutely thrilling.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.500]   It really felt like there was a room in my heart.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.600]   As a man, there's a room in my heart for war
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.380]   that had never been opened.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.180]   So boys wanna play at that.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.660]   And then the multiplayer video games,
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.740]   the first person shooter games,
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.700]   all these things, let them do that.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.540]   The other thing, of course,
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.100]   that boys wanna do is look at naked women.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.300]   And so, it used to be Playboy Magazine.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.780]   Now it's super hardcore sex with anal sex
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.120]   and gang bangs and choking and all sorts of things.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.900]   So the boys really get, that's how you trap a boy.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.820]   Show them war, let them play war games and give them sex.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.380]   And once they do that, they can't escape.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.520]   - So interesting.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.320]   We did an episode long ago on sexual development,
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.340]   meaning how hormones influence brain development,
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.700]   which I spent a little bit of time on for my master's.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.820]   And by the way, you got the biology exactly right.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.300]   - Okay, okay.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.060]   - And it's fascinating the way
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.300]   that these hormones organize the brain.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.940]   And some people enjoy learning
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.760]   that it's testosterone from the testes.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.400]   It's the Y chromosome, then the testes,
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.580]   and then testosterone that's converted to estrogen
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.420]   that then actually has the organizing effects
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.920]   of masculinizing the brain.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.180]   There are all these flips in biology,
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.100]   counterintuitive flips.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.540]   But I like to mention the flips
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.060]   because they normalize the idea
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.520]   that testosterone creates maleness
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.940]   and estrogen creates femaleness.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.280]   That's actually not true.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.500]   But you got the biology exactly right.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.700]   But I was gonna add one more thing
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:58.580]   besides war, violence, and sex.
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:03.500]   There seems to be an interest by boys
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.860]   in remote control things.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.820]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.540]   Action at a distance.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.640]   - Action at a distance, so remote control cars.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.200]   I never had a remote control helicopter.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.640]   I would have died to get one,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.580]   but remote control car that we built,
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.500]   my dad and I built together, that was thrilling.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.340]   - Absolutely.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.960]   - And then when we talk about girls
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.420]   and some of the preferences for certain activities,
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.540]   maybe we'll get into some others.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.340]   But yeah, something about remote control,
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.020]   vehicles, and vehicles generally.
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:30.860]   - That's right.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.940]   So there's an important psychological word
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:37.380]   called effectance made up by White in the 1950s.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.140]   Effectance is the desire to be a cause.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.880]   I had this effect on the world.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.080]   And a nine-month-old infant in the crib,
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.600]   when he discovers if I pull this,
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.960]   if I hit this, a sound happens.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.320]   It's thrilling.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.840]   You did that.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.400]   And this stays with us for life.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.440]   You wanna see that the things you do have an effect.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.720]   And especially boys are more in the physical world,
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.120]   mechanical world.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.080]   And so shooting a gun, I remember when I was a kid,
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.040]   I had a BB gun that I bought at a church bazaar.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.400]   I hid it from my mother, kept it in the closet.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.440]   But my best friend and I,
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.280]   we'd set up cans on a row and you shoot them
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.820]   and boom, you knock it, it's amazing, it's thrilling.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.080]   That does seem to be a sex difference.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.160]   Now girls, I think, now here I'm speculating,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.560]   but girls seem to be more interested
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.840]   in having an effect in the social world.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.960]   So everybody wants to have an effect,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.520]   but boys are more focused on mechanics,
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.480]   girls a bit more on relationships in the social world.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.980]   - And I'm sure Freud had a field day with this,
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.880]   but what is the apparent,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.520]   I don't have the numbers on this,
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.520]   obsession of girls and horses and caretaking of animals.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.640]   And yet there are also a lot of wonderful stories
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.720]   about boys taking care of dogs.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.600]   Like I read "Where the Red Fern Grows" maybe 50 times
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.740]   and I love dogs, I love taking care of raising my dog.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.680]   But there seems to be something about the stereotype
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.240]   is girls and horses.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.080]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.700]   - Yeah, well, the simple part is girls on average
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.560]   are a little bit more compassionate.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.720]   They feel the pain of creatures more.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.680]   Boys are more into animal cruelty as a fun thing to do,
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.320]   an interesting thing to do, effective.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.240]   So girls are more compassionate.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.840]   Girls tend more to wanna be a veterinarian than boys do
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.240]   'cause girls love animals.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.760]   My daughter was desperate for a pet
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.080]   and we got her a leopard gecko
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.000]   when she was about eight or nine.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.560]   They're really cool, but she was crying one day
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.000]   'cause she could tell like, "It's never gonna love me."
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.200]   And she desperately wanted--
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   - You don't know, maybe it's a lynx or--
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.800]   - No, it's a reptile, no, they're not mammals.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.120]   They don't have the bond.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.720]   And she was desperate for a dog
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.520]   and she begged for years for a puppy.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.800]   We finally got one.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.520]   - She needed an animal with a forebrain.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.680]   - She needed an animal, yeah.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.360]   She needed a mammal, she needed a mammal.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.040]   Now the horse thing, that's different.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.320]   I'm not gonna speculate on that.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   I have heard some speculation that it's
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.520]   because the musculature, it's something about,
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.880]   it has a feeling of masculinity,
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.720]   but I don't know.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.540]   - But that's very Freudian.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.200]   I was wondering whether or not it was the--
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.360]   - I don't even got near that.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.820]   - Yeah, I was wondering whether or not
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.520]   it was something about the healthy requirement
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.080]   for caretaking, the brushing, the cleaning,
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.400]   the caretaking of the animal.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.880]   It's pretty elaborate when it comes to a horse.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.000]   My first girlfriend had a horse.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.480]   She spent more time with that horse than with me.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.800]   And the amount of care, like if the horse was collocking,
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.240]   she would literally go sleep with it in the barn.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.720]   And it seemed like she loved the amount of love
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.000]   that was available to give to the animal.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.440]   Yeah, anyway.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.200]   - I would put that in a giant bucket called biophilia.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.520]   It's a term that I love from E.O. Wilson.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.520]   Just that our species, we evolved in nature.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.400]   We evolved with relationships with animals.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.200]   And we crave it, we seek it out.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.520]   We can fall in love with animals.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.200]   We have relationships.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.800]   So I think that's a healthy part of life.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.320]   And again, it's another area where a phone-based childhood
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.400]   just takes you away from all of that.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.600]   - It's interesting this difference
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.200]   between systems and relationships.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.840]   I was obsessed with aquaria, still am.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.840]   I love aquaria.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.040]   I love freshwater tanks.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.560]   Aquascaping is something I plan to get back into
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.760]   at some point soon.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.040]   But the most interesting part about it
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.960]   was which fish could go with which,
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.880]   who would eat who, how many plants,
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.760]   what the density of fish needed to be
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.640]   in order to maintain the ecosystem
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.280]   and how to not get a system crash.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.880]   It wasn't so much about the relationship
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.320]   between the fish or to the fish.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.920]   - That's right, so it'd be interesting to see
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.240]   if there's a sex difference on aquariums,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.360]   whether it's more a boy thing
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.800]   because of the interest in complex systems.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.000]   But you know what I'd really like to do with you now,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.560]   as long as we're talking about
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.240]   sort of these developmental pathways,
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.160]   I'm hoping that we can talk about,
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.960]   oh, let's stay on sexual development
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.800]   'cause this is something,
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.880]   I just have a little section in the book.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.000]   In the chapter on boys,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.200]   I have a section where I review the research on pornography
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.180]   and huge amounts of study of pornography over the years.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:16.440]   But the hardcore pornography, high resolution video,
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.560]   boys watching it for, many boys,
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.480]   well, a large number of boys
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.080]   go every day to pornography sites,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.280]   often more than once a day.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.240]   So I'd love to hear your thoughts
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.760]   on how is that gonna change sexual development
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.580]   during puberty?
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.560]   A boy who starts, let's say, at age 12, 13
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.080]   and does it for 10 years,
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.520]   could we expect that that boy will be different
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.640]   when he's 22?
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.920]   His dating life will be different.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.760]   Tell me what you think is happening there
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.680]   in the brain and socially and hormonally.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.700]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.240]   And I'm not going to demonize pornography
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.600]   nor am I going to celebrate it.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.800]   All I'll say is that my understanding
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.720]   of the dopamine reinforcement system,
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.280]   and I like to call it a reinforcement system
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.640]   as opposed to a reward system
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.400]   because people generally think that
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.000]   dopamine and dopamine hits relate to pleasure,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.280]   but dopamine is more of a motivator.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.960]   As a neuromodulator, it creates a kind of an agitation state
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.920]   that puts us in a state of focus and foraging
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.240]   to resolve some gap between how we feel
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.400]   and how we'd like to feel
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.120]   by seeking things like sex, like food when we're hungry,
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.240]   like warmth when we're cold, like cool when we're too warm.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.400]   It's a universal currency of pursuit,
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.440]   of craving and wanting as opposed to having.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   Dopamine does a lot more than that.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.440]   And other neuromodulators are involved
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.040]   in wanting and craving, but dopamine is central to that.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.440]   So I think it's not just fair to say,
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.720]   but it's a ground truth that whether or not
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.040]   it's a drug like methamphetamine, cocaine,
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.400]   crack cocaine in particular,
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.840]   or some other drug that hits the system fast
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.280]   and creates a big, big inflection in dopamine,
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.400]   that the more rapid the rise in dopamine,
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.920]   the bigger the crash in dopamine afterwards,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.360]   and the more miserable you feel afterwards.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.840]   And the more repeat of the behavior
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   that initiated the peak will occur, aka addiction,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.080]   or at least extreme habit formation,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.040]   depending on how one defines those.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.680]   When it comes to dopamine,
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.080]   the other key thing to know is that dopamine,
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.880]   in particular, high inflections in dopamine,
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.560]   big peaks in dopamine that occur without much effort,
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.520]   in particular, the kinds of effort that evolved
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.800]   to bring about the dopamine release,
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.480]   such as courting, dating, learning your preferences,
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.000]   learning the other person's preferences,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.640]   working out issues of discussion, consent,
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.760]   negotiation, et cetera.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.180]   When dopamine arrives quickly without effort,
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.200]   such as with amphetamine, crack cocaine, or pornography,
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.760]   the whole reinforcement loop
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.620]   becomes wired to these short timescales.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.980]   You want something, you want it now, and you get it.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.740]   But over time, you get less and less of the dopamine peak,
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.780]   and you get more of the dopamine trough that occurs.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.720]   You drop below baseline afterwards.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:17.960]   So all of that is a bunch of neurobiological-ish,
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:23.760]   nerd-speak for absolutely the ready availability
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.680]   of pornography at a few taps on the phone.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.840]   No doubt triggers big dopamine.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.160]   The first time requires more and more investment
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.960]   in that behavior to get less and less of the dopamine.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.000]   You never get back to the initial value,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.460]   and you're driven further and further down
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.480]   the pathway of addiction.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.640]   And there's the loss of all the learning
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.800]   that the brain has evolved
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.400]   to learn how to evoke dopamine from,
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.720]   I don't want to say just mate pursuit,
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.120]   but it's courtship and eventually sex.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.900]   So, and we know that after ejaculation, after orgasm,
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.040]   there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.880]   and a huge increase in prolactin.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.720]   - What does that do?
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.200]   - Prolactin and dopamine
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.360]   are essentially antagonistic to one another.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.240]   It creates states of quiescence, calm.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.920]   It's thought to facilitate pair bonding
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.860]   by keeping mates near one another,
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.320]   smelling one another, sharing pheromones.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.440]   In fact, there's something called the Coolidge effect.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.440]   We can talk about the sort of classic Coolidge effect.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.560]   There are these effects that have to do
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.520]   with the inverse relationship
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.120]   between dopamine and prolactin.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.480]   But with pornography,
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.360]   assuming that boys are masturbating to the pornography
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.920]   and they are doing that to the point of ejaculation,
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.720]   then they're getting this kind of quiescence of the system.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.480]   They're feeling lethargic, relaxed.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.280]   Maybe depending on their age or their motivation,
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.600]   they're doing it again and again,
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.120]   but neither the dopamine nor the prolactin
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.240]   are being devoted to anything about courtship and pursuit,
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.260]   nor is it, in the case of prolactin,
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.760]   related to anything related to pair bonding.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   They're just sitting there with their computer in their room.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.720]   And of course, this occurred with pornography,
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.600]   as you mentioned before, classic pornography.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.600]   But when I was growing up,
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.280]   if somebody had a penthouse or a Playboy magazine,
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.360]   they would often stash it, for whatever reason,
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.640]   behind a business or something
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.560]   so no one would get caught with it.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.040]   And then you'd go there like a library.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.240]   It was like a thing you'd go.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.880]   And it was in places where,
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.880]   this is getting a little weird,
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.400]   but where people didn't use the pornography there.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.880]   I think they remembered it, perhaps.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   But they weren't spending a ton of time with it,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.160]   and they weren't taking, in fact, there was an unspoken rule.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.080]   You didn't take it with you.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.600]   And this is kind of most kids' first exposure to pornography
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.280]   or their dad had a Playboy magazine or something like that.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.160]   So I hope I described the landscape of the biology
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.440]   well enough, but the short answer is,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.600]   absolutely creates major problems
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.220]   in the dopamine reinforcement system.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.500]   It's training the dopamine reinforcement system
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.080]   for fast reinforcement and diminished reinforcement
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   over time, and none of it translates to the real world.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.620]   It's not just the content.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:56.920]   So I guess what we're getting at here
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.080]   is it's not just what they're seeing is so extreme,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.920]   and that's an issue, clearly.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.680]   It's also the whole process takes minutes,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.720]   and it can be repeated over and over,
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.120]   depending on the refractory period,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.200]   as opposed to real-world dating and relationships,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.500]   which takes effort, and it takes learning.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.440]   There's hardly any learning in the use of a drug
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.900]   like methamphetamine or cocaine
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.140]   about how your dopamine system works, unconscious learning.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.500]   And there's hardly any, if any,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.220]   learning about sex and courtship in pornography.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.300]   And it's also training the dopamine system,
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.260]   the whole motivational system around sex,
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.120]   to be observational as opposed to participatory.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.100]   And I hear a lot, because I'm in the wellness health space,
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.840]   and I'm a man, guys reach out by direct message.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.680]   Hey, listen, they'll reach out
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.240]   that they're having real issues
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.440]   with erectile dysfunction, with anxiety.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.960]   And these things always existed,
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.940]   but there was a kind of a learning, a communication,
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.920]   hopefully some, you know, slow your breathing down
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.860]   and communicate and kind of get back to a place
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.560]   where you're more comfortable.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.180]   They're not able to translate anything
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.440]   about their experience of sex and pleasure
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.360]   to the real world, and as a consequence,
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:10.260]   they're retreating into a world where they view,
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.620]   if they're heterosexual, the opposite sex,
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.900]   or if they're homosexual, the same, potential partners,
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.540]   as like these distant foreign objects
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.420]   that they don't understand.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.540]   - Wow, Andrew, thank you.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.820]   That was a really powerful and clear description
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.620]   of what I was trying to say in the book
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.820]   coming just from the psychological side,
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:32.820]   which is to turn from a boy into a man,
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.420]   there's a certain amount of toughening
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.560]   and skill building, there's skills that have to be developed
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.180]   and I'm so glad to use the word courtship.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.360]   I use that word a lot with my students.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   I hear almost nobody else using that word.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.120]   It's such an important word because we did evolve
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.600]   the ability to pair bond, at least temporarily,
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.240]   and we do have courtship and it has to start slowly.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.860]   If you jump into bed and have sex right away,
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.800]   there's no chance of courtship, that part is over.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.680]   And so, you know, as you were talking,
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.200]   I was really trying to, I was thinking,
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.680]   and I want the listeners to imagine,
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:09.480]   imagine one 13 year old boy who, you know,
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.800]   really wants sex, would like to have a girlfriend,
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.000]   but he has a laptop, he has a phone, he has a porn hub,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.200]   he masturbates two or three times a day.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.840]   He'd still like to have a girlfriend,
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.320]   but he's sexually satisfied
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.520]   because he has all this amazing pornography.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.600]   And he does this every day for 10 years,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.400]   until he's 23, let's say.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.080]   And then we have another boy who, you know,
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.440]   maybe he has a Playboy magazine, or maybe he has nothing,
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.640]   maybe he just has his imagination,
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.200]   he masturbates occasionally, as boys do,
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.800]   but he doesn't have the hardcore porn,
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   he doesn't have the fast dopamine.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.640]   And then this second boy, he puts more effort
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.040]   to actually having a girlfriend,
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.460]   and he learns how to talk to girls,
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.080]   and he's flirting and one is interested in him,
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.360]   and then they have their first kiss.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.520]   And, you know, 'cause I'm remembering back when I was,
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.000]   you know, a teenager in my 20s,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.660]   the most beautiful golden days,
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.000]   I mean, the most memorable days of my life,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.320]   it was those days when you have that first kiss
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.280]   and you know like, oh, this is gonna turn into something.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.520]   Everything sparkles after that.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.520]   Yeah, everything sparkles.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:16.000]   But the point is, it's slow and it's hard work.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.680]   And then when you finally do have sex,
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.000]   you know, it's not like, oh, dopamine crashed,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.040]   you know, get out of here.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.520]   It's, as you said, it's like, ah, you know,
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:28.420]   prolactin rise, you know, you hug, you hold the girl,
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.080]   and, you know, at some point,
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.320]   you start thinking about marriage.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.000]   Like, you start thinking like, is this the one?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   I mean, you know, crazy thoughts like that,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.880]   you can't help but think that when you're falling in love.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.240]   And at NYU, I teach an undergrad course
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.880]   and I also teach an MBA course.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.600]   Now, the MBAs are all on the dating apps.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.720]   They're in their late 20s, they're all on the dating apps.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.460]   The undergrads, some of them are on dating apps,
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.360]   but they're, you know, they're 19,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.780]   they're mostly dating and they're in their circles.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.800]   And for the MBAs, I really have to work with them
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.880]   to see that these dating apps
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:59.880]   are cutting off courtship in a lot of ways.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.840]   I mean, yes, you're texting, but it's not the same.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.320]   So, I'm so glad you explained a lot about that.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.000]   One is the fast, it's the fast satisfaction
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.640]   that prevents you from learning,
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.200]   where slow, hard work towards a biological goal
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.920]   like sex or dating or marriage or love
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.480]   is what builds you up into a competent man.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.240]   Who would wanna hire, or who would wanna date,
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.200]   let's put it that way.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.080]   Who would wanna date the kid who'd been masturbating
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.880]   three times a day to porn since he was 13?
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.720]   So, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.640]   - Yeah, and there's all sorts of things.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.480]   I mean, my father's Argentine,
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.800]   moved to the States in the late 60s.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.480]   And so, I was raised in a fairly traditional home
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.840]   from the perspective of masculine, feminine roles.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.840]   And there were all these things around chivalry.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   I remember going to my first junior high school dance,
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.220]   my dad gave me this whole tutorial about holding the door
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.920]   and how to, you know, it's interesting that nowadays,
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.300]   guys are often judged in terms of their latency
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.360]   to respond to text messages.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.200]   You know, something I'm terrible at.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.220]   And it's interesting that that sort of replaced chivalry,
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.160]   like how responsive somebody is.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.920]   So, there's a kind of a bleeding for it,
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.120]   as long as we're just being very open about the past,
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.880]   present, and perhaps future of this stuff.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.800]   I remember growing up and hearing stories.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.400]   This wasn't how my childhood went,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.040]   but I remember my dad telling me, you know, in Argentina,
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.200]   the young boys, when they would hit puberty,
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.880]   used to be taken to prostitutes.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:26.320]   So, they would learn how to have sex.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.640]   I mean, that's how, I mean, that wasn't that long ago.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.760]   Okay, that wasn't my childhood.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.320]   And I remember thinking like, what's that?
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.400]   Well, you know, is this what's gonna happen next?
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.720]   But he was explaining, that's kind of how it went.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.000]   That doesn't tend to happen anymore, as I understand.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.120]   - I haven't heard of it happening.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.360]   - Right, but in terms of learning courtship,
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.520]   learning chivalry, learning, you know, who pays.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.360]   And a lot of that's changed with the, you know,
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.760]   the changing milieu of sex and gender dynamics.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.960]   But it's all iterative.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.200]   It's slow and iterative.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.240]   And everything about online use, as you mentioned,
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.400]   is it's fast.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.920]   You can find anything with a keyword search.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.060]   - No work, that's right.
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.960]   The technology makes everything easier.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.260]   And if we end up talking about AI at all,
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.400]   which every conversation goes to at some point,
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.800]   that's my big fear, that AI makes everything easy.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.020]   Now, that's great for us adults.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.880]   When we have 50 things we wanna do,
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.600]   if I can give 30 of them to AI, that would be great.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.960]   But, you know, how many servants do I want my,
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.560]   you know, my son is now 17.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.320]   When he was 10, 11, 12, how many servants
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.220]   would I want him to have to take care of his needs?
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.260]   Like, probably zero.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.220]   Like, zero is probably the best number.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:33.060]   But, you know, with porn for the sexual drive,
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.540]   with multiplayer video games for sports or competition,
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:41.040]   that's right, our kids, they're not learning or developing.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.300]   And this is why, you know, I work in a business school.
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.600]   I talk to a lot of people in the corporate world.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.440]   And I always ask them,
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.800]   how's it going with your Gen Z employees?
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:49.880]   I've never heard a good word.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.420]   I've never heard, oh, they're great.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.400]   They're often people just surprised
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.800]   at how they don't take initiative.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.600]   If, you know, if something is broken, they don't fix it.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.440]   They wanna be told what to do.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.580]   They don't have the confidence.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.840]   They're very anxious.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.440]   So, you know, I'm not ragging on Gen Z.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.920]   I'm saying we blocked their development.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.820]   We prevented them from having a thousand,
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.580]   millions of experiences of social interaction,
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.500]   of challenge, of failure, of fear, of thrill.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.580]   And then when they reach their early twenties
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.420]   and they're employed,
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.500]   employers find there's something lacking.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.340]   - So, it sounds to me like boys on smartphones,
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.840]   or sort of in this 2010 period forward,
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:34.860]   are getting this kind of hyper-stereotypical male experience.
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.820]   First-person shooter games, pornography.
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.680]   Girls are getting this hyper-stereotypical female experience.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.380]   Relational, highly relational.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:46.060]   But there are certain dynamics that are missing,
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.060]   or certain components that are missing.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.720]   Yesterday, I heard you mention something
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.040]   very, very interesting to me,
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   which is that in both groups, it seems,
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.680]   conflict and any kind of friction
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:02.920]   is not being resolved among the participants,
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.840]   but there's this sort of looking outward
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.220]   for some rule or policy, law or oversight
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.060]   to come in and intervene.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.100]   Could you talk a little bit about this?
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.460]   This relates in an interesting way to cancel culture.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.680]   - Yeah, that's right, that's right.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.140]   - I would love to learn more about this.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:16.980]   - Sure.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.780]   So, aggression is a part of human nature, as is cooperation.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.420]   And they kind of have to go together.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.440]   To make it in this world,
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.860]   you have to be able to play politics.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.620]   You have to have friends and allies.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.060]   You have to stand up for yourself.
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.580]   You have to push back sometimes,
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.460]   but you have to learn to bury the hatchet.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.560]   And if you grew up with siblings,
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   you're fighting every day and you're cooperating every day.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.660]   It's a very important practice.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.900]   And if you're playing sports outside
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.860]   with a bunch of kids in the neighborhood,
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.300]   you're making the rules every day.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.740]   And then part of what's important
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.120]   when kids are playing is the infractions.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:55.580]   The play stops, people come together.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.420]   That was out of bounds.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.260]   No, it wasn't.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.080]   You pushed me.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:58.920]   No, I didn't.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.900]   And then everybody gets practice playing judge and jury
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.500]   because everyone wants the game to go on.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.600]   So they're very motivated to work it out.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.060]   You have to accept the judgment.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.420]   What are you gonna do, storm off and go home to protest?
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:12.260]   Then you look like a loser
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.540]   and you don't get to play anymore.
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.340]   So natural play with no adult
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.500]   forces the kids to learn social skills
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.580]   that are essential for democracy.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.980]   How do we make rules together, just us?
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.400]   How do we decide how we're gonna govern ourselves?
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.820]   What do we do when it looks like someone violated a rule?
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.060]   Well, we're not just gonna kill them.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.420]   We're not gonna expel them.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.900]   We have to have a way of going on with the play.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.020]   So these are such crucial skills for social development
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.700]   for boys and for girls.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:41.100]   And kids always learn to work that out.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.320]   But what happens when the boys are growing up on video games,
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.340]   there are no disputes.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.260]   There can't be a dispute because the game,
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.660]   the software basically manages everything.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.220]   There's no out of bounds or anything.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:57.980]   So the play is missing a lot of the key skills.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:01.180]   Now, how are conflicts resolved?
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.140]   Well, on social media,
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:06.860]   instead of a conflict that two girls might have had,
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:09.420]   just the two of them or with a group before,
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.620]   which could get worked out very, very quickly,
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:13.740]   it's somebody posts something indirect.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.940]   Maybe it's an indirect criticism
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.320]   and someone takes it in a way,
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.500]   maybe it was intended that way, maybe it wasn't.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.100]   But before you know it, it's accelerated.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.460]   People are taking sides.
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.520]   It could blow up.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.720]   You don't know how big it could get.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.860]   It could be the whole school now gets drawn in.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.580]   This is terrifying.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:29.180]   So a really important idea about play
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.940]   is what's called low stakes mistakes.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:33.720]   So if you make a mistake
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:37.580]   while playing soccer with your friends, no big deal.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.720]   Like, you know, it's a foul, redo, whatever it is.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.180]   But if you make a mistake on social media,
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.980]   it could blow up to the point
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.100]   where you are now a laughing stock.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.580]   And when a kid, especially in middle school,
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.240]   when a kid is a laughing stock,
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.940]   when everyone's laughing at them,
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:56.780]   that is likely to trigger thoughts even of suicide.
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.900]   Shame makes us want to disappear.
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.820]   And we're putting our kids,
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.860]   our kids need to be immersed in small groups,
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.140]   small groups of other kids that are stable,
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.320]   somewhat stable over years.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.940]   That's the healthiest environment.
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.300]   But instead we're mixing them in
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.980]   with potentially gigantic groups, including strangers,
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:19.740]   and people who are not engaging their normal empathy skills,
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.980]   but are being performative, judgmental,
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:26.380]   judging in order to be liked by others.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.500]   So it's just an inhumane,
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.280]   it's an inhuman world in which to raise kids.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.380]   And this is part of my point about the great rewiring.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.580]   In 2010s, American kids still had a recognizable
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:39.660]   human childhood with a lot of time
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:41.020]   together with other friends.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:44.660]   But that plunges in the 2010s to the point where now
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.500]   childhood is largely happening alone on a screen.
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.580]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:52.100]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.420]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.800]   that has everything you need.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.000]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.780]   and potassium in the correct amounts and ratios,
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.060]   and nothing you don't, which means no sugar.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.780]   Now, I and others on this podcast
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.080]   have talked about the critical importance of hydration
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.660]   for proper brain and body functioning.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.580]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.080]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.380]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.380]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.560]   are critical for the functioning
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.060]   of all the cells in your body,
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.140]   especially your neurons, your nerve cells.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.600]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.960]   makes it very easy to ensure
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.740]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.320]   and adequate electrolytes.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.800]   To make sure I'm getting proper amounts
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.540]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.380]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.360]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.620]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.120]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.220]   I'll also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.140]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.500]   especially in hot days when I'm sweating a lot,
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.540]   losing water and electrolytes.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.460]   They have a bunch of different
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.140]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.700]   My favorite is the watermelon,
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.240]   although I confess I also like the raspberry and the citrus.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.280]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.760]   And Element has also just released
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.840]   a new line of canned sparkling Element.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.560]   So these aren't the packets you dissolve in water.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.920]   These are cans of Element that you crack open
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.280]   like any other canned drink, like a soda,
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.580]   but you're getting your hydration
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.480]   and your electrolytes with no sugar.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.600]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.480]   you can go to drinkelement, spelled L-M-N-T.com/huberman
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.120]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.000]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.020]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.100]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.780]   I'll never forget in middle school being at some assembly
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.780]   and a kid had got down on all fours behind me
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.500]   and someone pushed me.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.700]   - Oh yeah, I remember that.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.680]   - I stood up and Kevin Gassman was just sitting there
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.260]   just cackling with his face right in front of me.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.180]   So I hit him.
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.220]   It turns out it wasn't Kevin that did it.
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.980]   And he hit me back and it was a disaster.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.020]   And I don't remember how it panned out,
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.020]   but we ended up being friends.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.460]   So this is kind of how things got worked out.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.300]   - Well, that's right.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.780]   - And cooperation, you need the two together.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.380]   - Yeah, incredibly embarrassing,
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.240]   both for getting pushed over and for hitting the wrong kid,
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.720]   but credit for hitting somebody
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.980]   'cause that's how boys work things out.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.780]   I'm not suggesting people do this, not suggesting violence.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.580]   And then both of us feeling silly.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.060]   And then ultimately, well, I don't know,
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.140]   I made it to the eighth grade somehow, right?
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.760]   - That's right.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.480]   - And the hierarchy among, I mostly had male friends,
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.420]   but the hierarchy was something that was very dynamic.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:20.580]   I have a good friend who was a CEO,
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.420]   a commanding officer
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.180]   in one of the East Coast SEAL Team Squadrons,
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.620]   tier one SEAL Team Squadron.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.800]   He said the reason they're so effective in those groups
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.900]   is because they embrace dynamic subordination
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:33.060]   where people take over
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.300]   as different skill sets are required
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.140]   and they are relentlessly hard on each other.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.180]   This is something they are like relentlessly hard
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.540]   at the level of humor, but also, I mean,
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.540]   because it's so high risk and high consequence,
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.660]   they're just extremely hard on one another.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.020]   But it's all about this dynamic subordination
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.780]   that sure, they're leaders by virtue
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.260]   of who's appointed leader in certain amount of authority,
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.140]   but there's this constant dynamic subordination
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:00.420]   and it exists in every group of males
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.740]   I've ever been a part of.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.380]   And it's wonderful and very reassuring to me
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.700]   because it means that you both get to potentially step up,
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.540]   but you also get to rest
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.940]   and trust somebody else's skills.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.820]   I don't know how it operates with girls.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.020]   I've only been born with a white chromosome,
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.120]   this is all I know,
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.140]   but I imagined it exists there too in different,
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.140]   but in different ways.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:27.060]   So if online, everything is fear-based
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:30.360]   where one is fearing a dog pile,
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.860]   like if you say the wrong thing, you're gonna get dog pile.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.300]   You kind of wonder why anyone participates at all,
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.740]   but it seems like people are in there.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:41.380]   Are they in there and timid or is boldness rewarded?
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:45.860]   Is it only boldness of, I guess they call it,
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:46.980]   slamming down to what are they called,
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.580]   dunking on other people?
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.260]   And here as I'm describing kids,
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:54.580]   I wanna acknowledge if you look on Twitter,
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.680]   X we now call it,
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.700]   in the academic tech and finance community in particular,
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.660]   this is how the men behave.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:05.200]   This is how the women behave,
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.640]   but it's especially apparent
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.420]   that the adults are kind of acting like kids
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.580]   and the kids are kind of acting like adults.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.940]   So what's going on?
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:16.400]   Are we drawn into this as well as adults
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.340]   and are we modeling this
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:23.340]   or is this just social media pulling on these strings
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:28.020]   of deep evolutionarily conserved wiring?
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:28.860]   - Yeah.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.800]   Well, so first,
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:37.460]   let's not be too sort of monochromatic about social media.
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.220]   There is a lot of humor.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.140]   There's a lot of jokes.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.420]   There are a lot of funny cartoons and videos and learning.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.820]   So there is good stuff mixed in
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.540]   and even the bad stuff is entertaining
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.960]   in the way that looking at a car crash
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.980]   or a dead body is entertaining people.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.100]   It draws the eye.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.380]   So young people are very interested
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.680]   and us adults too are very interested.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.580]   It draws us in,
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.780]   but then yes, it certainly changes our behavior.
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:09.240]   Now, actually, there's some research on trolls.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.740]   Is it that whenever you go on Twitter, you become a jerk?
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.740]   And actually, no, it seems more
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:22.100]   that what happens is there's a small number of men,
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.980]   always men, who have a personality disorder.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.820]   They like to be jerks.
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.900]   They like to get a reaction from people.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.960]   They get blocked a lot.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.540]   They get kicked off platforms.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:37.000]   And this small number, in a real community,
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.840]   probably when you were growing up,
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.940]   there were one or two kids who were like this
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940]   and they got in trouble a lot
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.660]   and they probably ended up dead or in jail.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:47.720]   But online, suppose it's 1% of men are psychopaths.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.980]   So suppose it's this 2% of men, let's say,
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.480]   who are jerks like this.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.860]   Well, online, that's who we all see.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:59.820]   So in part, it's that the online world
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.220]   super empowers extremists and jerks.
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.500]   It's also that in the online world,
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.160]   everyone is feeling performative.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:11.180]   Everyone is, you might, even if you're making a joke,
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.580]   you have to think three steps ahead.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.020]   How will it be misinterpreted?
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:17.100]   So a metaphor that I have in my head whenever I'm online
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.300]   is it's really just like being on thin ice.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.740]   Like you can have fun on thin ice.
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.780]   It's not all bad, but you're kind of always aware
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.700]   that you're in danger.
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:27.700]   Whereas when you're hanging out with your buddies,
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.820]   you know, your good friends, you feel totally safe.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.980]   And if you accidentally insult one of them,
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.700]   you know, it's like, oh, you know, sorry.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.340]   You know, yep, you're right, I'm sorry.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:40.800]   - And as followership increases, the ice gets thinner.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.700]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.540]   That's right, you're right.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.420]   The higher they go, the harder they fall.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.540]   And then a lot of people wanna see, wanna see your fall.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.020]   Just wanna make one point.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.020]   That was an interesting concept.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.860]   There was something in subordination.
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.340]   - Dynamic subordination. - Dynamic subordination.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.820]   - Kind of like a flock of birds,
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.520]   but is how it was described to me.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.140]   But, you know, I always thought in the, you know,
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.860]   tier one special operations community that, you know,
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.580]   people would spend more years there,
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.900]   advance further and further.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.740]   And that's true too.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.260]   But this idea that it's just understood
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.860]   that the hierarchy evolves in real time.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:15.420]   And the more people embrace that,
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.660]   the better performing the group is as a pack.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:18.500]   - Yeah.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.420]   Now the word hierarchy certainly takes on a bad name,
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.020]   especially like in our academic circles.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.980]   Hierarchy, you know, is bad and power is bad.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:28.220]   And subordination, all these things are bad.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.420]   Power, you know, inequality.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.140]   But I think part of what's going on there.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.340]   So, you know, I teach in a business school
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.500]   and there's a huge amount of writing on leadership.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.060]   And I haven't read much of it.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:42.060]   But a key idea that I got, I'm trying to remember the author,
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.180]   is that the key puzzle is not why people wanna be leaders.
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.080]   It's why do they wanna be followers?
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.200]   We really need to study followership.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.920]   And so people are willing to follow
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.700]   because part of our amazing human ability
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.380]   is to work together in groups to overcome obstacles.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:58.620]   We don't have sharp teeth.
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.480]   We're not very, well, we're fast in long distance,
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.140]   but not in sprints.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.120]   But we're able to work together.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.140]   And when we face a common threat,
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:09.180]   we very willingly cede leadership to a leader,
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.980]   but we have to trust him.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.020]   And if a leader shows that he's a narcissist,
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.060]   that he's putting himself first,
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:17.480]   that he's benefiting at our expense, we don't trust him.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.900]   So what you need to do, and I think this is more clear.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.980]   Males are more hierarchical.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.420]   This is true in chimpanzees as well.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.520]   Males are, they take to hierarchy more readily.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.660]   Males benefit from having practice.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.740]   I don't think of it as dominance and submission.
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.020]   I think what you said is actually more effective.
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.060]   It's like they need practice,
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.820]   like being the leader of this project
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.860]   and then being a follower because you grant,
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.080]   like, yeah, you lead us on this.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.260]   You take the lead on this.
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:45.160]   And then something else will reverse.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.780]   And if you have a young man who has a lot of that experience
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.500]   that's gonna be a young man that you will wanna employ
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.140]   when he's in his mid-twenties.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.480]   Whereas one who never had that,
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.180]   it's just gonna be much more difficult to work with
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.800]   in a business setting.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.500]   - Yeah, the groups of boys I grew up with
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.780]   and men that I've worked with and been friends with,
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.820]   it's always been understood,
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:05.940]   like this guy's really terrific for finding stuff.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:07.580]   And this guy's great with vehicles.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.740]   And this guy's great with girls.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:12.940]   And this guy's, that people have different skillsets
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:15.720]   and that the group together can really mesh.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.460]   But there isn't an attempt to be something that you're not.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.140]   And you quickly find out who you are
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.500]   by who you're not and you find your unique skillset.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   And you evolve in that way
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.940]   by not trying to be everything to everybody.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.320]   Whereas I noticed with my sister and her groups of friends,
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.880]   it's changed over time, of course,
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.840]   but that there tended to be one girl
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.900]   that was really dominant in the play session,
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.420]   like the whole time, the bossy one.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.260]   - You're right.
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:47.740]   - And even though some stories,
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.920]   kids' books that mainly feature boys have that.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.640]   I don't recall that being such a big part
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.500]   of my reading experience or childhood experience,
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.140]   like in the Encyclopedia Brown books,
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.060]   like there was like the mean kid.
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:05.120]   But people would slot in where they were most adept.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.020]   So it was sort of like natural tendencies to excel
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.220]   were complimentary.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.660]   And I don't know what it is for girls,
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:14.420]   but online, it seems, all of that's erased.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.960]   So you've got these social dynamics
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.680]   that are very heightened,
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.840]   being played out on social media with girls.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.800]   But boys and men are on there as well.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.760]   And most of what's on social media is social,
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.940]   it's relational.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.660]   So are boys and men being drawn more
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.380]   toward those sorts of interactions
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.760]   and how well are they navigating those interactions?
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.600]   Is it common for boys to make big mistakes online
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.680]   and then be shunned as a consequence?
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.680]   Or is this more common in females?
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.720]   - Yeah, no, that's a good question.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.340]   Life online is performative.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.240]   For girls, a much bigger element of the performance
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.880]   is perfectionism about the image.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.480]   So girls spend a lot more time choosing a photograph,
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.500]   editing a photograph, making sure everything's perfect.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.440]   Whereas guys, like I literally don't notice
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.660]   if my socks don't match.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.140]   My wife has to tell me, "Your socks don't match."
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.860]   Guys just don't notice those things as much.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.460]   - You're a professor after all.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.340]   - Yeah, I'm a professor, I suppose.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.100]   But my point is that life online, it does affect all kids.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.240]   So fear of missing out is something that affects everybody.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.020]   On Snapchat, you see all your friends are over there
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.220]   and you didn't even know that there was something going on.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.300]   So again, boys and girls, they'll have similar insecurities.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.500]   It's more a question of degree.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.820]   So the perfectionism, the playing out the social dynamics
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.620]   to three steps, like girls are playing three-dimensional
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.940]   chess about social relationships.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:48.940]   Well, but why did he say that if he also wanted this
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.560]   when she, he knows that, she knows that,
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.400]   and guys are like, "What?
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.220]   "What are you saying?
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.500]   "I don't even know what you're saying."
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.520]   - They're barely playing checkers.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.360]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.700]   And again, it's the organizing effects
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.580]   of prenatal hormones.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.220]   This is not culturally taught.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.700]   This is what kids enjoy doing based on, I believe,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.180]   and Simon Baron Cohen, I believe, believes,
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:13.860]   is the prenatal organizing effects of hormones
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.500]   on the developing brain.
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:16.860]   - But on YouTube, where it's,
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:19.080]   my understanding, primarily male,
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.900]   there's a lot of clap back type comments.
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.500]   I know this 'cause I have a YouTube channel.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.760]   And in the old days, it wasn't that long ago,
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.960]   when Rogan had full length episodes on YouTube,
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.860]   then he didn't, now he does again.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:37.180]   The jokes, the comment section on YouTube
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.340]   were like their own show.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:40.220]   It was outrageous.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.260]   It was so good.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.420]   And some of that's coming back now that he's-
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.660]   - Was it men showing off their cleverness?
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.500]   - Right.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.320]   I mean, like, for instance,
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.540]   you might be familiar with Jocko Willink, right?
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.700]   If you had to draw a Navy SEAL, you draw Jocko.
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.860]   Kind of looks like modern day General Patton, right?
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:00.100]   And there's this whole category of jokes based on Jocko,
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.180]   who I think actually has risen to prominence
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.060]   in the online culture
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.580]   because he's sort of like the football coach
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.060]   that most young males never had.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.260]   He's the guy that's gonna tell you what to do,
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.940]   when to do it, and do it even though you don't want to,
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:11.780]   and just do it.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.100]   And you trust him.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.880]   He's a very trustworthy guy, as it were.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.020]   And he's a warrior and he has all the credentials, et cetera.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.660]   But there's this whole category of jokes.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.740]   Like, when Jocko was born,
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.220]   the doctor looked at his mother and said, "It's a man."
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.180]   (Zubin laughs)
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.140]   Or when Jocko left for college,
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.280]   he looked at his father and said,
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.300]   "You're the man of the house now."
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.060]   Jokes like that, there are tons and tons of these, right?
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.140]   So there's this whole- - Oh, yeah.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.460]   - So that's very YouTube-ish male type humor.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.580]   It's one hit, it's done, it gets a ton of likes,
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.060]   and it propagates.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.500]   None of this two or three chess moves down the road.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.540]   So it's very clap back sometimes,
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.700]   or in that case, building up Jocko,
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.780]   who doesn't need any more building up,
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.000]   but people do it anyway.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.660]   So things of that sort.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.380]   So I'm interested in the nuance here
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:01.100]   because you're telling me
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.820]   that girls are killing themselves more.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.700]   They're depressed.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.880]   - Their increase in suicide is larger.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.040]   Boys have a much higher suicide rate.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.740]   So many more boys die from suicide.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.660]   - Because they put more violent means.
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.280]   - That's one of the major reasons,
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.620]   and that's especially true in America
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.060]   where we have so many guns.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.740]   Boys tend to use a gun or a tall building or a bridge,
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.980]   whereas girls tend to use pills or cutting their wrists,
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.260]   and the great majority of girls' suicide attempts
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.580]   don't lead to death.
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:30.260]   - So are most of the issues with girls
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:33.040]   and online use, social media,
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.860]   it's sort of, it's despair.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:40.460]   It's at home, anxious, sad about self,
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.660]   self-critiquing, this kind of thing.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.340]   I mean, you're telling me there's a huge,
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.180]   and I believe you,
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.740]   that there's a tremendous increase.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.780]   I mean, it's a hockey stick-like function.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:54.460]   When we're looking at essentially capturing
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.660]   the tip of the pyramid in terms
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.700]   of like extreme social interaction.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.300]   So take, let me, I'm not being very clear here.
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.220]   We have these neural circuits
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.940]   that evolved for social interactions
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.540]   that are more heightened in girls.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:10.020]   They're getting much more of it faster,
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.300]   and the consequences are no less
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.100]   and probably even more severe than they used to be,
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.860]   but it's still shunning, shaming,
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:21.700]   self-attack, and anxiety, depression, et cetera.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.880]   In boys, the neural circuits that we're talking about
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.780]   are related to sex and violence.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.100]   Those evolved over hundreds of thousands,
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.940]   not millions of years, and those are heightened.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:35.500]   So we're sort of capturing the extremes
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.140]   of these neural circuit functions.
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.020]   I'm looking at this through the lens of a neurobiologist.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:39.860]   - No, this is great.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.800]   - And this is where it seems we're running into trouble
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.580]   because the iceberg below all of that,
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.700]   the portion of the iceberg below those peaks
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.020]   of behavior and interactions,
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.980]   like none of that's happening.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.700]   There isn't the, it's all happening faster,
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:59.800]   it's more potent, and the consequences are more severe.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.640]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.760]   I think there's a good analogy here to junk food
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.080]   where I've heard junk food or a cheeseburger
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.840]   described as a super stimulus,
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:10.360]   and ice cream is a super duper stimulus.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.000]   It's got fat, it's got sugar.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.520]   - Right, and a cheeseburger with a milkshake,
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.600]   and the milkshake has candy in it.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.440]   - Yeah, ice cream.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.400]   - And then you get a toy, and they're playing music.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.620]   I mean, that's a dopamine bath.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.460]   - That's right.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:27.240]   So if we think about life in the presence of junk food,
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.900]   if you raise your kids with junk food,
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.140]   you're gonna have all kinds of metabolic problems,
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.200]   developmental problems, obesity, all sorts of diabetes,
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.320]   all sorts of terrible things.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.060]   Now, if you have a normal development,
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.760]   and then as an adult, you indulge in more junk food,
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.620]   it's not good for you,
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.380]   but it's very different than being raised on it.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.620]   The developing brain, the developing body
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:48.700]   are much more sensitive.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.700]   And so the way you just put it before,
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.300]   it's like these evolved motives,
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.660]   you super satisfy them
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:58.020]   with these overwhelming quick, easy hits.
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.340]   It may not be so bad for an adult.
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.780]   We can choose to have, we can choose to pay for sex.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:09.780]   We can choose to eat a cheeseburger and a milkshake,
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.500]   but it's very important for kids.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.940]   We have to see the genes
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.060]   don't have that much information in them,
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:17.420]   but they start the brain developing,
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.740]   and then the brain has to sort of find its way.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.580]   The neurons have to find their way,
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.540]   guided by local signals, how to develop.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.520]   And then the child has to kind of find its way
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.140]   through its culture,
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.140]   getting a sense of how do I behave here?
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:30.100]   And who am I?
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.580]   And how do I relate to people?
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.180]   And it's all a very delicate process
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:36.220]   that has to be drawn out over many, many years.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.780]   Everything about us develops slowly,
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.100]   especially compared to other animals.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.580]   And if you intervene in the developmental process and say,
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:45.460]   "Hey kid, you want the end point without the journey?
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.400]   "Here you go, take it."
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.940]   You're cutting off development.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:50.660]   And that's, I think, what life,
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:53.500]   that's what the phone-based childhood is doing.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.820]   - Well, here's my concern.
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:58.100]   There is a reality to these things
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.940]   we call critical or sensitive periods.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.640]   - Yes, let's talk about that.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.260]   - Critical periods implies that it's open and shut,
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.620]   and they're actually sensitive periods
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.620]   for language learning, for brain plasticity.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.980]   And the general contour of this is passive experience,
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.580]   up until about age 25,
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.980]   dramatically shapes the maps in the brain that we have
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:17.840]   of social relationships, of the visual world,
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.680]   the auditory world.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.400]   I mean, there's just so much data to support this
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.420]   in animals and humans.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:25.180]   Then after about age 25,
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:30.180]   you can pry open the underlying neurobiological mechanisms
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.580]   for neuroplasticity, and you can rewire your brain,
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.220]   but it takes a hell of a lot of effort
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:36.060]   and/or pharmacology to assist,
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.140]   which is part of what the excitement
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.860]   about some of the psychedelic therapies are about.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.460]   Because, and I'm not suggesting people just run out
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.580]   and take psychedelics, but-
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:45.860]   - But they can foster change.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:46.980]   - They can foster change,
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.740]   and they're either neuromodulators,
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.960]   or they stimulate the massive release of neuromodulators,
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.260]   like dopamine, serotonin, mostly serotonin and dopamine,
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:57.160]   when we talk about psilocybin and MDMA, LSD, et cetera.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:00.180]   But the plasticity needs to be directed,
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.100]   so just taking the drug doesn't do it on its own.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:05.220]   Okay, so leaving that aside, what do we know for sure?
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:09.420]   We know that as the brain progresses from age three,
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:10.580]   four, five, six, seven,
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.220]   there are milestones that have to be met.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:17.340]   And in general, if a kid makes it to high school age
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.380]   or college age, regardless of whether or not they go to,
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.480]   hopefully they do, and graduate high school or college,
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.260]   there's a set of milestones that they have to reach.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:29.060]   The circuits are going to develop one way or another.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:32.180]   The question is, what are the thresholds
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.560]   under which dopamine is released?
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:37.060]   Well, I would argue, and I'll go on record saying
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.220]   that if a kid watches a lot of intense,
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.820]   high-potency, violent porn,
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:46.140]   and that becomes his dopamine stimulus,
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.100]   well, then other stuff probably won't do it for him.
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.580]   Whereas if there's a variety of experience
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.460]   or more, let's just say subtle,
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.840]   dare I even say healthier, right, stimuli,
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.460]   then the system is, the dopamine system
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.820]   around courting and sex is more varied.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.060]   It's more of a, at least more of a buffet
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.300]   and hopefully a healthier buffet, right?
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.320]   Again, no judgment here of different proclivities,
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.680]   but here we're talking about the wiring of neural circuits.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.500]   Same thing with food.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.760]   If one grows up on highly processed,
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.400]   very, very tasty food, for a while,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.320]   fruits and vegetables in their pure form,
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.360]   meat and fish in their plain form are boring.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.880]   It does not evoke the same reinforcing property.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.280]   And earlier, I forgot to mention why I prefer the word
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.760]   reinforcing as opposed to reward,
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.360]   because reward evokes this idea
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.960]   of the thing being the reward.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.560]   But the reinforcement is, reinforcement is a verb.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:43.880]   And so as a verb, it brings the mind to the fact
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.400]   that these circuits are like,
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.640]   they're churning in the background there.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.280]   It's not just about getting the thing.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:52.840]   It's the underlying biology that gets you there.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.600]   And so I think that where I'm very concerned
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.720]   is that we've now got, what, millions and millions of kids,
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.720]   boys and girls, whose neural circuits were wired up wrong.
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.320]   And now there needs to be, it seems,
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:10.800]   a very active process in unwiring that,
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.760]   or at least shifting those neural circuits
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.360]   towards something that's more adaptive.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.280]   - Yeah, so before we talk about what to do if you're older,
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.480]   because I have the great good fortune
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.500]   to be sitting here with you right now,
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.060]   I'd like to ask you to help me expand
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.320]   what I say in the book.
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:30.480]   So you gave a description of critical periods
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.440]   where there's a hard beginning and end.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.540]   And of sensitive periods are periods
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.560]   in which it's just a lot easier to learn something.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.400]   And if you don't learn, so for example,
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.040]   phonology is one of the clearest cases.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.120]   You accent, you know, if you, you know,
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.800]   when a family moves to America from somewhere else,
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.000]   if you've got two kids in the family,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.560]   like one of my advisors at Penn in grad school,
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.320]   Henry Gleitman had a very, very heavy German accent.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.000]   And his younger brother, two years younger,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.180]   had no accent whatsoever because Henry was 14
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.100]   and his brother was 12 when they came to America
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:00.540]   from fleeing Nazi Germany.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.800]   And so there's a sensitive period
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.240]   that kind of closes at puberty for language.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.380]   So I talk about that in the book.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:09.080]   And then I talk about more speculative sensitive period
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.120]   that I've read about, you know,
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.400]   a few people think this exists.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.680]   And I cite a Japanese study of Japanese businessmen
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.320]   who moved to California in the '70s
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.280]   as Japanese businesses were thriving.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.840]   They looked at when did the kids come to feel American?
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.840]   And the answer was, if they came and left before age nine,
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.240]   nothing, they went back to Japan,
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.840]   they were totally Japanese.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.040]   If they came when the kid was 15, nothing,
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.160]   the kid was already Japanese
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.140]   but wasn't gonna ever feel American.
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:40.340]   If they came and spent a few years between about nine and 15
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:42.120]   then they go back to Japan.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.360]   Now, especially if the kid's now 15 or 16,
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.560]   the kid now feels American and has trouble fitting back in.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.400]   - Puberty.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.220]   - Well, that's right.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.400]   There's a period, it's early puberty.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.440]   It's like just before puberty
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.800]   to sort of midway through puberty.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.940]   Seems to be a sensitive period for culture learning
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.500]   and for identity.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.000]   Your very deep sense of who you are
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.680]   and how you relate to people.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.240]   So this is speculative
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.200]   but it does seem to fit a lot of interesting data.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.620]   And the reason why I focus on this in the book,
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:13.000]   I decided like late in the process,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.240]   I knew I had to talk about puberty.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.080]   I was gonna have like a section on it.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.200]   I realized, oh my God, this is so important.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.540]   I did a whole chapter on puberty.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.760]   And I talk about initiation rights all over the world.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.280]   Adults think kids don't just turn into men and women,
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.600]   they need help.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.340]   They need to be given a special knowledge.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:35.020]   For boys, there's usually ordeals more so than for girls.
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:36.380]   And so I think what's going on
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.460]   is we do have this sensitive period for culture learning.
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:40.880]   How do you learn to become a person in your culture?
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.900]   And I was in the Boy Scouts
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.300]   and Boy Scouts was created around World War I
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.540]   as like paramilitary training.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.140]   Like learn virtues of self-denial
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:52.220]   and brave, clean, loyal, trustworthy, reverent.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.380]   I've got the order all messed up
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.520]   but it was a set of virtues.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.580]   So would you agree or what would you say
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.700]   about sensitive periods for this really high level stuff?
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.700]   We're not talking vision or phenology
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.700]   which are fairly low level cognitive things.
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.980]   We're talking like your sense of who you are.
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:10.220]   What would you think about a sensitive period for that?
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:13.500]   - First of all, puberty is just fascinating
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.820]   and under discussed in my opinion
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.460]   as a critical developmental milestone.
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.820]   It's also the fastest rate of aging that we ever undergo.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:23.500]   - Aging meaning-- - In our life span.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.620]   In terms of change of the brain,
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:30.260]   in terms of rate of, I mean, there are some theories
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:34.860]   that the rate of puberty and the timing of onset of puberty
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:37.220]   actually might predict something about longevity.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:38.060]   - Oh, which way?
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.140]   Early puberty is bad. - Early puberty might be bad
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.740]   but I wanna be very careful in saying that some people,
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:44.660]   including myself, have a very protracted puberty.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.620]   So I hit puberty around 14
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.140]   but I didn't get facial hair until I was out of college.
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:50.460]   So some people develop
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.060]   the so-called secondary sexual characteristics slowly
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:55.580]   but I always had this voice since I was a little kid.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.900]   So at five years old, they call me froggy.
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:00.300]   Now that's me and everyone goes
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.300]   through these things differently
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.860]   but puberty is the most profound brain change
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.140]   that one can undergo.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:07.940]   - Tell me more about it 'cause I just keep saying like,
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:09.500]   well, it starts in the back of the brain
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.460]   and then it's, but be specific.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.460]   What is happening to the brain during puberty
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.420]   that would be relevant here to a sensitive period?
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:17.020]   - Okay, so this goes back to the biology
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:18.760]   that you accurately described earlier,
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.540]   which is that while we're in utero,
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.260]   if there's a Y chromosome,
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.660]   then a bunch of genes are made
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.420]   like mullerian inhibiting hormone.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.940]   The mullerian ducts become inhibited,
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.580]   the testes grow, then testosterone is secreted
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.260]   and testosterone and some of its derivatives
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:36.500]   like dihydrotestosterone organize the brain,
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.940]   quote unquote, male.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:39.780]   This is dangerous language nowadays.
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:41.500]   - It's less dangerous now than it was two years ago.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.000]   - Okay, well, we're not talking about gender,
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.700]   we're talking about biological sex here
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:45.940]   and we're not talking about the verb sex,
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:46.940]   we were talking about that earlier,
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.800]   we're talking about biological sex.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:53.180]   So what I'm describing here is not disputed.
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:56.740]   So there are these organizing effects of hormones early on
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:58.660]   and then there are the activating effects of hormones
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:25:59.620]   that happen during puberty.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:01.140]   So then puberty hits,
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:04.060]   the testes start secreting testosterone.
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.260]   If there are fat stores on the body, they secrete estrogen.
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.460]   Again, testosterone and estrogen working in parallel.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:11.720]   And in males, a number of different brain areas,
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.140]   in particular, the hypothalamus,
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:16.660]   but also the forebrain and associated areas
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:20.540]   undergo massive plasticity and growth relating the--
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.500]   - Wait, the forebrain, the frontal lobe?
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:23.660]   - Right, the frontal lobe.
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.700]   Oh, so one of the most profound changes in puberty
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:29.740]   that happens, especially in males, but also in females,
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.980]   is that, well, we can describe the major function
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:32.980]   of the prefrontal cortex,
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.060]   this neural real estate right behind the forebrain.
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.260]   It has many different subdomains involved in things,
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.820]   but one of its main functions,
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:40.860]   this was beautifully described by the guy
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.060]   who's now the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink,
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:45.660]   Matt McDougall, is to say, shh,
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:47.460]   to the impulse driving actions
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.260]   of the hypothalamus in particular.
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:53.020]   Hypothalamus houses neurons for temperature regulation,
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.540]   sexual drive, hunger, aggression.
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:57.820]   I mean, so much so that you can go in
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.080]   and stimulate certain neurons
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.140]   in the ventromedial hypothalamus with an electrode,
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:03.340]   and you would go into a rage.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:05.180]   Stimulate neurons also within
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.820]   the ventromedial hypothalamus, just nearby,
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:11.360]   and you'd want to go spend some time with your wife alone.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.260]   Let's just put it that way.
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.020]   I mean, a remarkable specificity of the neuronal outputs
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:18.220]   to behavioral change and state change.
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:21.700]   So all of that gets set up essentially during puberty
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.340]   because the neurons of the hypothalamus
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.660]   are responsive to these hormones
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:25.940]   that are coming from the gonads.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:29.060]   And in females, it's, yes, mainly secretion of estrogen,
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.180]   but also testosterone.
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:35.140]   Okay, so the brain is changing in dramatic ways,
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.540]   not the least of which is the forebrain
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.580]   is learning how to suppress impulse, okay?
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.980]   And some of that gets feedback from behaviors,
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.700]   from parenting, learning how to suppress
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.540]   from social reward or punishment.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:49.620]   It doesn't get daily practice in suppressing
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:51.700]   if you're able to give in to all your urges.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:53.940]   'Cause like I'm finding, like when I sit at my computer,
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.260]   my rule now, I have to say to myself out loud,
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.620]   finish what you start, finish what you start.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.900]   No, don't go check until you've done,
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.420]   you only have two more pages to read.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:05.140]   Read those two pages, but I can't do it.
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:08.180]   - Right, well, this is the gradual creep of sort of a,
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.700]   we don't want to make it clinical,
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:12.600]   but an adult like ADHD like symptoms
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.340]   that we all are suffering from, right?
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:17.060]   There's just, it's just, we're at a buffet, right?
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:19.540]   - Yeah, that's right, that's a good example.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.740]   - So that's one of the main things,
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:24.420]   this forebrain to hypothalamic wiring.
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:26.740]   The other is, and this is not trivial,
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.900]   and you mentioned the context of language learning
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:31.620]   and Dr. Eddie Chang, who's a neurosurgeon,
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.340]   actually chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.340]   knows a lot about this and critical periods,
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.780]   is that there are hormone effects on say,
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.600]   like thickening of the vocal cords,
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.820]   which is why on average boys have deeper voices
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.380]   than girls and so forth.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:45.460]   And there's a lot of feedback from those signals
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.220]   in terms of the social world,
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:50.260]   because now a young boy whose voice deepens,
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:52.700]   who's also acquiring more knowledge,
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:54.460]   is talking to other people about that knowledge
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:55.620]   and he's being treated differently
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.740]   and there's feedback in terms of his self-concept.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.420]   And that's where it gets kind of high level abstract.
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:04.380]   In girls, there's feedback of sometimes it's bodily changes,
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.780]   positive or negative feedback from peers,
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.540]   other girls and or boys, but also knowledge.
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:12.820]   She's out there talking about, well, you know,
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:15.540]   like she's brilliant in math or, you know,
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.740]   brilliant in literature and getting the feedback
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:20.100]   and then self-knowledge starts to accumulate.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:23.540]   And the location of identity in the brain is unclear.
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:25.260]   It's probably a distributed network.
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.600]   It's probably an emergent property
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.020]   of a lot of different things.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.460]   So we can't really point to one area,
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.860]   but it's learning impulse control,
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:33.380]   reinforcement contingencies.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.620]   On what timescale can I get what I want
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.360]   to meet certain drives?
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.840]   And to what extent should I suppress those drives?
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.060]   And, you know, traditionally it was, I think,
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:45.980]   through religion and parenting and social cues
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.100]   that you learn, well, if I want something,
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.180]   is it okay to do it?
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.060]   That there are consequences to eating more or less,
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:53.940]   consequences to be, okay, so it's super complex.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.860]   But that all happens sometimes in a summer.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.420]   This is what's so amazing about puberty to me, you know,
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:03.500]   or the acquisition of facial hair in a boy, you know,
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.220]   suddenly he's looked at differently.
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.380]   People will start projecting all sorts of futures on him,
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:09.940]   you know, but we do this.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:12.140]   I noticed, I'm not a child psychologist, obviously,
[01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:17.140]   but as soon as my niece started drawing,
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.780]   she's going to be an artist.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.020]   As soon as a boy starts building or a girl starts,
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.740]   you know, gets a math problem right,
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.700]   she's going to be a mathematician.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.180]   I mean, we project all this stuff
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:30.260]   and there's no question that that feeds back on identity.
[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.560]   But in terms of online use,
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.220]   I can't even imagine how much of this is diminished
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.060]   by only showing a specific part of ourselves.
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:43.660]   And I can't even imagine how much of it is exacerbated
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:46.020]   in terms of what we are rewarded for during puberty.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.880]   So here's what we know in both animals and humans,
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.700]   which is that neuroplasticity,
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:54.220]   while it responds to punishment, is exquisitely sensitive,
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.680]   becomes sort of a runaway train for more plasticity
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.640]   under conditions of dopamine reinforcement and reward.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.460]   So you can imagine that the girl using the filter,
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:04.900]   the Instagram filter for who gets rewarded
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.060]   for looking a certain way,
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.700]   maybe excessively thin or something,
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.380]   or what leads to excessively thin,
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:13.380]   there's no question that rewards
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.140]   drive neuroplasticity faster than punishment.
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.380]   - Make sure I understand this.
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:22.380]   You're saying, suppose a girl gets onto Instagram
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.420]   and she's now consuming stuff about being thin.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.360]   And for some reason she finds this rewarding.
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.620]   Are you saying that the quick dopamine circuits
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.140]   where she posts something and she gets likes for it,
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.900]   are you saying that that actually
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.900]   will extend neuroplasticity?
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.660]   The fact that she's getting more rapid dopamine,
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.220]   that will make her more neuroplastic
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:43.220]   and her brain will change more?
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:45.940]   - Yes, it will accelerate learning
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:49.140]   for whatever contingency led to that, whatever led to that.
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.540]   So we know this in animals and humans,
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.980]   even though they're exquisitely sensitive,
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:57.020]   plasticity is exquisitely sensitive to punishment.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:58.540]   You know, it only takes one shock learning
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.060]   in one corner of a cage,
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.260]   or getting sick at one particular restaurant
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.160]   that you don't wanna go back again.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.820]   But when it comes to social dynamics,
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:10.860]   we know that reward leads to almost
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.180]   what I would call runaway plasticity in the circuits
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:15.740]   that generated the behaviors
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.820]   that led to that particular reward.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:20.100]   I mean, and there are a number of experiments
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:23.860]   that explain this, the work of Mike Merzenich at UCSF,
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:25.860]   who largely worked on adult plasticity,
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:29.760]   but showed that when you activate dopamine release
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.060]   in the brain, fortunately, both during development,
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.520]   but also in adulthood,
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   you essentially create a window of super plasticity.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   - Okay, that's amazing. - So dopamine reward,
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.240]   that neuromodulator is a window for super plasticity,
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.620]   and evolutionarily, it makes sense.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:47.440]   Like, oh my goodness, there's abundance here of something.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.800]   - Time to learn something new. - That's right.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:50.440]   We've overemphasized the extent
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.460]   to which plasticity is driven by punishment,
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:56.680]   but the neuromodulators that allow for plasticity,
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.520]   in particular in puberty and as adults,
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.400]   are largely dopamine dependent and acetylcholine dependent,
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:08.280]   the acetylcholine generally increases focus,
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.280]   broadly speaking.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.280]   I mean, it does a bunch of other things,
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:11.920]   controls muscular contraction, et cetera.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.440]   But so what we're basically saying here is that
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:19.440]   if a kid gets a strongly reinforcing experience,
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:25.280]   I'd be willing to bet both arms that the neural circuits
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.280]   that help generate whatever behaviors led to that experience
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:33.120]   are going to be strengthened in one trial,
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.720]   to the extent that it will be very easy
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.000]   to generate those behaviors again.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.480]   - Okay, so, okay, thank you.
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.040]   This is exactly what I wanted to know,
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.840]   to deepen the theorizing that I do in the book.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.280]   So now this is actually the perfect time
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.520]   for us to switch over to the four main recommendations,
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.280]   because they build exactly on what you just said,
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.880]   and they help me explain why this is so important.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:59.360]   So I think one reason why the book
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.560]   seems to be doing very well,
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.560]   and people seem to like it and pass it on,
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.920]   is that it's not just doom and gloom.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.520]   It's not just, oh, we've messed up our kids,
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.360]   oh, these terrible devices.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.300]   Rather, it's about a vision of childhood,
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:11.400]   which is actually beautiful.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.920]   It's the one that most of us older people had,
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.880]   it's with play outdoors and all.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.640]   And so my analysis in the book
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.840]   is that the reason why it got this far
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.560]   is because it's a set of collective action traps.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.720]   Everyone, every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now,
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.600]   because every other 10-year-old has one,
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.240]   and you don't want to make your kid be alone.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.680]   So the four recommendations I have
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.200]   are four ways of breaking out on the trap,
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.680]   but the first two are really about delaying
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.960]   and getting past this period of plasticity.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.240]   And you really helped me see why it's so urgent
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.180]   to delay until late puberty, at least.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:48.520]   So here are the four norms
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:51.000]   that I think can break us out of this trap.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.660]   Norm number one, no smartphone before high school.
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.160]   You can give your kid a flip phone,
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.540]   the millennials had flip phones, they came out fine.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.560]   - No access or no smartphone?
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.280]   - Your own, your own, you can't have your own.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.940]   And that would even go for an iPad,
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.560]   if you give your kid an iPad and say,
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.680]   "Here, Billy, this is your iPad.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.280]   "You can keep it in your room
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   "and use it anywhere in the house.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:13.420]   "And you can take it outside even,
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:15.800]   "although maybe no Wi-Fi, whatever."
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.920]   The point is the internet is an amazing thing,
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.040]   and you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:22.960]   when you have young kids
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.440]   and they can do things on the computer,
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.800]   but you do not want to give your child
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.680]   the entire internet in his or her pocket,
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.360]   and you do not want the entire world
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:35.520]   to be able to reach your child whenever they want to.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:39.400]   So it's just insane that we're giving children,
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.380]   even before puberty, a smartphone.
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:44.040]   Let them have a flip phone or a simple phone,
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.100]   watch something like that, that's rule number one.
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:47.280]   Rule number two is the most relevant
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.360]   for what we're just talking about,
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.360]   and that is no social media until 16.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.440]   There is, I believe,
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.240]   no way to make social media safe for children.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.840]   That is, if they're going to be entering a domain
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.040]   in which prestige is gained by having posts
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.040]   that get the most likes and followers,
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.520]   you're making them be brand managers,
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.880]   you're making them be performative.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.320]   This is not playful.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.040]   They're gonna be exposed to horrible, horrible things.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.040]   I now ask young people,
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.920]   "Is there something that you saw when you were young
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.080]   "that you really regret seeing?"
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.920]   And a lot of them have an answer.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.160]   My 21-year-old doorman just told me about The Gauntlet,
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.000]   running The Gauntlet.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.140]   It's a series of 20 videos.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:23.280]   It's a challenge.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.720]   Can you watch these 20 videos,
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.060]   which end with a Mexican drug gang
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:30.040]   dismembering a person who's alive?
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:30.920]   It's things like that.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.280]   Like, "Yes, I'm tough enough.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.120]   "I can do that."
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:33.960]   Really?
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:34.860]   At what age should you,
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:37.200]   do you want your kids watching people being dismembered?
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.040]   10, 11?
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:38.860]   Is that okay? - Oh, and those images
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.820]   are forever. - They're forever.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:40.660]   That's right.
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:41.480]   That's right.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.320]   I didn't even watch the video.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.160]   You know what?
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:43.980]   I'm sorry I said that.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:44.820]   - No, we won't provide a link.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:45.800]   No, I'll say that, you know,
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.060]   trauma is defined as an adverse event
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.720]   that forever changes the way the brain responds
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:53.120]   in ways that make people less effective in life.
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.520]   So don't do it to yourself.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.080]   Like, I wouldn't watch the "Dalmer" movie.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.000]   Everyone was talking about the "Dalmer" movie.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.300]   All I had to see was 10 seconds of the trailer
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.440]   to know I'll pay money not to see that.
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.280]   - That's right.
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.120]   - Not because I couldn't get through it.
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.280]   I'm sure I could force myself to,
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.320]   but I don't want that in my neural real estate.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.160]   - That's right.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.880]   - It's just, for obvious reasons.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:14.160]   - So let's go back to what you said about neuroplasticity.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:18.780]   So, because if it's true that puberty is a sensitive period
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:22.360]   for many higher level aspects of our humanity,
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.380]   such as identity, relationship skills,
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:27.580]   all that stuff, then you should be extra careful.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:30.120]   When your kids are nine to 15 years old,
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.520]   you should be extra careful
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:33.280]   about what's going into their eyes and ears.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.260]   And instead, that's when we give up all control.
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.100]   You know, when our kids are little,
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.520]   they pay attention to us.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.360]   We read to them.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.800]   We have a lot of control about what our kids consume
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.880]   when they're toddlers and when they're very young.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.760]   But as they reach middle school and high school,
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:44.600]   they're moving away.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.560]   They're seeking out other stuff.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.960]   And that's exactly when we say,
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.680]   here, here's your own device.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.360]   You wanna go down a rabbit hole of eating disorder stuff?
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:57.360]   You wanna go down a rabbit hole of Tourette's syndrome?
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:00.540]   You're gonna copy people who have these symptoms?
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.380]   So, the last thing we should be doing
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:05.740]   is exposing our children in this sensitive period
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:08.300]   to socializing information from random weirdos
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.300]   on the internet who were selected by an algorithm
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.020]   for the extremity of their behavior
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:14.980]   and the degree to which that extremity earned them likes,
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.660]   which makes them extra prestigious.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:22.100]   So, yeah, laws that raise the age to 16 or 18,
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.660]   I think that's what we need.
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:25.660]   This is just not appropriate for minors.
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.260]   Even if there's some good stuff on it,
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.180]   I think it's vastly outweighed by the bad.
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:30.460]   So, that's the second norm.
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.360]   No social media till 16.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.700]   The third norm is phone-free schools.
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:38.900]   And again, we expect kids to learn
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:40.100]   and learning is brain change.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:41.980]   If you're learning something, you're developing a skill,
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:44.380]   something about your brain has changed.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.620]   How about instead of learning math or reading
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.940]   or litter or anything else,
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:51.660]   how about if you just do more phone stuff?
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:54.260]   You just spend more time in school on TikTok.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:56.660]   There was just an article in the Wall Street Journal
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:58.300]   about a teacher who fought against the phones
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.140]   and finally gave up and quit.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.620]   And one of the students in his class has quoted
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:07.700]   that she'd come into class and she would just go on TikTok
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.300]   and that's what she would do all class long,
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:10.900]   is just watch TikTok in her desk.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:14.140]   And like, no, you should be learning,
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.500]   not doing more TikTok in school.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.340]   So, it's just insane that we let kids take
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.500]   the greatest distraction devices ever invented
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.820]   into the classroom with them.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:22.660]   And they can't help it. - And I would argue
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:25.380]   that they are learning, but what they're learning
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:29.060]   are these rapidly reinforced dopamine loops
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:31.840]   that lead to diminished amounts of dopamine,
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.920]   not just in short periods of time, but very quickly,
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:37.500]   and that inhibit other forms of learning.
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:38.340]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.300]   And the ability to pay attention to a teacher,
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.660]   which is not as stimulating as what you're seeing on TikTok.
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:44.500]   - Yeah, there's tons of learning,
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.820]   but it's learning of all the wrong things.
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:46.820]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:51.380]   So, that's the third norm, is phone-free schools.
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:53.180]   You have to lock up the phone in the morning,
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.580]   either in a phone lock or a yonder pouch.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.340]   If the policy is you keep it in your pocket,
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.180]   that's not a policy, that's just a recipe
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:00.580]   for constant conflict with the kids
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:02.020]   'cause they can't help it, they have to text.
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:04.860]   If anyone's texting, they have to be texting.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.180]   And the fourth norm is the hardest.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:09.220]   The fourth norm is far more independence,
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:11.540]   free play, and responsibility in the real world,
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:13.820]   because what we need to do is not just roll back
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.980]   the phone-based childhood and make them just sit
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:18.340]   and do nothing, what we have to do is restore
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:20.420]   a really fun, adventurous childhood.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.620]   Like what you were saying, you go out on your bicycle,
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:23.660]   you're hanging out with your friends,
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:27.380]   sometimes something happens, and boy, you have memories.
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.340]   Exciting things happen, scary things happen,
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.940]   you have memories.
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:34.660]   And I worry about what boys today,
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:36.940]   I have a group of buddies, my group of friends,
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.500]   we still talk about things that happened,
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:40.940]   things that are amazing, things that happened
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.980]   when we were in college or after college.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:46.100]   And I wonder what boys, young boys today are gonna say,
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.140]   you know, you remember Fortnite game 27,363
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.780]   where you were trapped in that elevator shaft
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.100]   and I had to shoot you out?
[01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:53.340]   No, I don't remember that one.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:56.300]   You know, like, the virtual adventures
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.260]   are just not gonna cut it, our kids need adventure,
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.380]   they need independence and adventure
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:02.460]   where they work out the conflicts themselves.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:04.260]   So if we do those four things,
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:07.800]   I think we can restore childhood in the real world.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.420]   No smartphone before high school,
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:12.300]   no social media 'til 16, phone-free schools,
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.180]   more independence, free play and responsibility
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:15.620]   in the real world, those four things.
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:17.620]   And these are things that we can all do
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.060]   if we work together, if we do them at the same time.
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.260]   If you're the only family that's keeping your kid
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:24.140]   off of a smartphone 'til high school
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:26.100]   and off of social media 'til 16,
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:27.460]   you're imposing a cost on your child
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:30.300]   and she may be lonely and she'll say, "Mom, I'm left out."
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.420]   Now she might still thank you, as we saw last night,
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:34.660]   some one of the women said her daughter thanked her
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:37.140]   for keeping her off, but at the time it was painful for her.
[01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:40.900]   And so my hope is by spreading these norms,
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:43.460]   no parent will ever be in that position again
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:45.660]   where their kid is the only one in the class
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.500]   who doesn't have a smartphone at age 10.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:52.980]   - To have this fantastic list, I say fantastic
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.420]   because it jives with all of the neurobiology
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:59.460]   that I'm aware of, and because it offers solutions.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:01.300]   It's really based on knowing what's happened
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:04.460]   and it's happening with smartphone use.
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:06.500]   There are a bunch of don'ts, but then there's some do's,
[01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:11.020]   which, again, I'm not an expert in behavioral change,
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:13.100]   but I spend a fair amount of my time talking to people
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.020]   about what they can do for their health and wellbeing
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:16.540]   and not just the don'ts.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.900]   And I think it's important, as I understand,
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.220]   to have replacement behaviors.
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:24.180]   And also I think people of all ages want to do something
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.940]   that feels good the first time and every time,
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:27.020]   and that's good for them.
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.860]   And then you create that reinforcement loop
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.500]   in a different direction.
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:32.580]   You're offering all of that in the book and here,
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:33.780]   and it's fabulous.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:38.700]   What I wonder about and would love to help
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:42.140]   in any way that I can with is,
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:45.020]   if you recall years ago, there was this understanding
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.020]   about the first six years of life being critical.
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:48.100]   It was the first six years.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:50.220]   And so parents kind of overstepped it a bit
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:51.900]   and were playing their kids Mozart all the time
[01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:53.100]   and things like that. - Waste of time.
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.020]   - But what was interesting is that they were thinking
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.980]   about critical periods and brain plasticity.
[01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:00.420]   And so as a neurobiologist who studied brain development,
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:01.620]   I was delighted.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:07.260]   It seems to me that if there was an understanding
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:10.980]   that the biology and psychology and sociology
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:13.900]   points to the fact that there is a critical period,
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.460]   maybe not even a sensitive period,
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:18.340]   but a critical period in which excessive smartphone use
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:22.880]   of a particular type is actually leading to more suicides,
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:26.220]   depression, anxiety, and less learning
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:29.660]   and adaptive behavior in life,
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.500]   it seems to me that it should be almost like a law.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.940]   It should be implemented at the level,
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.500]   certainly at the national level.
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:40.260]   What sorts of barriers do you think exist to that?
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.020]   Obviously I'm enthusiastic in joining your effort
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:47.260]   and I know many people listening will be as well
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:49.380]   to try and implement these four things.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:51.980]   But what do you think it would really take
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.500]   to get people to take their children's brains
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:58.180]   and lives seriously?
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:03.140]   Because children can't be left to their own self-care
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:03.980]   to that degree.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:05.180]   It's just unfair, right?
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:06.820]   I mean, it's like telling a kid in a candy shop,
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:09.820]   like, hey, listen, figure it out.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.660]   There's nutritious food down the street.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:12.820]   That's unfair, right?
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.500]   It's like a puppy trying to do the Westminster championship.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.140]   It's like, it's not gonna happen.
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:21.620]   But this is serious stuff.
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.540]   I mean, we're talking about the future
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:25.900]   not just of the United States, but of the entire species.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:28.700]   So what about laws?
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:29.600]   What about legislature?
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.440]   How does that work?
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.380]   I don't know anything about that.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.100]   - Sure, well, first, so let's note,
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.040]   I could be wrong about this.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.140]   It might be that the phones aren't doing this.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.260]   Now, I think the evidence is pretty good that it is,
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:43.300]   but let's suppose there's a 70% chance that I'm right.
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:46.420]   Let's suppose there was only a 30% chance I was right.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.580]   The consequences are so severe, we should be taking action.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.960]   Now, what action to take?
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.220]   I was over in the UK for the book about three weeks ago
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:56.980]   and in the UK and the rest of Europe,
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.300]   the first thought of everyone is ban it, ban it, ban it,
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:01.000]   government law, ban.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.740]   And there are times when we need that.
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:05.180]   Cigarette smoking under age, just ban it.
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.540]   Like you should not have kids smoking.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:08.220]   Now in Britain, there was a lot of consideration
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:12.300]   of should we ban the sale of smartphones to kids under 14?
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:17.060]   And I met with the policy unit at number 10 Downing Street
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:20.100]   and I said, now, wait a second, guys.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:23.100]   As an American, it never even occurred to me to suggest that
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:27.020]   you need to get norms first.
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:30.820]   If you pass laws that are out of phase with people's norms,
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:33.140]   they're gonna really hate you and they're gonna resent it.
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:35.660]   So let's start with a norm change first.
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:39.260]   And so I think that's really happening.
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.980]   So in Britain, parents are up in arms.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.780]   They really are changing rapidly over there.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.180]   They're a couple of months ahead of us.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:46.380]   In America, I think it's happening right now.
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:49.180]   And so if we just develop a consensus,
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:51.740]   we need to see smartphones in the hands of kids
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:53.500]   as being like cigarettes in the hands of kids.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.860]   Like, you know, you just don't do that.
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:55.940]   You don't do that.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.460]   Of course, they can be on a laptop.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.660]   They can be on a computer.
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.820]   They can do some things on your iPhone sometimes.
[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:04.620]   It's not poison, but you don't want it to be habit forming.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:08.960]   So I think that for keeping smartphones
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.380]   out of the hands of kids, there's no law.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:14.420]   I don't want a law banning that, but we just need a norm.
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:19.420]   Now for raising the age to 16, we can struggle to do that.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.620]   I'm doing that with my kids.
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:23.860]   I'm saying no for my daughter, no Snapchat till you're 16.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.620]   And she's the only one who doesn't have it.
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:27.900]   It's painful for her, and she's 14.
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:30.960]   But my hope is that no parent, again,
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.860]   will be in that situation that in every school,
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:36.560]   a lot of the parents are gonna say no social media till 16.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:39.260]   Now, of course, the laws currently state
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.600]   that you have to be 13 in order to sign a contract,
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.980]   give away your data, and make a deal with a company
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:46.480]   without your parents' knowledge or permission.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:49.260]   But Congress passed this terrible law in 1998
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.660]   the COPA, Child Online Privacy Protection Act.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:55.340]   It was supposed to set the age to 16,
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:57.100]   which is I think pretty reasonable,
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:00.860]   but it got pushed down to 13 with no enforcement.
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:02.620]   The law is written such that as long as the company
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.520]   doesn't absolutely know that you're under age,
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.780]   they're fine, they're not responsible.
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:08.120]   - 13. - They're motivated.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.100]   The companies are now, the law motivates the companies
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:12.100]   to not know how old children are.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:13.780]   - There's barely any forebrain at 13.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:14.860]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:16.100]   And since all you have to do,
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.740]   you just have to be old enough to lie about your age.
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:18.840]   If you're old enough to lie about your age,
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:20.260]   you can go anywhere on the internet
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:21.780]   because there's no enforcement.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:23.540]   So I'm saying let's take the age of 13,
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:24.980]   which is not enforced.
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.540]   Let's require age verification, which is complicated,
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:28.980]   but they're working on that in Britain.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:29.860]   They're mandating that.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:30.940]   It's gonna happen in Britain.
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:32.740]   We'll work out the technical details.
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:36.860]   So mandate age verification and raise the age to 16.
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:39.700]   That's the one place where I think we really do need law
[01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.100]   because social media is a social trap.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:44.580]   And if half the kids are on it,
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:45.460]   there's gonna be a lot of pressure
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:46.860]   on the other half to join.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.920]   So we need to get that down to like only,
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:52.040]   if 5% sneak around and they find a way on, that's fine.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.240]   So that's where we definitely need law.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.440]   And then the play stuff, there we could use some laws.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.880]   So I co-founded an organization called Let Grow.
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.200]   If you go to letgrow.org with Lenore Skenazy,
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.660]   we advocate for returning play to children.
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:07.700]   And one of the things we've done
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.000]   is we've gotten laws passed in eight states
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000]   that say that if you let your child out to play,
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.340]   that cannot be taken as evidence of child neglect.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:19.260]   Whereas at present, laws are ambiguous.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:22.380]   So if you send your eight-year-old out to a store,
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:24.220]   and this has happened to friends of mine,
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.340]   and some nosy neighbor says, where's your mother?
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:27.620]   Does she know you're out here?
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:30.920]   And then they call 911 and the police come
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.540]   because no one has seen an eight-year-old
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.140]   unaccompanied since the '90s.
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:36.500]   So the police come, and once the police come,
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:39.140]   they're very likely to refer it to Child Protective Services.
[01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:40.980]   And once your family is in the grip
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:43.220]   of Child Protective Services, you've got custody battles,
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:44.980]   you've got supervision, you're not allowed alone with children.
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:47.180]   I mean, it's crazy what happens.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.220]   So eight states have now said, no, no more of that.
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:50.900]   This is insane.
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:55.900]   So law could help to stop incentivizing helicopter parenting,
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:59.780]   to provide more spaces that are safe for kids to play in,
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:01.540]   not car zones.
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:03.780]   So the book has, "The Excess Generation,"
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.540]   the whole fourth part of it is suggestions for governments,
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:09.260]   for tech companies, for schools, and for parents.
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:11.700]   There's a lot we can do to restore
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:14.220]   a play-based childhood in the real world.
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.260]   - I realized that some of this is dependent
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.720]   on income for a household, et cetera,
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:23.940]   but is there any protective effect of, say, summer camp?
[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.060]   - Oh, yes.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:28.900]   - Or protective effect of even just after-school sport,
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:31.660]   where both the kids and the parents agree,
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:33.620]   no phones on the field.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:36.140]   You know, we're not taping for every goal.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:39.460]   I mean, I love seeing my friends' kids, you know,
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:41.700]   getting a three-pointer at a game or something like that.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.460]   You know, I delight in that on Instagram,
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:45.500]   and it's wild that my friends,
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:48.020]   given who I know them to be growing up,
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:50.440]   have these kids and the stories I could tell,
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.140]   but in all seriousness, it's wonderful.
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:55.820]   And yet I'm thinking they're taking a video
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:57.380]   of their kid playing the game.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:01.100]   You know, wouldn't it be wonderful
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:04.140]   if there were no phones at after-school sports events?
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.720]   So it's a couple of hours, three times a week,
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:11.820]   or once a week even, where at least these young brains
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:14.500]   are exposed to a different kind of reinforcement learning.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.320]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.060]   The British have a saying,
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.060]   "Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington,"
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:23.660]   which is a line from an old Noel Coward song.
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:26.540]   And it acknowledges that especially for girls,
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:28.900]   for girls to grow up being looked at, admired,
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.200]   and commented on about their looks,
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.160]   it's just really, really bad for them.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:34.460]   But to grow up always being photographed,
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:36.100]   everything you do and post it online,
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.920]   it's really bad for them.
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.460]   So yes, in response to your question,
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:41.320]   first, summer camps are magic.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:42.960]   Never send your child to a summer camp
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.260]   that doesn't ban phones,
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:47.400]   because this is the best chance you have for a detox.
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.500]   And I hear this story over and over again.
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:53.260]   You know, my girl got an iPhone when she was 11,
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:54.640]   she suddenly became Surly,
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.760]   no longer the sweet, funny child she was.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.920]   I sent her to summer camp the next summer,
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.440]   and lo and behold, the girl that comes back
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.160]   is my wonderful, sweet 11-year-old.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:03.880]   You know, her personality is back,
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.960]   and then she gets back on her phone
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.440]   and she becomes Surly again.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.520]   So summer camps are the most powerful technique
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.620]   known for a detox,
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:13.760]   because the kid isn't being deprived.
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:17.280]   They are in a bunk with other kids with no phones,
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:19.640]   and they're joking and talking and laughing and fighting
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.440]   and doing all those healthy things.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.760]   So summer camp is amazing.
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.040]   The other thing that the evidence shows
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.600]   is that team sports and religion,
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:28.400]   those two things are very, very protective.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.580]   So I would strongly urge people
[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:32.560]   to encourage their kids to play team sports.
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.360]   My kids run track, which is great,
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:37.020]   but team sports force more cooperation.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.520]   So there's some evidence that team sports
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.640]   are even better for their mental health
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:42.440]   than individual sports.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.160]   You don't want super-duper, oversupervised,
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:47.560]   high-pressure sports leagues.
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.860]   I mean, that's better than nothing.
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:50.640]   But ideally, the more they play games
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.960]   that are more intramural, informal,
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:54.840]   the kids are enforcing the rules,
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.360]   all of that would be better.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.120]   Our kids are not rooted in communities anymore,
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:02.360]   but sports and religion are two things that do that.
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.240]   - What about music?
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.920]   I did an episode on music and the brain,
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:09.480]   and one of the more thrilling and interesting parts to me
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:12.280]   was, and I have no musical talent whatsoever,
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.080]   singing or instrumental or otherwise.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.800]   I love listening to music, however,
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.120]   was that kids that grow up playing an instrument,
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.040]   especially cooperatively with other people in a band,
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:24.660]   you know, a duet or a quartet or a band,
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:27.760]   or orchestra or a marching band,
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.360]   there's some very impressive data
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.160]   in terms of potential for additional neuroplasticity.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.260]   In fact, the brain-wide networks,
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:39.120]   the sort of patterns of connectivity are much more broad
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.440]   in kids that learned an instrument
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.320]   and played it cooperatively than those
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:45.360]   that try and learn an instrument later in life,
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.720]   although there's still advantages to that.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:50.600]   So I wonder if that could be added to the list.
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:53.300]   - Yes, playing in a band or singing in a choir,
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:55.000]   I think definitely should be.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.200]   For a while, I was really interested in synchrony,
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.800]   and synchrony has all these really powerful effects.
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.480]   There's a wonderful book called
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.820]   "Keeping Together in Time" by William McNeil.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:07.200]   He was, either he signed up
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.160]   or he was drafted into World War II,
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:11.060]   training at a camp in Texas.
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.840]   They're marching up and down with wooden guns
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:14.320]   'cause they don't have real guns.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.660]   And at first it seemed stupid to him,
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:18.040]   but after a few days, his unit gets it.
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:21.400]   And when they can, they're like a unit,
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:24.520]   they're like a centipede, they're imperfect, you know,
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:27.880]   and it was like a loss of self, it was ecstatic.
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:29.280]   And so he goes off to World War II,
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:31.880]   he writes, comes back and writes about, you know,
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:34.000]   men in battle, he writes, oh, that's a different book,
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:34.840]   a different book title.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:39.800]   But those sorts of being in sync, those experiences,
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:43.000]   we are an ultra social species,
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.300]   we're much more social than dogs or chimpanzees.
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:48.040]   We have this ability to keep together in time
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.440]   and do things synchronously.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.400]   And all around the world, that's what rituals used to do.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.540]   It's thrilling.
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:58.200]   And so the self-transcending experiences that you get
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.660]   from singing in a choir, from playing in a band,
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:02.400]   I don't have much talent either,
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.440]   but I did play in a informal rock band when I was at UVA,
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.040]   we called ourselves Pavlov's Dogs,
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.300]   we were all in the psych department.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:12.540]   But the first time we got it and we were all really in sync,
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:15.240]   it was totally thrilling.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.580]   So yeah, the more you give your kids,
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:19.720]   I have a whole section actually in chapter two of the book
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:22.640]   on synchrony and attunement.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:25.040]   We, you know, we need to be in sync
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:27.780]   and that's why face-to-face interaction is so important.
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:30.400]   Whereas when you're communicating on Instagram
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.380]   or any social media, it's asynchronous.
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:35.700]   You don't have the automatic attunement.
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:39.280]   - Can I get a little new agey speculative?
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:40.120]   - All right, let's go.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:41.080]   - I have a question.
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:46.080]   So I've heard you and others say that, you know,
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:49.600]   kids and probably adults nowadays are not familiar
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.120]   with what it is to be bored.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.440]   There's always an input.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:57.680]   Movie on social media, YouTube,
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.060]   there's always words streaming at us in audio or written.
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.260]   There's this concept that I love
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:04.920]   from the world of mindfulness,
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:06.220]   which used to be considered new agey,
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:08.340]   but now I think every academic campus
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:11.500]   has at least a few grants focused on meditation
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:14.020]   and its benefits and respiration, breath work
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:14.860]   and its benefits.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:16.300]   So we've come a long way.
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:19.280]   But there's this concept of wordlessness,
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.620]   of the importance of being in states of wordlessness
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.740]   where we're not reading,
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:24.540]   we're not thinking in complete sentences,
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:28.060]   we're not taking in sensory information.
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:30.760]   And we, under those conditions,
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.380]   are able to actually register how we feel about things.
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:38.080]   So we become better tuned to sense our environment
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.860]   and input when it comes.
[01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:42.840]   And I wonder, because my experience of social media
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:47.840]   has been whether or not kids are on Instagram,
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.660]   Snapchat, et cetera, and they're doing it
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:52.760]   out of whatever compulsion, habit, addiction,
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.180]   whatever you want to call it.
[01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:56.820]   But I'm not sure it feels good to them.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:58.700]   I'm not sure it does.
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:01.500]   I'm not sure it's like the ice cream that tastes delicious.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.200]   I think it might start that way.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.140]   And occasionally, you know, they're jackpots, right?
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:10.180]   But that in large part, adults,
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:11.280]   but since we're talking about kids,
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:13.740]   let's talk about kids in this very critical,
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:18.740]   sensitive period of life, are not feeling good.
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:20.860]   And they might not even know they're not feeling good.
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:22.340]   They're just compulsively,
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:24.120]   and there I'm using the term loosely,
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:26.300]   not clinically, compulsively engaging.
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:28.680]   And so I wonder whether or not there's some benefit
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:33.440]   to kids not just being bored for experiencing boredom sake,
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.060]   but learning to actually be a better sensor
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:39.100]   of what they like and don't like.
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:40.820]   Because when I talk to my niece
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:44.260]   or I talk to other young people now,
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:47.700]   they seem to be like becoming increasingly aware
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:50.460]   of how much some of the online stuff sucks.
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:51.300]   That's the language.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:52.260]   They're not like, oh, it's awesome.
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:53.420]   Don't take it away from me.
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:54.720]   They're like, I don't want to miss out,
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:56.660]   but it's also painful to them.
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:58.080]   It's, I mean, it's like they're drinking
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:00.140]   from a fire hose of nails.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:01.580]   And then every once in a while,
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:02.840]   there's something that tastes good.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.140]   It's not like they're like,
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:05.380]   this is so cool and that's so cool.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:07.140]   But of course, if you give them a really cool video
[01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:09.860]   of a animal thing or a social dynamics thing
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:12.780]   or a war game or whatever, they'll get excited.
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:14.060]   But I don't get the impression
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.260]   that they're like, this is awesome.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:19.740]   It's more like, this has me by the short hairs.
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:22.300]   It's got me scruffed and I'm just doing it.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.300]   And I don't know how to stop it.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.420]   And that's certainly the way, sorry.
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:29.660]   Certainly the way that boys reach out,
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:31.420]   guys, young guys typically reach out
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.060]   about their porn addictions.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:35.940]   I hear about this thousands of messages.
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:37.100]   Help me get over this.
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:39.180]   So I refer them to our episode on addiction
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:40.740]   by Dr. Anna Lembke from Stanford.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:41.580]   - Oh, I love her.
[01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:42.400]   - Yeah, she's amazing.
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:43.240]   - Oh yeah, listen to that episode.
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:44.940]   - Yeah, she's spectacular.
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:48.700]   Or it's just that they're desperate.
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:49.540]   They're desperate.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:50.820]   So I don't see it as all pleasure.
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:52.220]   I see it as mostly pain.
[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:53.060]   - That's right.
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:54.980]   So there's a lot going on here.
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:58.120]   For some of them, they are addicted
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.460]   and they feel bad for the reasons
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:03.000]   you were talking about, dopamine overshoot.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.700]   They feel bad when they're not doing the addictive activities
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:08.060]   so they are compulsively using it.
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:09.140]   Just like a gambler.
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:11.860]   If you're addicted to slot machines, your life sucks.
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:13.140]   You've spent all your family's money.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:14.580]   You're ashamed of what happened.
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:15.900]   You feel terrible.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.420]   Oh, but if I just get back into the zone
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:20.700]   on the slot machine, I feel good for that two or three hours.
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:21.940]   - That's the most dangerous addiction
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:23.300]   'cause as it's been described to me,
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:26.860]   I'm fortunately not a gambling addict, excuse me.
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:30.820]   The gambler really does believe
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.780]   that the next one could change everything.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:34.820]   - Right, it's gonna cause motivated reasoning.
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:37.500]   It's gonna cause hopefulness that is dashed.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.940]   So for some of them, it is a kind of self-medication.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:43.580]   As soon as the boys move their social lives
[01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:45.660]   onto video games and porn
[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:47.980]   and the girls move their social lives onto social media,
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:50.000]   both sexes got really lonely.
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:53.740]   They're getting lots of cheap and easy stimulation,
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.500]   but it's not satisfying.
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:57.780]   So what do they do now that they're lonely and anxious?
[01:58:57.780 --> 01:59:00.340]   Well, sometimes they do more of it.
[01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:03.040]   So some of it is driven by that feedback cycle,
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.540]   that they're now uncomfortable, so they need more of it.
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:09.220]   But the other part is the compulsion to consume
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.820]   because everyone else says they have to keep up.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.380]   And so my students at NYU, I asked them,
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:16.940]   okay, some of you are spending four, five, six hours a day
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:19.220]   on social media, why don't you quit?
[01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:21.900]   Oh, I can't because I have to know
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.220]   what everyone's talking about.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:24.380]   I have to see the latest video.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:26.380]   I have to keep up with it.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:30.300]   And since I can't deal with my email and my text,
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:31.180]   like those two combined,
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:32.740]   that's more than I can handle in a day.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.180]   I can't stand it.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.780]   I can't imagine having five platforms in addition.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:38.260]   And most, I don't know the exact number,
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:40.140]   but very few of my students are on a single platform.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:42.740]   Most of them are on two or three regularly,
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:46.400]   plus email and texting and Snapchat.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.100]   So it is kind of like, imagine food is great,
[01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:51.820]   but imagine always having to eat.
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:53.260]   You have to always be eating.
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:55.500]   Like our system can't handle that.
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:58.140]   Imagine a plant always in a shower,
[01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:02.640]   like it's always, like no, you need times of taking in
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:04.760]   and times of digesting or processing.
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:06.900]   One of the most valuable,
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:09.220]   I'll tell you two of the most valuable exercises
[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:11.340]   that we do in my flourishing class at NYU.
[02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:14.420]   The first is a prerequisite to everything else
[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:16.800]   is they have to regain control of their attention.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.040]   And once they understand that they've given away
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:20.880]   almost all of their attention,
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:24.440]   any moment that isn't taken up by a teacher or something,
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.540]   it's the phone for a lot of them,
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:28.640]   because there's so much to process.
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:31.320]   They have so many direct messages, so many group texts.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.500]   They have to always be processing,
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.560]   or they feel like they're being left behind,
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:36.840]   they're not participating.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:37.980]   So I make them see,
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:39.440]   you've got to regain control of your attention.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.800]   You've got to shut off almost all notifications.
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:44.520]   You leave on Uber 'cause you want Uber to interrupt you
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:47.720]   to say the car is three minutes away, that's good.
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.280]   But how many of the companies,
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:51.760]   is it that important that they interrupt you?
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:52.600]   Very, very few.
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.280]   So shut off almost all your notifications,
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.680]   get social media off your phone.
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:58.120]   If you need to use it, you can use it on your computer,
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:59.680]   but don't always have it set in every,
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:02.120]   like at NYU, in any elevator,
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:03.920]   as soon as students get on the elevator,
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:06.040]   the phone comes up because that's like 30 seconds
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:06.880]   and it's awkward.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.480]   Take the phone out, scroll.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.160]   - I would argue the professors too.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.000]   - Yeah, that's true.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.320]   - I'm not you, I'm not gonna spend time
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:14.880]   with you in an elevator yet, but.
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.720]   - No, we do, we do, but it's less.
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:17.560]   - Is that right?
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:20.840]   And then the other one that I did,
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:23.320]   that is really memorable,
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.200]   and I talk about this in the book, is an awe walk.
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:29.040]   And I got this idea, my friend, Dacher Keltner,
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:30.720]   he and I did research on awe long ago
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:31.800]   and he really continued it.
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:34.560]   He wrote this amazing book called "Awe".
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.520]   And there was a great episode,
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:40.000]   if you just Google Keltner and Tippett,
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.120]   so with Chris to Tippett, he did this great discussion.
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:44.840]   He talks about how he used awe walks
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:48.640]   to help him process his brother's early death from cancer.
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:51.600]   And just walking in a beautiful environment,
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.640]   walk a little more slowly than usual.
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:55.860]   Don't have anything in your ears.
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:57.200]   Don't be listening to music.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.520]   Don't even bring your phone and just notice.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:01.800]   And it's magical.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.740]   It's amazing what happens when you do that.
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:07.040]   And for a lot of my students, they've never done that
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.220]   'cause they have to take in so much stuff.
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:10.660]   If I'm going from point A to point B,
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:12.760]   of course I'm gonna be listening to a podcast
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:16.160]   or scrolling on my phone while I'm walking.
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:17.360]   And a lot of them,
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.720]   they really had these transformative experiences.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:21.440]   We're right on Washington Square Park at NYU.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.320]   We're built around Washington Square Park,
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:24.880]   which is a gorgeous, gorgeous park.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:26.280]   It's really one of the most beautiful in America,
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:28.920]   certainly one of the most beautiful urban parks, I'd say.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:32.280]   And the students who did their awe walk through the park,
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:34.480]   a lot of them had these just amazing experiences.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.120]   It's almost like their heart is opening.
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:39.220]   They feel more love for people.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:41.560]   Their anxiety goes down.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:44.500]   And so ever since they, so I did that myself.
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:45.860]   When I signed it, I did it too.
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.740]   And I had that sort of experience.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:50.180]   So now, I love my AirPods.
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:51.460]   They're amazingly convenient.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:52.860]   But I listen to them a lot less now.
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.420]   Like when I'm walking in New York City,
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:56.340]   I often just, just nothing, just nothing.
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:58.540]   Just look, process, think.
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.500]   So yes, I think young people are taking in
[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:02.060]   way too much stuff.
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:05.540]   Total quantity of bytes is just 10 times what it should be.
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:06.880]   And they don't have time to process.
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.780]   They don't have time to develop an interior life,
[02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:11.540]   to think things through.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:13.760]   So we just gotta cut it way back.
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:18.020]   - If I step back from everything that you've said thus far
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:23.020]   and is in your book, it seems as if until 2012 or so,
[02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:27.740]   what was rewarded in youth set us up
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:30.260]   for a more adaptive adulthood.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:33.260]   But now, everything that's being rewarded in youth,
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:36.860]   except from schools and teachers and parents,
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:39.860]   but what's being rewarded on a moment-to-moment basis
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:44.860]   for the majority of the waking life of these young people
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:46.140]   is maladaptive.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:47.100]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.980]   - I mean, it's so stark.
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:49.820]   - That's right.
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:51.640]   Think about it this way.
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.900]   Imagine that your children are having a life
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:54.740]   out in the real world.
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:55.560]   They're having adventures.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:56.400]   They're doing things.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.580]   They're building forts in the forest.
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:03:58.980]   They're doing all sorts of things.
[02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:03.220]   And then one day, a casino opens up nearby
[02:04:03.220 --> 02:04:04.460]   and it welcomes all the kids.
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.580]   And that's where they spend all their time is in a casino.
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:08.140]   And they're in the care of a company
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.860]   that is trying to extract as much money as it can from them.
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:12.980]   And that's what they do eight or 10 hours a day.
[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:14.780]   It's an abomination to think that a casino
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.980]   could own our children's childhood.
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:17.820]   What if it wasn't a casino?
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:19.860]   What if it was a brothel for the boys?
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:21.060]   Would be more of interest, let's say.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:24.140]   Like, again, inconceivable that we would let that happen.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:26.140]   But what we've done is we've said,
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:27.260]   well, what if it's Snapchat?
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:28.340]   What if it's Instagram?
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:29.220]   What if it's Facebook?
[02:04:29.220 --> 02:04:30.460]   Well, not so much Facebook.
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:31.980]   What if it's TikTok?
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:34.380]   These companies, these are some of the largest
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:36.340]   and most powerful companies in the world.
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:38.180]   They essentially own our children's childhood.
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.660]   This is where childhood is taking place
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:42.460]   on a few giant for-profit platforms
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:44.420]   that use an advertising-based business model.
[02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:47.700]   So they are motivated, like the casino, to keep them in.
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:48.740]   Don't have a clock.
[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:50.180]   Don't let them see what time it is.
[02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:51.580]   Keep them in.
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:53.700]   Don't let them click over to a link to another site.
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:54.580]   Keep them in.
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:58.220]   We somehow have ceded our children's childhood
[02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:00.780]   to giant companies that have shown
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:02.940]   that they don't really care about our kids' welfare.
[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:05.220]   They care much more about profitability
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.860]   and they care about their customers,
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:08.540]   who are the advertisers.
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:10.900]   And these companies have been granted
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:13.300]   a special writ from the king.
[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:16.500]   Congress said in Section 230,
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:19.740]   the Communications Decency Act in 1996, I think it was,
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:22.420]   Congress said, oh, and nobody can sue you.
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:25.180]   Nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids.
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:26.300]   There was a reason for that,
[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:28.220]   that you don't want AOL to be responsible
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:29.980]   for everything anyone posts.
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:31.620]   But it's been so broadly interpreted
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.900]   that so far, any attempt to regulate social media
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:36.660]   or any attempt to sue them is seen as like, nope, nothing.
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:40.100]   So, you know, it's just, we somehow slipped into this.
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:41.860]   And once you see it that way,
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.740]   that it's as though our kids are being raised
[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:46.180]   in Harrah's Casino, you know,
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:48.460]   like, no, we've got to stop this.
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:51.500]   - Last year, I had the opportunity to speak
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:53.660]   to some of the groups at these companies
[02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:57.620]   that are assigned to controlling the wellbeing
[02:05:57.620 --> 02:06:00.980]   of the young people that use their platforms.
[02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:04.260]   And the major emphasis was on the type of content.
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:06.700]   So protecting them against child predators,
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:09.180]   protecting them against pornography.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.820]   But as you recall, at the beginning of the conversation,
[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:12.780]   we broke things down into variables of time,
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:14.340]   specific content dynamics,
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.780]   and maybe the visual interface itself.
[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:18.340]   I think for sake of today's discussion,
[02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:20.420]   the visual interface is probably the least interesting,
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:22.900]   but I can just tell you looking at things up close,
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:24.820]   a lot not good, the eyeball lengthens,
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:26.340]   you become nearsighted,
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:29.500]   which is why spending two hours outside,
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:32.060]   even if on a tablet, has been shown to offset myopia
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:35.100]   and thousands of people, children.
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:36.580]   Anyway, there's that piece.
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:39.700]   But the time piece is interesting, right?
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:42.660]   Maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media.
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:44.540]   Obviously the content issue is,
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:47.020]   it only takes one exposure to a video
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:49.020]   of the sort that you described, the gauntlet.
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:50.500]   I never want to see it.
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:51.700]   Whatever has to be done to my phone
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:54.440]   so that I never see it, please let me know.
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:07:00.700]   But it just seems as if this has been allowed to,
[02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:03.460]   it's almost like an IV drip of glucose
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:04.940]   or something happening in the background.
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:07.180]   We're saying, okay, just stay rigged up
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:09.380]   to the glucose drip.
[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:11.340]   And then we wonder why we're end up with,
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:14.220]   let's just say cognitively obese children.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:15.740]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:17.320]   Whenever there's new media,
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:21.460]   the public's emphasis is always on the content.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:23.940]   And so with television, the emphasis was,
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:27.220]   well, violence on TV, is this gonna make them violent?
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:28.780]   And it turns out, not really.
[02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:31.380]   Watching violence on TV doesn't really make you violent.
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:33.180]   And video games, these violent video games,
[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:34.260]   these first-person shooter games,
[02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:36.220]   are these gonna make our kids into killers?
[02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.300]   And there was a lot of research on that.
[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:39.860]   It looks like, no, it doesn't really do that.
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:41.460]   And so many researchers then say,
[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:44.500]   see, it's just a moral panic, it's okay.
[02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:46.940]   But that's focusing on the content.
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:49.060]   And this was the great lesson from Marshall McLuhan
[02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.060]   and Neil Postman and all these great media theorists
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.940]   in the 20th century.
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:55.420]   McLuhan said the medium is the message.
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:57.980]   Don't focus so much on the content of television.
[02:07:57.980 --> 02:08:00.700]   Focus on the transformation of human life.
[02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:03.100]   When the television becomes the family hearth
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:05.060]   and people sit around watching it.
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:07.020]   Now, from our vantage point today,
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:08.260]   that's pretty darn social.
[02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:11.260]   They're sitting with their family members together,
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:12.620]   having an experience.
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:16.220]   But McLuhan's point was, that's the transformative thing,
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:17.460]   what the technology does.
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:18.620]   It's not the content.
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:21.740]   And so in the same way, life on social media,
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:23.940]   in some ways it's like television, you're watching stuff,
[02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:25.460]   but it's much more behaviorist.
[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:27.560]   With television, you didn't have the constant,
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:28.860]   I do something, I'm rewarded.
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:30.300]   I do something, I'm rewarded.
[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.500]   So social media is much, much more addictive
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.180]   than television ever was.
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:36.140]   That's one aspect of it.
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:37.660]   Television is not performative.
[02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:41.380]   It doesn't make you live your life in front of a camera.
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.220]   You're not in front of a camera.
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:43.540]   You're a passive recipient.
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:46.600]   Whereas social media puts our kids in front of a camera.
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:50.800]   So in all these ways, we get distracted.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:53.580]   And this is the way, in those Senate hearings,
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:55.760]   it was all focused on content.
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:59.620]   Can't we reduce the number of beheading videos
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:01.300]   and the child pornography?
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:03.220]   Suppose we, can't we reduce that by 90%?
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:04.420]   Wouldn't that be great?
[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:08.140]   Senator, we have the world-leading technology in doing this.
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:10.860]   Yes, that would be nice for our kids to see
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:13.780]   less hardcore porn and less violent videos.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:14.700]   That'd be nice.
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:16.260]   But if we could make Instagram
[02:09:16.260 --> 02:09:19.660]   just be happy girls living beautiful lives,
[02:09:19.660 --> 02:09:22.080]   and our daughters were to watch eight hours a day of this,
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:23.680]   is that good for them?
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.300]   Hell no.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.940]   So it is important to clean up the content,
[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:29.700]   but for kids going through puberty,
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:31.820]   I think the only real answer is just delay.
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:33.220]   Just don't let them do that.
[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:35.720]   - How much of the issue here is modeling
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.720]   of what adults are doing and how terrible are,
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:45.440]   or good are adults at modulating their behavior?
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:48.040]   - I say modulating because, you know,
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:51.720]   I see a lot of parents videotaping everything
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:54.600]   that they're, you know, on the phone all the time,
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.760]   in line at the store while their kids are around, you know?
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.080]   And one of the reasons I think parents like devices so much
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:04.240]   is that it's a terrific low cost, zero cost babysitter.
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:06.260]   It allows them to then go be on their phones
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:07.400]   or do other things.
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:08.240]   - Yeah.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:11.640]   So young children are sometimes copying their parents.
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:14.360]   Young children are looking for things to copy.
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:16.160]   And, you know, and so, I mean,
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:18.700]   I've got some slides in my regular book lecture
[02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:22.040]   of toy iPhones that we give to toddlers
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:24.840]   so that they can be just like mommy and daddy.
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:27.080]   For little kids, I think it might matter.
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:29.640]   For teenagers, you know, I'm very often asked that question
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:31.480]   because, and I think it's because parents,
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:32.320]   they feel a little guilty.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.040]   Like they know that they're modeling bad behavior
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:34.860]   and they're worried, like,
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:37.200]   is this setting up my kid for doing that?
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:38.040]   But I can't say for sure,
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:39.780]   but my intuition as a social psychologist
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:41.340]   is not really, not very much.
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:43.560]   And the reason is because, you know,
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:44.860]   while your kids once looked up to you
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:45.920]   and they once copied you,
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:48.560]   like by the time they're 12, 13, 14, you know,
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:50.600]   if I pick up, if I start reading, you know,
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:51.980]   The Economist magazine,
[02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:54.340]   or if I start knitting or whatever,
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:55.960]   that's not gonna make my 14 year old daughter
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:58.440]   wanna do those things because I'm doing them.
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.820]   She is completely focused
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:02.920]   on what her peer group thinks of her.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:03.760]   Of course she is.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.680]   That's the nature of teenage where they're moving away
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:07.700]   from the family and they're trying to make their way
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:08.800]   on their own in a peer group.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.560]   Lisa DeMora is great on these issues.
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.520]   So I don't, you know,
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:16.320]   it would be nice if parents could improve
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:19.520]   their phone habits and boy, phones at the table,
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:20.620]   that's an important place.
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:22.160]   That is a very, very important place.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:25.040]   Get across the idea that when we're eating,
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.920]   we're with each other, we're looking at each other
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:29.920]   and we're tasting our food, we're experiencing the food.
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:33.760]   So actually they're modeling collective behaviors
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:34.960]   like a meal.
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:37.080]   I think that is actually very, very valuable.
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.320]   But if it's just that, you know,
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.680]   you're often multitasking, you're often on your phone.
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:42.200]   Yeah, you know, be nice if you didn't,
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:43.920]   but that's not gonna push your kid
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.520]   over into phone addiction.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:48.760]   - So the list of four things that you provided are terrific.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.240]   They are somewhat enforcement focused.
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:55.040]   As I recall, and maybe this is not true,
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:58.320]   but as I recall, one of the ways that media
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:04.600]   was effective in getting kids to stop smoking
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:09.440]   was to pit them against these wealthy old white men
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:11.520]   who were in rooms filled with smoke,
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:12.840]   writhing their hands together,
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:14.860]   cackling about the amount of money they were making,
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:17.980]   stealing the health of young people.
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:20.720]   Whereas telling teenagers that smoking was bad for them
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:21.940]   did very little.
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:25.060]   So is there a way to create a rebellion of sorts
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:26.720]   against the smartphone?
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:31.160]   Because kids love to rebel, teens love to rebel.
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:32.920]   - First of all, they don't anymore.
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:35.200]   - Oh no, really?
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.360]   - Well, they're just much more passive.
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:40.320]   I don't think they're authority focused.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.800]   They're not as rebellious as they used to be.
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.120]   - That's disappointing.
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:45.460]   - Now, of course, now we'd have to pit them
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:47.200]   against a group of young white men
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:50.440]   who are owning the social media companies, I suppose.
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.400]   But this addiction is very different
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:54.720]   from tobacco or anything else.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:56.540]   Tobacco is biologically addictive.
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:13:00.440]   And you can't get an entire high school
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.340]   addicted biologically, at least it didn't happen.
[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:06.720]   In the peak year of smoking, it was 1997,
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.440]   37% of American high school students smoked.
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:11.180]   Two thirds didn't.
[02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:13.520]   But with social media, you couldn't have that.
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:14.960]   You couldn't have just a third.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:18.080]   It's either none or everybody, and it's everybody.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:19.640]   And it happens in middle school.
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:23.000]   So the dynamics of a social media addiction,
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.600]   it's a social addiction more than a biochemical
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:28.940]   like nicotine or cocaine type addiction.
[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:32.080]   So I think the way to break out isn't,
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.800]   hey, these people are exploiting you.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.200]   That might be helpful, we should definitely study that.
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:38.600]   I think the way to break out is, okay, look,
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:41.320]   you guys actually, you can see what this is doing to you.
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:43.900]   You mostly agree that this is wasting your time.
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:45.160]   It's garbage.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:48.120]   You want a way out, but you just feel like you can't.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:49.560]   There's such resignation.
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:52.680]   But look, the cool kids over there,
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:55.040]   they have flip phones and they're out
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:56.640]   like every day after school.
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.760]   They're like, you know, they're doing stuff.
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.440]   They're down at, you know, they're in the mall,
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:02.920]   they're getting pizza, they're, you know,
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:06.020]   building a fort, you know, whatever, depending on the age.
[02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:10.200]   So I think the way out is to give kids an exciting childhood.
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.800]   Kids are so lonely now
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:14.280]   and they don't have much in the way of adventure.
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:16.760]   They don't have much in the way of thrills.
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:19.640]   You know, I live in New York City.
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:22.320]   You know, I would like bring my kids out to Coney Island
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.320]   when they were, you know, nine, 10 years old,
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.280]   bring them out and then I would just say,
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:26.120]   I'm just gonna sit here.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:27.820]   You guys run around, you guys go have fun.
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:29.320]   Like, I'm not gonna be with you.
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:31.520]   You know, yeah, there's a chance you'll get kidnapped
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:35.020]   or struck by lightning, although lightning is more likely.
[02:14:35.020 --> 02:14:36.480]   So, and then it, you know, and then it got,
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.880]   once they were in, you know, in more, you know,
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:39.800]   like around like 13,
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:41.160]   now they can actually take the subway out
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:42.640]   to Coney Island with a friend.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:45.220]   So that's cool.
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:46.740]   I think that's the way to do it.
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:47.760]   Don't make it like,
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.560]   we're gonna take away all this stuff from you.
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:52.080]   Ha ha ha, now you have nothing to do.
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.120]   Make it more like, I'm not trying to hurt you here.
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:57.400]   I want you to have fun the way I did
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:58.860]   and the way your grandparents did.
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:01.520]   We all had human childhoods full of adventure.
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.040]   I want that for you.
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:05.880]   And I think most Gen Z will embrace that.
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:07.780]   They just don't wanna do it alone.
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:10.920]   So the key is, if you're listening to this podcast,
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.800]   and if you have kids that are in elementary
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:15.560]   and middle school, be sure to talk with the parents
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:17.000]   of your kids' friends.
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.960]   So if you wanna make some changes in your phone policies,
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:22.120]   if four families do it together,
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:24.360]   now your kid's not gonna feel left out or deprived.
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:26.800]   And be sure to give them something.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:28.400]   Give them, say, here, you know what?
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:29.920]   Every, how about every Friday,
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:32.040]   let's call it Free Play Friday.
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:34.600]   No piano lessons on Friday, no nothing on Friday.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:35.880]   Fridays, you all get together.
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:38.480]   You can start at anyone's house, go out, do what you want.
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:40.480]   We'll even, you know, we'll give you more allowance
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:43.980]   or we'll give you money to spend, but go have experiences.
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:46.700]   Then it's fun, it's not deprivation.
[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:51.200]   - I love the trust in kids to sort things out
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:52.760]   and to be safe enough.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:56.220]   At least the statistics say that they're more likely
[02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:58.640]   to thrive under those conditions than to be kidnapped
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.200]   or have something terrible happen.
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:03.440]   I like it also because it merges your previous book,
[02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:07.040]   "Coddling of the American Mind" with the current book,
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:08.560]   "The Anxious Generation."
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:12.180]   I have a bunch of other questions,
[02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:14.440]   but I think the most important one at this stage
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:18.460]   is how optimistic or pessimistic are you
[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:21.720]   about the changes that you're hoping for?
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:24.160]   And then the second question is how can we all help?
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.200]   I mean, you mentioned these four action items,
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:27.960]   no smartphone before high school,
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:30.880]   no social media until 16, phone-free schools,
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:33.800]   and to foster this exploration and independence.
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.920]   And we will propagate those four things
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:38.580]   as far and wide as we can.
[02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:42.440]   But I think everybody, parents and kids, I'm sure as well,
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:44.840]   want to know, like, what can we do?
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:49.160]   So optimism scale, zero being like you're doing this
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.460]   as a last ditch effort, but it's hopeless.
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:52.920]   Well, you wouldn't be here if you thought it was hopeless.
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:55.520]   So one to 10, one being just a sliver of hope,
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:57.360]   10 being, you know, we got this,
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.760]   same way we got other stuff in the past.
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:00.600]   - Yeah, I'm a 10.
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:02.360]   - You're a 10, awesome. - 10, 10.0, yeah.
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.840]   Yeah, and the reason is because
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:06.520]   I've never seen a situation like this.
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.080]   I've been involved in a lot of efforts to change attitudes.
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:13.040]   I ran a gun control group in college when I was 20,
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:14.400]   and that was impossible.
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:16.640]   And I've been involved in non-political campaigns.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:18.360]   You're trying to persuade people,
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:20.000]   and you can't get their attention,
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.680]   and how do you message them?
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.080]   And it's really hard.
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:24.920]   That's the way anybody involved in social change
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:27.000]   has experienced that, that's most things.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.920]   This is like, you drop a spark and everything goes,
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:31.720]   everything, it just goes everywhere.
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:35.560]   So all over the world, all over the developed world,
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:38.560]   family life has become a fight over screen time.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.040]   Almost every parent of a kid over two recognizes this.
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:43.720]   We all hate it, we're sick of it,
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.320]   and we've just been confused.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:47.320]   The only real pushback I've gotten, I've gotten two guys.
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:49.240]   One is I am in a normal academic debate
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:51.080]   with about seven or eight researchers
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.840]   who say there's not evidence of causality.
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.640]   I believe there is, we're marshalling evidence
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:57.720]   against each other.
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:01.840]   But by and large, almost everyone seems persuaded
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.160]   because they already knew this,
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:04.880]   they already thought it, they already saw it.
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:06.120]   And what I've done with the book
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:08.880]   is just given them some psychological concepts
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:11.920]   and some clear labels and a way out.
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:14.040]   And I'm so confident in part
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:17.440]   because the revolution started in Britain in February.
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.040]   Yes, they drew on some of my older articles,
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:21.680]   but this was before my book came out.
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:23.360]   Parents are self-organizing.
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:24.800]   In Britain, the government is acting.
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:27.080]   They actually have a functioning legislature in Britain
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:31.600]   and the government has led efforts to pass laws as well.
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:33.800]   So I know it's working in Britain.
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:38.040]   And I see it happening here now at a massive scale.
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:40.560]   The point of the book is collective action.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.880]   And parents all over the country are heeding that.
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:44.280]   They're forming reading groups.
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:46.880]   They're going in in a group to talk with the principal.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:49.360]   The principals and teachers, they all hate the phones.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:50.640]   It makes their lives impossible.
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:52.440]   They want a phone-free school,
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:54.160]   but they were afraid of the few parents
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:58.000]   who freak out if they can't text their child during class.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.960]   If the schools are overwhelmed by parents saying,
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:01.600]   "Please lock up the phones.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.840]   "Please let my child have six hours a day
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:05.200]   "when she can listen to the teacher
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:06.760]   "instead of do more TikTok."
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:10.920]   So I'm very, very confident
[02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:13.040]   that childhood is going to look very different
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:14.680]   within two years.
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:17.520]   I don't mean that it won't be seven-year-olds on phones,
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:20.880]   but in the same way that we flipped on smoking,
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:23.360]   we used to think it was okay to smoke in an airplane.
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:25.000]   We used to think it was okay to smoke in restaurants.
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.400]   It was okay to smoke everywhere, we thought.
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:28.240]   And now we don't.
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:29.200]   We don't think that anymore.
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:32.160]   That took a long time to change, but it did change.
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:34.960]   I think because of the public disgust
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:38.280]   with seeing children just spending their childhood
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:39.360]   looking at a screen,
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:41.640]   and because the public disgust with what we've heard
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:45.320]   about Meta and TikTok and a few of the other companies,
[02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:47.760]   I think within two years, it's going to be widespread.
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:50.800]   It'll be a norm that you just don't give kids
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:52.120]   social media in particular.
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:53.560]   I mean, iPads are complicated
[02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:56.240]   'cause you want kids to watch movies is okay.
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.080]   Stories are good.
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:59.280]   I'm not saying the iPad is a terrible thing,
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:02.760]   but our attitudes about this are going to change radically.
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:05.320]   And I think the great majority of schools
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:07.520]   are going to be phone-free within two years.
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:08.840]   And we're going to see,
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:12.440]   we're already seeing more kids outside.
[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:16.360]   Every day I get emails from grateful parents saying,
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:18.720]   because of your book, I mean, my six-year-old,
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:19.960]   he wanted to ride his bicycle
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.360]   down to the end of our cul-de-sac.
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:24.120]   He wanted to ride down, circle, and come back.
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:25.840]   And I never would let him because I was afraid
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:27.880]   that what would the neighbors say?
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:30.320]   But once I read your book, I decided to let him.
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:31.440]   And he was so ecstatic.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:32.720]   He kept doing it and doing it.
[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:33.800]   And now he's going further
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:35.600]   and he rides to his friends' houses.
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:37.200]   So people in her neighborhood,
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.560]   now they're seeing a kid on a bicycle.
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:41.680]   And if suppose there were 10 kids doing it,
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:43.320]   well, now it's normal.
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:48.240]   So we can renormalize human childhood in the real world
[02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:52.200]   where our kids get the chance to have independent adventures
[02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:56.280]   and learn how to be self-supervising adults ultimately.
[02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:57.560]   We can do this.
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:01.480]   - Okay, so you're a 10 out of 10 on the optimism scale.
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:05.000]   What can we do to facilitate
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.840]   and accelerate this whole process?
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:09.560]   - So once we understand
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:11.640]   that this is a collective action problem,
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:12.800]   that we're all stuck in this
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:14.240]   because everyone else is stuck
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:16.680]   and we can't leave if we're the only ones.
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:17.960]   Once we understand that,
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:20.720]   now you see the key is collective action.
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:23.760]   So talk to your friends about this.
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:24.920]   Talk about the book with them.
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:25.840]   You don't have to buy the book.
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.840]   Just go to anxiousgeneration.com.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:29.480]   We have all kinds of resources.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:33.020]   I have talks where I've summarized the book in videos.
[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:36.160]   Talk about it with your friends.
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:38.240]   Talk about it with your family.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.200]   Talk about it with other parents at the school.
[02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:41.380]   If you're on social media,
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:43.160]   social media is great for adults
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:45.120]   who want to pursue projects.
[02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:47.520]   I just don't think it's good for kids
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:49.540]   to be pursued by the social media companies.
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:51.640]   But if you're on Instagram in particular,
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:54.440]   that's where a lot of parents are, especially mothers.
[02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:55.520]   Talk about these issues.
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:56.820]   Say you're gonna let your kid
[02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:58.100]   have some free-range childhood.
[02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:00.640]   You're gonna try to do these four norms.
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:01.560]   And then if you're able,
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:04.440]   I hope that you'll support the projects.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:06.020]   If you go to anxiousgeneration.com,
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:07.400]   there's a donate button.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:09.920]   NYU has it set up so that people can donate
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:11.160]   into a research account from me,
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:14.080]   and that's what I use to pay my small staff.
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:15.680]   I have about four or five people working for me,
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:17.480]   and I hope to grow that to 10.
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:20.840]   I hope people will donate to me at anxiousgeneration.com.
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:23.720]   Or to Let Grow, this wonderful organization
[02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:25.720]   that advocates for giving playback
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:28.800]   and independence back to kids, letgrow.org.
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:31.600]   And if you know influential people,
[02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:34.160]   if you know state legislators,
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:35.440]   not a lot of, there is some,
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:37.920]   oh, and in Congress, there is a very important bill,
[02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:39.920]   COSA, the Kids' Online Safety Act.
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:41.640]   Contact your legislators about that.
[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:43.040]   Say you support COSA.
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.080]   It could be coming up for a vote very, very soon.
[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:45.920]   This is the one piece
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:47.880]   that really could get through the US Congress.
[02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:49.740]   Beyond the Congress, a lot of states are acting,
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:51.120]   which is very, very exciting.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:53.040]   So make your views known to your state legislators
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:53.880]   if you know them,
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:56.520]   or the mayor or governor if you know them.
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:58.560]   This is a collective action trap.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:00.520]   The only way out is together.
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:02.840]   So if we act together, we can break this.
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:05.440]   - Terrific, and we'll put links to all of those things
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:08.040]   you just mentioned in the show note captions.
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:12.440]   Jonathan, you're bringing the humanity back.
[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:13.920]   It's remarkable.
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:17.720]   And as a fellow academic, I have to say,
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:22.400]   your depth of scholarship in terms of developing
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:24.240]   and researching these ideas,
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:28.920]   but also the vigor and the mission that you have
[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:31.880]   around doing good and making sure that it happens soon
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:33.600]   as opposed to waiting another 10 years
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:38.600]   and seeing just how bad this can get is really inspiring.
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:39.880]   I feel it.
[02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:43.040]   I know for sure that people listening and watching feel it.
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:46.600]   And so I want to thank you for doing this work.
[02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:48.760]   Again, I loved "Coddling in the American Mind"
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:49.920]   because it just woke me up
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:52.960]   to how much things had changed and were changing.
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:54.280]   And it's such an important book.
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:56.940]   And "The Anxious Generation" is truly an important book.
[02:23:56.940 --> 02:23:58.880]   And I don't say that lightly.
[02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:01.040]   It's mission-driven, goal-driven,
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:02.440]   and it has actionable items
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:04.680]   that I'm certain many people listening to this
[02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:07.400]   are going to partake in.
[02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:11.640]   So on behalf of the listeners and viewers and also myself,
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:14.120]   but also the positive change to come,
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:15.200]   I just want to say thank you
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:17.620]   for taking the time out of your very busy schedule.
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:18.560]   You're still a professor.
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:21.800]   You're also a public-facing health science educator.
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:23.000]   - Yeah, like you, yeah.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.660]   - Yeah, so I feel a kinship there.
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:27.560]   For coming here and speaking with us today,
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:29.600]   and we'll provide links to the books
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:32.360]   and to these other resources in the show note captions.
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:34.960]   And we'd love to have you back again,
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:36.720]   hopefully in the not-too-distant future,
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.180]   so that we can review all the progress
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:39.400]   that you've stimulated.
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:40.400]   So thank you so much.
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:41.600]   - Well, thanks so much, Andrew.
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:43.040]   And thanks for all the work that you do
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:46.360]   to make science cool and interesting.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.680]   So I really appreciate your work,
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:50.840]   and I'm very grateful to you for having me on.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:51.680]   - It's been a pleasure.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:52.880]   Thank you.
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:53.720]   Thank you for joining me

[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:40.120]   I do read all the comments.
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:42.300]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:45.340]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:48.380]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now known as X,
[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:50.260]   LinkedIn, Threads, and Facebook.
[02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:51.860]   And on all those platforms,
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:53.820]   I cover science and science-based tools,
[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:55.460]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:56.860]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:25:56.860 --> 02:25:58.780]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:00.300]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast.
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:01.620]   So again, that's "Huberman Lab"
[02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:03.740]   on all social media platforms.
[02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:05.140]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:07.060]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:08.440]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:10.200]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:12.700]   that provides "Huberman Lab" podcast summaries,
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:14.860]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:16.780]   one- to three-page PDFs
[02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:19.760]   with everything from neuroplasticity and learning
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:22.700]   to how to optimize your sleep or optimize your dopamine.
[02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:24.660]   We have protocols for deliberate cold exposure
[02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:25.740]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:27.660]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:29.220]   that spells out resistance training
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:31.940]   and cardiovascular training in detail,
[02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:33.620]   all of which is available at zero cost.
[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:35.500]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:37.740]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:38.900]   and provide your email.
[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:39.740]   And I should point out
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:42.020]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:43.320]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:46.180]   for today's discussion with Dr. Jonathan Haidt.
[02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:48.660]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:50.620]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:53.200]   [upbeat music]
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:55.780]   (upbeat music)
