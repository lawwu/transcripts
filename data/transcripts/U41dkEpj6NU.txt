[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   I've been hosting this podcast called Artificial Intelligence for over two years now.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.240]   And I'm finally ready to release version 2.0 of the podcast with two updates.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.640]   Change podcast name to Lex Friedman Podcast. Very creative. And switch the video to ASCII.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.480]   I may or may not be kidding about the second part, but I'm just excited to have figured out
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.840]   that Mplayer and VLC have a bunch of ASCII video modes, including MatrixView.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.680]   I can make a quick video tutorial on that if people are interested.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.960]   Anyway, I decided to change the name to just Lex Friedman Podcast for several reasons.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.520]   First, that's what most people call it anyway. Second, I've already been interviewing physicists,
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.000]   historians, philosophers, mathematicians, writers, athletes. Switching away from AI in the name
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.080]   gives me the freedom to do that a little bit more. I still want to talk to the top
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.760]   researchers in artificial intelligence and science and tech in general, but also people
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.160]   who inspire me and have had a big impact on my life outside of science and tech.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.080]   Third, most practically, I've found that guests even slightly outside the field of AI like
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.640]   neuroscience, neurobiology, physics, chemistry, math, have been intimidated by the name AI.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.280]   So going with a silly generic name, my name, just seems easier.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.840]   Hopefully you see that I try hard to make the guest the star of the show,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.000]   not to take myself too seriously or seriously at all, and always ask the simplest possible
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.160]   questions in hopes of arriving at something fundamental and even beautiful, even if it
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.280]   makes me look like an idiot, which I very often am. RSS feed is still the same. Everything is
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.240]   still the same. If you enjoy this thing, share it with others. Your kind words as before, as always,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.160]   and your love has been fuel for me, for which I'm forever grateful.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.320]   Version 3.0 will be outside the simulation, but for now, let us stay here a little longer.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.120]   Love you all.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.760]   Bye.
