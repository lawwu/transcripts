[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.800]   All right, second question.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.200]   This comes from Jim, the CFO.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.640]   A technical question.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.200]   Jim asks, "When you develop your weekly plan, do you do your written version first,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.440]   or do you update your Trello board first, or do you do both simultaneously/iteratively?"
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.440]   So this is a great opportunity to plug our core ideas.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.520]   We were just talking about this in the opening of the show.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600]   If you're wondering what Jim is talking about with weekly plans and Trellos and updates,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800]   go to the YouTube page, go to the core ideas playlist,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.000]   watch the core idea on time management, and you'll know exactly what he's talking about.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.280]   All right, so Jim, here's my technical answer.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.920]   When I do my weekly plan, writing out the weekly plan is the last step.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.240]   So I go through a bunch of things.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.480]   I go through my Trello board and do organization there.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.320]   I clean things up and move things around and take things off and see what's going on there.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.360]   I go through my calendar for the week, and I look through my semester plans,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.560]   what other people would call quarterly plans, to remind myself what I'm working on.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.000]   As I do this, I take notes.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.400]   I take it in a text file on my desktop, workingmemory.txt,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.160]   and I'm just taking a bunch of notes.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160]   Oh, here's some tasks as I was organizing my Trello boards.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.320]   Here's some tasks that are important this week.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.600]   I'm looking at my calendar.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.440]   I got to remember these big things.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.920]   Very unstructured here.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.240]   I'm just taking notes of stuff I want to remember,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.920]   and then I use those notes from the workingmemory.txt to write my weekly plan.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.680]   So I do all the steps, look through all my systems, review all my stuff,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.960]   take notes, use the notes to make the weekly plan.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600]   That is how that works.
