[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.980]   - So we're on to our last module of the day
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.760]   before the Q&A session.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.840]   Mike Piper earlier covered
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.060]   investing in tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.540]   In this session, he'll talk about
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.680]   how to invest tax efficiently
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.180]   in non-tax-advantaged accounts,
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.200]   like taxable brokerage accounts.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.240]   We'll bring Mike up here,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.040]   and then we'll do a Q&A after that.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.160]   If you do have a question you'd like to submit,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.800]   it looks like we've been getting a ton.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.400]   Gauri is collecting them,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.040]   and you can just drop off your question with him.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.580]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.400]   - All right, so last time we talked about
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.360]   the different types of tax-advantaged accounts,
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.520]   and Alan and Rick both talked with you
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.920]   about minimizing your investment costs.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.480]   And in that case, they were talking about
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480]   the expense ratios that you pay on your mutual funds.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.160]   But one of the biggest expenses that most investors pay
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.720]   on their investments are the taxes.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.960]   So what we're going to talk about here
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.640]   are the three most impactful things
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.560]   that you can do to minimize that investment cost,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.320]   to minimize the investment taxes
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.400]   that you're going to be paying.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.560]   The first one is pretty straightforward.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.800]   Max out your retirement accounts
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.480]   if you have enough cash flow to do that.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.680]   Second one is fill your Roth accounts
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.000]   with the assets that have the highest expected returns.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200]   And finally, when you're investing in taxable accounts,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560]   try to fill them with things that are tax-efficient.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.640]   So let's go through these one by one.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.320]   Max out your retirement accounts.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.520]   The idea here, generally speaking,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.200]   is to make the maximum contribution every year
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   to a Roth IRA, or if your income is too high,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.800]   then we're looking at maximum backdoor Roth IRA contribution
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.160]   if that's available to you.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.040]   And if you have access to a plan at work
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.280]   and you have enough cash flow
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.240]   to max out that contribution as well, do that.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.840]   And the idea here, the reason for this,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.760]   is exactly what I was talking about
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.520]   last time I was standing here,
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.440]   which is that taxable accounts incur tax drag,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.480]   meaning there's taxes that are dragging down
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.440]   the returns that you earn every year,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.960]   because you're paying tax on the interests,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.160]   you're paying tax on the dividends,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.200]   and you're paying tax on the capital gains
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.160]   every single year, with the net result being
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.400]   that taxable accounts, they literally earn
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.720]   a lower rate of return than retirement accounts.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.440]   And just like Rick was showing you,
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   even a relatively small difference in the annual return
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.600]   has a huge impact when we compound it
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.520]   over an entire investing career.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.120]   And so we max out retirement accounts
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.880]   simply because retirement accounts don't have tax drag.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.440]   You get to keep the full rate of return every year,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.920]   and that's a really big deal.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.280]   Now, one thing that somebody will always ask
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.600]   if you tell a room full of people
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.760]   to max out their retirement accounts
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.640]   is what if I'm planning to retire early, right?
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.360]   'Cause there's the age 59 and a half rule,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.640]   so there might be a 10% penalty.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.080]   So what if I'm planning to retire at age 50, right?
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.600]   Should I still max out my retirement accounts?
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.040]   And the answer, in almost every case
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.040]   where I've done a serious analysis, the answer is yes.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.960]   It still makes sense to make the maximum contributions
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.600]   if you can, if you're planning to retire early.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.840]   And there's a few reasons for that,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.640]   so let's go through them.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.280]   Reason number one is that in order to retire early,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.760]   you have to save and invest a whole lot of money every year.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.440]   That's how early retirement happens.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.320]   You have fewer years to accumulate,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.880]   so fewer years to save,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.120]   and fewer years to earn investment returns,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.480]   and more years of retirement to pay for.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.880]   So the only way to make that happen
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.560]   is by saving a whole darn lot every year.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.600]   And usually what that looks like
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.120]   is maxing out your IRA, maxing out your 401(k),
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.200]   and saving more than that.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.120]   And so in that scenario,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.560]   the more than that pile, the pile number three,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.280]   that's in a taxable account,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   so you'll have some assets that you can tap into
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.640]   that aren't in retirement accounts in the first place.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.800]   The second reason that it still makes sense
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.200]   to max out retirement accounts
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.800]   even if you plan to retire before 59 1/2
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.040]   is this thing that I keep saying, 'cause it's important,
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.640]   is that Roth IRAs, you can take your contribution back out,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.120]   tax-free, penalty-free, at any age.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.880]   You just don't have to be 59 1/2.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.560]   That's not a rule.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.560]   And so you'll have access to this money early.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.320]   And then similarly, a lot of people don't realize this,
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.400]   but with Roth 401(k) and Roth 403(b) plans,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.960]   after you separate from service,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.760]   so after you've left the employer
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.000]   with whom you had that Roth 401(k),
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   you can roll that Roth 401(k) or Roth 403(b),
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.400]   you can roll it over to a Roth IRA,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.320]   and then from that point going forward,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.240]   all the money that had been Roth 401(k) contributions
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.760]   or Roth 403(b) contributions,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.080]   now it counts as if it had been
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.400]   Roth IRA contributions the whole time.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.840]   So again, tax-free, penalty-free access,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.720]   regardless of your age.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.480]   And so you're going to be accumulating
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.800]   a significant amount of money
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.280]   where there's just no 10% penalty to begin with.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.400]   And then there's also the age 55 rule.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.040]   The way this works, so it's specifically
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.440]   for traditional 401(k) and traditional 403(b) plans,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.600]   and this rule basically says
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.720]   that if you separate from service
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.280]   in a year that you turn 55 or older,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.240]   then from that point forward,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.520]   you can take money out of that 401(k)
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.440]   or that 403(b) without a 10% penalty.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.040]   So it's another way to get money out
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.280]   before 59 and a half without a penalty.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.200]   And then we're not gonna go through all of them
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.400]   because there's just a really long list
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.680]   of all of the exceptions,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.760]   and Congress adds more and more and more things
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.640]   to this list every couple of years.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.960]   So the reality is that most of the time,
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.400]   you're gonna have access to money penalty-free
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   even if you retire before 59 and a half.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.400]   You just have a whole lot of options.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.000]   So that's it for our first item,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.800]   max out your retirement accounts.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.320]   Items two and three, fill your Roth accounts
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.240]   with the highest returning assets,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.920]   and when you're investing in a taxable account,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.800]   fill those accounts with tax-efficient stuff.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   I highlighted them both together
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.320]   because together they have a name,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.480]   and that name is asset location.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.920]   And the idea of asset location
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.440]   is basically after you've decided your asset allocation,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.200]   so what Christine and Jim were just talking about,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.040]   so it's this much in US stocks
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.400]   and that much in international stocks
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.160]   and then that much in bonds,
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.520]   then take some time to think about what goes where,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.240]   which thing in which account.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.400]   And so we call that asset location
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.760]   as opposed to asset allocation.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.240]   And the two most important points here
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.080]   are fill your Roth accounts
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.360]   with the stuff you expect to grow the fastest
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.280]   and try not to own anything in a taxable account
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.280]   that's tax-inefficient
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.600]   or try to stick with things that are tax-efficient.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.080]   So to go through those one by one,
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.120]   highest returning assets in Roth.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.960]   The idea here, there's two reasons we wanna do this.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   Reason number one, Roth accounts grow tax-free.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.880]   We don't have to pay tax on it every year.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.040]   And if you meet the appropriate requirements,
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.080]   you never have to pay tax on all of the growth.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.080]   So that's a good thing.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.800]   Reason number two is that unlike tax-deferred accounts,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.520]   Roth accounts don't have RMDs at all.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.400]   You're never forced to take the money out
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.920]   during your lifetime.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.760]   And so with those two points combined,
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.520]   the takeaway is that if you could choose one type of account
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.760]   that you would want to grow the fastest,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.120]   you would want your Roth accounts to grow the fastest.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.640]   Like if you could have a pile of money
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.960]   in one type of account, Roth account, that's the answer.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.520]   And so really all this means
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   is that you wanna fill your Roth accounts with stocks
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.760]   because that's what grows the fastest.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.520]   So the reasoning might be complicated,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   but the to-do list item is really easy.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.160]   You just have a total stock market index fund
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.080]   in your Roth accounts
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.960]   or total international or a combination thereof.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.440]   That's basically the gist of it.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.120]   The third item, when investing in taxable accounts,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.680]   use tax-efficient funds.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.360]   There's a little more going on here,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.960]   so we have to dig into this one.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.000]   Basically, there's a few characteristics that are good
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   and a few characteristics that are bad
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.480]   for a taxable account.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.360]   One thing that's good is low turnover
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.440]   in the portfolio of the mutual fund.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.800]   So portfolio turnover is just what it sounds like.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.760]   It's when the fund sells something to buy something else,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.280]   that's turnover.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.680]   And the reason that that's so important
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.000]   in a taxable account
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   is that if you own a mutual fund in a taxable account,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.920]   if the fund sells something for a gain,
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.240]   so the fund sells an investment
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.600]   for more than what the fund paid for it,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.000]   if you're a shareholder of that fund,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.520]   you have to pay tax on your share of the gain.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.000]   So even though you didn't sell anything at all,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.920]   the fund sold something and now you have a tax cost.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.720]   So the more often the fund is selling stuff,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.200]   the more often you'll have those tax costs.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.080]   And we call those capital gain distributions.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.000]   That's just the tax term for the capital gains
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.520]   that you have to pay tax on
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.920]   even though you didn't sell anything.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.720]   And the other important point here
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.440]   is that the higher the rate of the turnover
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.560]   within the portfolio of the mutual fund,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.520]   the more likely it is that the capital gains
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.440]   will be short-term capital gains.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.320]   So remember that's when an investment is sold
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.600]   after being owned for one year or less,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.920]   that's a short-term gain.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.000]   And those are taxed at higher tax rates than long-term gains.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.080]   So the more frequently the fund is selling stuff,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   the more often, just that's the way the math works,
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.440]   the more often the capital gains will be short-term
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.480]   and you're gonna have to pay a higher tax rate.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.760]   And so two examples here,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.520]   at the very tax efficient end of the spectrum,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.720]   we have total stock market funds, index funds and ETFs,
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.960]   because they've got a super low rate of turnover.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.040]   And that's simply just because if you think about
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.280]   the investment strategy of a total stock market fund,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.320]   it's just buy all of the stocks and that's it,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.520]   that's the whole strategy.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   And that requires very little selling every year,
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.200]   almost none in fact.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.160]   And so total stock market funds have very low turnover
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.600]   and they're very tax efficient,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.240]   they're a good fit for a taxable account.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.640]   And then at the other end of the spectrum,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.160]   something that's really bad for a taxable account
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.440]   is an actively managed fund
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.200]   with a really high rate of turnover.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.800]   So the classic example there, if you imagine,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.160]   it's a mutual fund and the fund manager
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.240]   is just trying to own the stocks that he or she thinks
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.800]   are the very best ones right at this minute.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.440]   And so they're just constantly buying and selling
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.080]   and buying and selling and buying and selling,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.440]   there's gonna be a ton of capital gains every year,
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.000]   a bunch of them are gonna be short-term
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.640]   and it's gonna create a ton of costs
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.360]   if you own it in a taxable account.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.440]   And moving on to the bond side of the portfolio,
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.120]   the general rule is that safer bonds have lower yields,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.440]   because riskier bonds have to pay a higher interest rate
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.600]   to get people to buy them.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.720]   So safer bonds have lower yields,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.040]   which means less taxable income,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.400]   which means less tax,
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.960]   which means they're more tax efficient.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.520]   So safer bonds tend to be more tax efficient
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.640]   than riskier bonds.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.760]   And so short-term bonds tend to be more tax efficient
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.440]   than long-term bonds because short-term bonds
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.960]   usually pay a lower rate of interest.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.840]   There are exceptions and we are currently living
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.200]   in one of those exceptions,
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.480]   but typically short-term bonds have a lower interest rate
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.320]   than long-term bonds,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.200]   which usually makes them a better fit
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.320]   for a taxable account.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.240]   And then with regard to credit quality,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.440]   so the credit rating of the bond,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.600]   the higher the credit rating,
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.360]   the lower the interest rate
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.080]   and therefore the lower the taxable income that it creates
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.800]   and the lower the tax costs.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.080]   So bonds with better credit ratings are more tax efficient
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.920]   than bonds with worse credit ratings.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   And so treasury bonds,
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.440]   those are the bonds that have
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.640]   the very highest credit rating of all,
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.040]   they tend to be really tax efficient
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.720]   relative to other bonds.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.880]   In addition, treasury bonds are exempt
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.840]   from state income tax,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.960]   or specifically the interest that you get on treasury bonds
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.560]   is exempt from state income tax.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.120]   So if you live in a state where you're paying
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   a significant income tax rate,
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.280]   that's another point in favor of treasury bonds
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.800]   being a good fit for a taxable account.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.480]   And then lastly, we have municipal bonds,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.200]   AKA muni bonds.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.520]   And those are bonds that are issued
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.400]   by state and local government entities.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.800]   And the interest on them is exempt from federal income tax.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.680]   And in many cases,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.940]   if you buy muni bonds from within your own state,
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.120]   then that interest is going to be exempt
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.760]   from your state income tax also.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.300]   Now granted, there's some risk involved, right?
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.680]   Because muni bonds have some credit risk
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.960]   much more than treasury bonds.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.400]   And if you're specifically limiting it
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.200]   to only ones in your state,
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.560]   you're kind of compounding that risk
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.000]   'cause there's a little bit less diversification
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   going on there.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.040]   But they can be a very tax efficient choice.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.400]   Now, one thing you'll have to decide
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   if you have taxable assets
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.520]   is do you want stocks or bonds in the taxable account?
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.080]   And one very important factor here
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.360]   is that the returns you get from stocks
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.960]   are dividends and capital gains, right?
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.520]   Those are the two ways that stocks provide returns.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.800]   And both of those things have tax advantaged treatment,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.640]   right?
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.160]   There's lower tax rates for dividends
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.240]   and long-term capital gains
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.200]   than there are for most other types of income.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.320]   And so, in general, stocks tend to be a better fit
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.840]   than bonds for a taxable account,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.400]   although there are some exceptions.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.240]   Now, moving on to things
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.120]   that we specifically want to avoid in a taxable account.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.000]   One of them, Jim talked about this, all-in-one funds.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.320]   So that's anything that owns stocks and bonds altogether.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.960]   They're not, so a target date fund,
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.840]   balanced fund, that sort of thing.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.160]   They generally aren't a good fit for a taxable account,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.600]   although there are some exceptions,
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.280]   just like most of the stuff I'm saying.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.240]   And the reason for that, number one,
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.720]   is that the bond side of the portfolio
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.960]   is going to include some corporate bonds,
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.880]   which have a higher rate of interest,
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.000]   more taxable income, more tax.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.240]   And so, basically, the idea here
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.320]   is that they own some stuff
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.720]   that you'd rather not own in a taxable account,
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.080]   so it's not a great fit.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.280]   The other point, and Jim also mentioned this,
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.120]   is that sometimes the outer layer of fund,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.920]   the all-in-one fund itself,
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.400]   creates another level of turnover.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.080]   So if you think about, for instance,
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.720]   Vanguard target date fund,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.560]   most of them own four underlying mutual funds.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.960]   You've got a total U.S. stock fund,
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   a total international stock fund,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.240]   a total U.S. bond fund,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.640]   and a total international bond fund.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.520]   And so each of those four funds
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.880]   will have its own level of turnover,
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.680]   whatever it happens to be,
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.600]   and you'll have whatever tax cost you have from that.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.040]   But then the target date fund itself
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.560]   is going to have some turnover,
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.760]   because sometimes it sells one of those four funds.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.480]   And that could be just the little rebalancing
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.400]   from day-to-day, but the bigger issue
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.040]   is what we saw from Vanguard a couple of years ago,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.840]   where they just changed their mind.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.600]   They decided, all right, we're kicking out this fund
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.960]   and adding this other one instead,
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.440]   and people weren't expecting that,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.520]   and so anyone who owned it in a taxable account
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.240]   had a big tax cost every year.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.520]   There were lawsuits about it.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.640]   And that's not only Vanguard, by the way.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.040]   Any fund company could do that,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.600]   and sometimes does do that.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.880]   So if you have a fund like a target date fund,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.480]   you're exposing yourself to that risk
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.080]   that they're just going to change their mind,
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.400]   and then you've got some taxes to pay.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.560]   So all-in-one funds are not usually a great fit
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.680]   for a taxable account.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.240]   Real estate investment trusts, REITs,
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.520]   Jim talked about those.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.840]   They're just stocks in the real estate industry.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.560]   They typically aren't a good fit for a taxable account,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.960]   because they generally pay a higher level of dividends
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.240]   than most stocks, so more taxable income.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.520]   And those dividends are taxed at a higher tax rate
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.920]   than other dividends.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.840]   So more income, higher tax rate, not a great fit.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.960]   They are a perfectly fine thing to own.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   It's just if you own them,
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.440]   you want them in a retirement account
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.960]   and not in a taxable account.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.120]   So just to summarize here.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.320]   Things that are tax-efficient.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.280]   We've got total stock market funds.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   They have a very low rate of turnover,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.320]   'cause the fund hardly ever has to sell anything.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.000]   So that low rate of turnover makes them very tax-efficient.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.920]   Treasury bonds are typically tax-efficient as bonds go,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.680]   because their high credit rating
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.920]   makes for relatively less taxable income,
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.240]   and because their interest is exempt from state income tax.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.120]   Municipal bonds are a good fit for a taxable account,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.280]   because their interest is exempt from federal income tax
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.080]   and potentially state income tax
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.960]   if you buy bonds from within your own state.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.400]   And shorter-term bonds tend to be more tax-efficient
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.320]   than longer-term bonds,
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.080]   because they typically pay a lower rate of interest.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.560]   And then stuff you want to avoid in a taxable account,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.320]   things that are tax-inefficient.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.760]   Number one, actively managed stock funds with high turnover.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.320]   All of that buying and selling creates costs
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.360]   to you as the investor,
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.440]   because you have to pay tax
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.000]   every time they sell something for a gain,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.680]   and you've got no control over it.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.520]   High-yield bonds, junk bonds.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.880]   They pay a lot of interest.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.560]   That's a lot of taxable income.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.240]   That's not good.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   All-in-one funds, again, not a great fit,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.000]   because they own some bonds with higher yields,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.240]   which you'd rather not own in a taxable account,
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.480]   and because you don't have control over the turnover.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.120]   The fund can sell something,
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.760]   can sell one of the underlying funds,
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.720]   and then you've got a big tax cost to pay.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.160]   And real estate investment trusts,
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.000]   just because relative to other stocks,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.200]   they pay more dividends,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.160]   and those dividends are taxed at a higher tax rate.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.480]   So the way this whole asset location thing typically looks,
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.640]   you've got your Roth account,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.560]   and you fill it up with the highest returning asset, stocks.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.840]   And again, that doesn't have to be complicated.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.360]   Total stock market fund, and you're done.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.040]   Or total international, or total world, whatever,
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.440]   just a basic stock fund and call it a day.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.560]   And then the tax-deferred account
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.240]   usually owns a mix of stocks and bonds.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.200]   And the reason for that is that, remember,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.760]   our rules are highest returning assets in Roth,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.640]   tax-efficient stuff, and taxable.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.600]   There's no rules about tax-deferred.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.320]   Anything is a fine fit for tax-deferred.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.200]   So the job of the tax-deferred accounts
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.120]   is basically just to own whatever else we need to own
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.640]   to get the overall asset allocation for the portfolio
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.440]   to be what we want it to be.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.880]   So because we filled up the Roth account with stocks,
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.240]   so there's no bonds there,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.800]   and we probably want some bonds in the portfolio,
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.440]   we put bonds in the tax-deferred account.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.720]   And then if there's also more space,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.680]   we put some more stocks in there.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.520]   That's basically the idea.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.760]   And then in the taxable account,
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.080]   we want to stick with things that are tax-efficient.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.800]   So low turnover funds, like total stock market funds.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.320]   And with regard to bonds,
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.400]   treasury bonds, because of their lower rate of interest
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.640]   and their exemption from state income tax.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.280]   And muni bonds, because of their exemption
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.360]   from federal income tax and potentially state income tax.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.880]   So that's it.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.040]   (audience applauding)
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   (audience cheering)
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
