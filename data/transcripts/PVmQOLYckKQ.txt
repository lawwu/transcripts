[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.220]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.720]   Today, we are discussing how to build
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.780]   a strong, pain-free back.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.800]   Having a strong, pain-free back has numerous advantages,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.300]   not the least of which is you're not in pain,
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.120]   as well as the fact that you can carry out
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.440]   your daily activities,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.440]   any exercise or sports you might play,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.000]   interactions with family members,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.200]   like picking up a kid,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.480]   leaning down to get things out of a cupboard,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.800]   or reaching up to get things out of a cabinet
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.740]   without any pain.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.280]   And back pain is one of those things
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.700]   that even if minor, and certainly if severe,
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.720]   severely impedes our ability to do most everything,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.480]   even to just sit still or lay still.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.920]   And one of the things about pain,
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.480]   in particular back and neck pain,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.700]   is that it also has an effect on our emotional self.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.280]   It makes us more irritable.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.480]   It makes any activity, even the most mundane activities,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.160]   that much more distressing to carry out.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.440]   So during today's discussion,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.880]   we will talk about how to ameliorate pain.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.000]   However, pain as a general topic
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.920]   was already covered on this podcast
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.980]   with an expert guest, Dr. Sean Mackey,
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.620]   who's a medical doctor at Stanford.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.520]   He's actually the director of our pain clinic.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.680]   And on that episode,
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.240]   which we provide a link to in the show note captions,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.040]   he talks about the various ways to address pain,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.720]   everything from pain medication, to epidurals,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.560]   to electrical stimulation,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.160]   and importantly, the biopsychosocial model of pain,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.120]   whereby our thoughts and our perceptions about pain
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120]   actually influence the severity
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.240]   and the duration of that pain.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.580]   So if you're interested in pain
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.120]   and the treatment of pain per se,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.120]   I highly recommend that episode.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.720]   Today, we will certainly talk about
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.240]   ways to deal with back pain,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.600]   ways to reduce it,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.320]   and perhaps even eliminate it altogether.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.360]   But we are also going to talk a lot about
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.080]   how to pain-proof your back
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.420]   and how to build a really strong back,
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.180]   not just for pulling things,
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.000]   because the back muscles are involved in pulling things,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   but also just for generating a really strong, stable core,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.980]   strong spinal erectors,
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.000]   making sure that your pelvis and your spine
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.320]   are interacting correctly,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.680]   that your shoulders, neck, and spine, and pelvis,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.560]   and even your lower limbs and feet
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   are working together in the proper manner
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.720]   to make sure that you have the strongest
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.120]   and most pain-free back possible.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.360]   So what I'm going to do
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.840]   is first I'm going to describe
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.580]   a bit of back anatomy and physiology.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.240]   I'm going to talk about the neuromuscular components
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.660]   as well as the spinal and disc components.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.040]   I promise, even if you don't have a background in biology,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   I'm going to make this all very accessible
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.400]   to any and all of you.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.140]   And then I'm going to go into
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.860]   the 10 or 12 specific things,
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.420]   in particular, six things that take very little time
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.720]   that require no equipment,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.600]   no purchase of anything whatsoever,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.160]   and involve a very minimal time investment
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.080]   that will allow you to build a really strong, pain-free back.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.560]   What's covered are protocols
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.000]   from three of the world's foremost experts in back pain,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.800]   but also back strengthening
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.560]   and building resilience into the back.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.320]   So they include a medical doctor,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.480]   expert in back strengthening and rehabilitation,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.760]   a PhD researcher who has spent decades
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.320]   researching the spine
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.760]   and ways to strengthen the core and spine,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.420]   and a world-class PhD physical therapist
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.200]   who is expert not just in the spine,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.800]   but in fact, in the movement, rehabilitation,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.960]   and strengthening of the entire body.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.280]   They are the MD, Dr. Sean Miller,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.040]   the PhD, Dr. Stuart McGill,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.920]   and also the PhD, Dr. Kelly Starrett.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.200]   I provide links to them
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.840]   and resources that they provide in the show note captions.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.440]   And indeed, I plan to host all three of them separately
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.840]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.280]   as expert guests in the not too distant future.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.120]   Before we begin,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.820]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.640]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.760]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.740]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.740]   about science and science related tools
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.080]   to the general public.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.140]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.920]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.920]   Our first sponsor is AeroPress.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.520]   AeroPress is like a French press,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.920]   but a French press that always brews
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.200]   the perfect cup of coffee,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.600]   meaning no bitterness and excellent taste.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.720]   AeroPress achieves this
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.880]   because it uses a very short contact time
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.600]   between the hot water and the coffee.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.240]   And that short contact time also means
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   that you can brew an excellent cup of coffee very quickly.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.880]   The whole thing takes only about three minutes.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.320]   I started using AeroPress over 10 years ago,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.620]   and I learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler,
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.360]   who's a former Stanford engineer,
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.400]   who's also an inventor.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   He developed things like the Arobi Frisbee.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.680]   In any event, I'm a big fan of Adler inventions.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   And when I heard he developed a coffee maker,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.440]   the AeroPress, I tried it,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.820]   and I found that indeed,
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.120]   it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.360]   It's also extremely small and portable.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.040]   So I started using it in the laboratory
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.200]   when I travel on the road and also at home.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.160]   And I'm not alone in my love of the AeroPress coffee maker.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.800]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.780]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.080]   If you'd like to try AeroPress,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.720]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.240]   AeroPress currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.400]   and to over 60 other countries around the world.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.680]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.860]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.040]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.080]   on this podcast,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.640]   it's the incredible role that light can have on our biology.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.160]   And of course, I'm always telling people
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.760]   that they should get sunlight in their eyes
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.240]   as soon as possible after waking
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.680]   on as many days of their life as possible
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.200]   for sake of setting circadian rhythm,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.320]   daytime mood focus and alertness, and improve sleep.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.120]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.880]   red light and near-infrared light
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.320]   has been shown to have positive effects
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.680]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.060]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.200]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.940]   even improvements in acne, or that is removal of acne,
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.700]   reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.540]   improving mitochondrial function,
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.100]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100]   What sets Juve apart
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.420]   and why it's my preferred red light therapy device
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.340]   is that it has clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.140]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.380]   and near-infrared light in combination
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.000]   that trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.140]   Personally, I use the Juve handheld light
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.660]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.020]   It's only about the size of a sandwich.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.660]   It's very convenient to use.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.700]   I also have a Juve whole body panel
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.420]   and I use that about three or four times a week.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.540]   If you would like to try Juve,
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.700]   you can go to joovv.com/huberman.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.460]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.180]   to all Huberman Lab listeners
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.700]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.780]   Again, that's Juve, joovv.com/huberman
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.740]   to get $400 off select Juve products.
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.860]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.340]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.420]   that offers hundreds of guided meditations,
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.460]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.820]   I started meditating over three decades ago.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.660]   And what I found in the ensuing years
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.740]   is that sometimes it was very easy for me
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.460]   to do my daily meditation practice.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.060]   I was just really diligent.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.860]   But then as things would get more stressful,
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.860]   which of course is exactly
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.860]   when I should have been meditating more,
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.040]   my meditation practice would fall off.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.580]   With Waking Up, they make it very easy to find
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.060]   and consistently use a given meditation practice.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.860]   It has very convenient reminders
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.660]   and they come in different durations.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.100]   So even if you just have one minute
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.420]   or five minutes to meditate,
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.860]   you can still get your meditation in,
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.700]   which research shows is still highly beneficial.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.500]   In addition to the many different meditations
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.780]   on the Waking Up app,
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.660]   they also have yoga nidra sessions,
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.940]   which are a form of non-sleep deep rest
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.580]   that I personally find is extremely valuable
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.560]   for restoring mental and physical vigor.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.980]   I tend to do a yoga nidra
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.100]   lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes at least once a day.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.180]   And if I ever wake up in the middle of the night
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.620]   and I need to fall back asleep,
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.380]   I also find yoga nidra to be extremely useful.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.320]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.300]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.160]   to try a free 30 day trial.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.340]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.100]   Okay, let's talk about the back.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.740]   The back for many people simply means the spine,
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.340]   the bony stuff that runs down your middle.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.720]   Now, of course your spine doesn't just run down your middle.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.860]   You've got your cervical spine, up near your neck.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.780]   Don't ever forget that.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.780]   Your neck is the upper part of your spine.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.460]   You've got the thoracic spine,
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.860]   which is essentially through, you know,
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.580]   in insects we think of the thorax.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.020]   Remember that from biology class
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.460]   in middle school or high school?
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.540]   But through your region here, you know,
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.780]   basically down from the neck through the chest,
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.820]   and then you've got your lumbar spine,
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.180]   which is the part right below that.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.540]   And then you have the sacral spine,
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.780]   which is the area of the spine that is in the pelvic region.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.900]   And then of course there's the bottom region of that,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.720]   which is called the coccyx spine,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.420]   which is the very lowest part
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.340]   of the sacral region of the spine.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.940]   Now, of course, that's the bony stuff.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.560]   And if you've ever seen a spine on a, you know,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.380]   a skeleton of any kind or a drawing of a skeleton,
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.860]   you know that it's a bunch of segments.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.820]   It's a bunch of bony segments.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.060]   It's important to understand that the back is made up
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.660]   not just of bony stuff,
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.860]   but it's got stuff in between, which are the discs.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.740]   The discs are the soft tissue
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.620]   that sit between the vertebrae, right?
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.780]   The vertebrae are the bones.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.260]   And those discs have some durability to them.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.720]   They're not easily squished, but they can be squished.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   That is, they can move.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.640]   They're a soft tissue that allows for mobility
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.160]   of the bony stuff.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.520]   So you've got basically bone disc, bone disc,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.640]   bone disc, bone disc.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.240]   And it's those discs that allow for movement of the spine
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.160]   from side to side.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.120]   And it actually allows for some compression
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.200]   along the length of the spine as well.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.320]   What sometimes today I'll refer to as vertical compression,
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.160]   but actually vertical isn't the correct anatomical term.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.840]   So in anatomical terms, we talk about anterior-posterior.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.640]   We talk about rostral caudal,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.340]   which is just different language for anterior-posterior.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.880]   I'm going to try and avoid using fancy nomenclature
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.240]   as much as possible.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.760]   But the point here is that those discs
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.980]   allow for movement of the vertebrae.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.600]   But keep in mind that the vertebrae and the discs
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.200]   have a hole down the middle.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.640]   They look like doughnuts, basically.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.140]   They're not perfectly round like doughnuts,
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.200]   but for the time being,
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.420]   just think of them as doughnuts, right?
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.880]   Some are bony doughnuts
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.300]   and others have more pliability to them,
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.860]   but there's a hole down their middle.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.700]   Why?
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.700]   Well, within that hole is a long snake-like piece
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.920]   of the nervous system called the spinal cord,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.200]   which is the neural stuff, the neurons.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.840]   Now, within the spinal cord, it's not just neurons,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.160]   nerve cells, okay, neurons means nerve cells.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.920]   It's also glia, which are another cell type
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.080]   that provides, yes, support to the neurons,
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.100]   but also do some really important things on their own,
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.160]   like clearing out a metabolic waste.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.840]   They actually regulate communication between neurons.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.680]   If you've ever heard that the glia are just glue,
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.160]   and that's actually the Latin translation of glia, glue,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.260]   it implies that they're not doing much actively,
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.020]   that they're just sort of a passive participant
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.860]   keeping things together.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.320]   The glia are really doing important things as well.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.840]   But keep in mind that the spinal cord
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.440]   is this long snake-like process of the nervous system
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.520]   that extends down through the vertebrae
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.060]   and down through the discs.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.040]   Or if you prefer, you can think about
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.360]   the long snake-like process of the spinal cord,
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.920]   and then around it, all along its length,
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.280]   you have bony vertebrae, disc, bony vertebrae, disc,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.320]   bony vertebrae, disc, going all the way
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.040]   from the neck region down to that coccyx region
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.200]   within the pelvis.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.520]   Now, the thing about neural tissue is it's very soft.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.960]   It's very fragile.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.800]   And one of the reasons we have vertebra
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.500]   is to give the spinal cord some rigidity
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.240]   and protection from damage.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.180]   And that's really important because the spinal cord,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.160]   this long tube of neural tissue that sits inside
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.800]   of the vertebrae and the discs,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.760]   it's central nervous system tissue, CNS tissue.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.080]   And as CNS tissue, it does not regenerate after injury.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.480]   It may be a tiny bit in certain conditions
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.140]   and in very young people,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.440]   but if the spinal cord is damaged,
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.240]   typically there's a lot of scar tissue that forms,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.600]   but there is no renewal of the neurons that are damaged.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.160]   So it's very important that the spinal cord be protected
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.560]   which is one of the reasons why it is encased
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.720]   by those vertebrae and the discs.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.680]   Now, the other thing to understand is that the spinal cord
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.480]   is indeed a snake-like extension out the back of the brain.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.400]   So the brain and spinal cord make up
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.400]   what we call the central nervous system, the CNS.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.240]   We just talked about that a moment ago.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.720]   But now I want you to think about the brain.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.240]   Your brain, of course, is encapsulated within the skull,
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.060]   the cranial vault.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.600]   There are only two pieces of your brain
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   that reside outside of the cranial vault.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.120]   They are your neural retinas that line the back of your eyes
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.000]   I know many of you have heard me say this before,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.880]   but it's so cool that I can't help
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.400]   but share it again and again,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.800]   which is that you have two pieces of your brain,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.060]   literally your central nervous system
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.600]   that were extruded out from the cranial vault
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.440]   during development while you were in utero.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.940]   This happens in the first trimester when you were an embryo
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.180]   that line the back of your eyes like a pie crust.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.640]   And those linings of the back of your eye like a pie crust
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.480]   are made up of three layers of neurons
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.160]   and a bunch of glia, and they are your neural retinas.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.400]   They are two pieces of brain that literally look out
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.320]   into the world and are activated by what?
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.120]   By light, by sunlight, by edges and objects,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.840]   by the photons in the outside world.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.520]   And that's what gives rise to vision.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.160]   So starting at the front of your head
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.760]   and working down through the spinal cord,
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.660]   we can do this very quickly to give you a complete picture.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.800]   You've got your neural retinas
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.240]   that line the back of your eyes.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.460]   They are central nervous system.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.760]   They are brain.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.320]   They communicate with the rest of your brain
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.280]   through the optic nerves.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.680]   Then you've got your brain.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.120]   You've got the brain parts that respond to hearing,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.720]   the brain parts that allow you to think,
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.840]   imagine, learn, remember, et cetera.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.800]   And then at the back of the brain, you have the brain stem.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.340]   And then extending out from the brain stem,
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.420]   you have the spinal cord, this tube-like neural structure
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.140]   that extends down through the vertebrae,
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.400]   down through the discs, all the way to your pelvic region.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.200]   Now, why am I telling you all this neuroscience?
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.840]   If we're talking about strengthening the back,
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.760]   why am I talking about the spinal cord?
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.900]   Why am I talking about neurons in the brain?
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.640]   Well, just as your brain has the cranial vault,
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.580]   your skull, to protect it,
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.000]   your spinal cord has the vertebrae to protect it
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.360]   and the discs to protect it,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.720]   but the discs allow for some movement of the spinal cord.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.120]   In fact, quite a bit of movement.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.960]   If you just lean forward in your chair,
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.880]   you lean back, arch your back, or you twist to the side,
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.120]   your spinal cord is actually twisting in that way.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.840]   Okay, this would be akin to your brain
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.800]   actually moving within the skull.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.640]   It can move a little bit,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.480]   but it doesn't move nearly as much as your spinal cord does.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.900]   So your back has, of course, many functions.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.780]   It's there to stabilize your body.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.220]   It's there to provide stiffness
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.740]   in order to be able to move your limbs in very dynamic ways.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.600]   We're going to talk about back and core stiffness
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.300]   as such a key feature of having a strong back.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.460]   When you hear the word stiffness,
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.180]   you probably think, well, that can't be good.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.580]   I don't want a stiff back, ah.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.900]   But you actually want to be able to generate rigidity
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.400]   within your core and spine
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.340]   in order to move your limbs, to throw a ball,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.660]   or to do a martial arts punch, or to even dance gracefully,
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.900]   or even just move up some stairs without falling.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.500]   So basically when we talk about the brain and spinal cord
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.260]   as extending down through the vertebrae
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.260]   and through the discs,
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.980]   we're doing that to set up the other piece
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.060]   of this whole story,
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.780]   which is that the neurons that reside in the spinal cord,
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.800]   in particular, what we call the ventral spinal cord,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   which if we're going to imagine this
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.600]   in kind of more real-world terms,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.020]   they're sitting in the part of the spinal cord
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.980]   that's kind of on your front, okay,
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.300]   that's facing the front of the world.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.400]   There are neurons that are called motor neurons.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.900]   The motor neurons themselves,
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.660]   what we call the cell bodies, reside in the spinal cord,
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.420]   in the so-called ventral horn of the spinal cord.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.540]   You can look this up if you like,
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.700]   although you don't need to know that.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.160]   And they extend little wires that we call axons
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.580]   out to the muscles.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.340]   And through the release of neurotransmitters,
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.460]   they allow our muscles to move,
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.320]   our flexors to flex, like our bicep,
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.100]   our extensors to extend, like our tricep.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.860]   Could think quadricep, hamstring, calf, abdominal muscles,
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.180]   all the movement of those muscles is controlled
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.920]   by neurons that reside within the spinal cord.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.800]   Some of the movements that we generate
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.080]   are unconscious movements,
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.760]   especially movements that are required for breathing,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.080]   although you can consciously take care
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.540]   of your breathing as well, right?
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.920]   You can breathe unconsciously.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.120]   You're always doing that, even in sleep,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.360]   or you can take conscious control of your breathing.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.400]   You can generate limb movements consciously,
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.840]   or you can generate limb movements unconsciously.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.220]   Typically, once you know how to walk
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.640]   and you get up and you walk across the room,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.980]   you're not thinking right foot, left foot,
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.080]   right foot, left foot.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.880]   All of that's handled by motor neurons
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.600]   and what are called central pattern generators
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.760]   in the spinal cord, and to some extent, the brainstem.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.900]   But the commands for specific deliberate movements
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.920]   that you're thinking about,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.500]   especially when you're trying to learn a movement
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.980]   or you're trying to be very deliberate in a movement,
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.640]   those come from what are called upper motor neurons
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.480]   in the brain.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.140]   They communicate with lower motor neurons,
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.980]   which then communicate with the muscles, okay?
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.320]   So that's one neural outflow pathway
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.600]   from spinal cord out to muscles.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.200]   Some of it's conscious, some of it's unconscious.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.320]   And then there are the neural pathways from skin,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.040]   from the tendons and insertions of the muscles onto bone,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.200]   within the muscles that register how much stretch
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.720]   are on our muscles.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.000]   And those are the so-called sensory inputs
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.440]   that come into the dorsal part of the spinal cord,
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.800]   the part that is facing toward our back.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.160]   And that sensory information tells our spinal cord,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.120]   which then informs our brain,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.620]   whether or not our limbs are extended too far
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.760]   and about to snap,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.600]   or whether or not a muscle is loaded too heavy
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.940]   and is about to be pulled off the bone.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.760]   And in that case, the brain and spinal cord
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.800]   have these magnificent mechanisms to shut down the neurons
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.000]   so that we drop the load,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.680]   so that we don't overwhelm the muscle
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.560]   and rip it off the bone,
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.620]   or we don't stretch our limbs too far.
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.960]   Now, keep in mind that the neurons within the spinal cord
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.720]   that communicate with muscles,
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.060]   or the neurons that innervate, as we call it,
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.800]   the skin or the tendons or different parts of the body
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.340]   and go into the spinal cord,
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.480]   those little wires, those axons,
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.480]   literally leave the spinal cord
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.660]   and they go out into what's called
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.640]   the peripheral nervous system.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.400]   Now, a big source of pain in back pain
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.640]   is when those nerve roots, as they're called,
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.760]   they're little bundles, okay?
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.880]   Bundles of nerves are sometimes called fascicles,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.720]   sometimes called nerve roots.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.440]   The nomenclature kind of depends
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.160]   on where you are in the nervous system,
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.720]   but I'll call them nerve roots or bundles of nerves.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.540]   Those bundles of nerves are sometimes impinged on,
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.440]   they're physically pressed on by say a bulging,
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.760]   what's also called a herniated disc.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.500]   The discs can sometimes bulge out
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.680]   from the side of the spine a little bit too much, okay?
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.280]   Maybe by compression from the overlying vertebrae,
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.620]   maybe from some inflammation.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.280]   We'll talk about the various sources today.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.080]   And oftentimes the source of back pain or neck pain,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.760]   or even pain in the pelvic region
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.180]   is because of a compression of the nerve roots
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.940]   that are going into and out of the spine, okay?
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.880]   So when we talk today about back pain,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.960]   and when we talk today about building a strong back,
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.000]   we need to focus on two major themes.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.640]   One is the extent to which those nerve roots
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.320]   are free and clear of any physical pressure
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.800]   from say herniated discs, from compressed vertebrae,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.260]   from inflammation in those regions, maybe all three.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.860]   And what we're really trying to do
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.960]   when we talk about relieving back pain often
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.400]   is creating space, creating room for those nerve roots
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.360]   to travel in and out of the spine,
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.200]   for those messages to come in from the periphery,
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.280]   the skin, the tendons, the muscles, et cetera,
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.080]   up into the brain because the brain needs that information
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.720]   to know where our limbs are, still needs to keep us safe,
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.480]   as well as the nerve pathways traveling out of the spine
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.360]   that control our musculature for deliberate movements,
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.200]   unconscious movements, and so on.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.880]   And so much of what you'll hear about today
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.080]   when thinking about how to build
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.340]   a really strong pain-free back
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.300]   is about creating the kind of stability around the spine
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.520]   so that we can engage in the different limb movements
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.240]   that we need to, but to do so in a way
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.400]   that doesn't create compression of those nerve pathways.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   Now, with all that said, it's really important
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.840]   to also understand that not all of back pain
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.920]   is neural in nature.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.400]   Now, technically all pain is neural
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.720]   in the sense that it's a perception, okay?
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.760]   If you listen to the episode with Dr. Sean Mackey,
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.380]   which includes a deep description
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.880]   of the biopsychosocial model of pain,
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.360]   it will tell you, or I'll just tell you now,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.680]   that indeed pain involves a lot of different things.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.820]   It involves psychology, it involves prediction,
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.920]   it involves history, it involves inflammation,
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.720]   it involves a lot of things.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.060]   And yes, ultimately it's neural.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.400]   It is the firing of nerves
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.920]   that create the perception of pain,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.140]   and your perception of pain is also the firing of neurons
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.760]   in your brain and spinal cord.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.920]   However, what you'll also learn today
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.000]   is that there are many things that you can do,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.080]   including creating stability of your feet,
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.920]   your toes, believe it or not,
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.360]   the position of your pelvis, your neck, your chin,
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.540]   all these things,
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.600]   as well as the spinal erector muscles in your lower back,
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.400]   as well as your abdominal region, your so-called core,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.880]   all of those things combine to create a milieu
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.160]   for the spine and back to function at its best.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.680]   So if by now you're getting overwhelmed,
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.640]   you're thinking, "Oh my goodness,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.440]   we have to learn about the entire bodies,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.600]   physiology and anatomy,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.320]   in order to understand back pain and strengthening."
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.840]   To some extent that's true,
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.240]   but really all we've said so far,
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.220]   and all you need to know or keep in mind that is,
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.960]   is we have the vertebrae,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.480]   the bony segments that surround the spinal cord,
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.160]   in between those we have the discs,
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.720]   the soft tissue that also have a hole through them,
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.520]   the spinal cord travels through that,
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.940]   so that the vertebrae can move,
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.520]   so that we have some pliability and mobility
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.680]   of our spine forward, flexion,
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.320]   so your chin closer to your belly, extension,
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.900]   your chin back and away from your belly,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.040]   sort of arching of the lower back,
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.740]   you can twist a side to side to some extent.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.320]   You have all that stuff,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.620]   and through the middle is the spinal cord and the brain,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.040]   and then you have sensory information
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.840]   going into the spinal cord,
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.640]   from the body, from the muscles, from the skin,
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.640]   and then you have motor commands
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.600]   going out the bottom of the spinal cord,
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.200]   so literally traveling out past those vertebrae and discs,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.040]   out to the muscles to control those muscles
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.520]   for involuntary and voluntary movement.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.240]   If you can understand that,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.460]   and you can envision it just a little bit,
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.140]   even just a little bit,
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.940]   you're going to be able to think about
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.680]   all of the various protocols that we talk about next
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.400]   in the most functional way,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.320]   meaning as you learn about and hopefully incorporate
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.080]   the various protocols for strengthening
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.800]   and pain-proofing your back,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.200]   that you'll occasionally think back to,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.580]   okay, it's my spinal cord
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.980]   that I'm bending in my lower back region.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.400]   I'm allowing the discs to kind of move forward,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.700]   and they likely are kind of bulging out a little bit.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.760]   They're not necessarily herniating, let's hope not,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.360]   but they're bulging a little bit in that direction,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.660]   then back in the other direction,
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.360]   and if you happen to have herniated,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.920]   that is bulging discs, which many people do.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.880]   In fact, I've had that.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.960]   I've got a sort of an L3, a kind of lumbar 3/4 bulge
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.920]   that got activated a few years ago.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.040]   I'll tell you what allowed me
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.280]   to very quickly fix that permanently
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.320]   with no medication, no surgery whatsoever,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.240]   and it was extremely debilitating.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.720]   There's some simple movements that one can do
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.680]   if done in the proper direction and in the proper way
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.800]   that can allow you to push that bulge,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.680]   that herniated disc back under,
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.480]   or I should say closer to the spinal cord.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.540]   Okay, moving it from the kind of bulging out
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.920]   from between the vertebrae
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.320]   to closer again toward the center point of the spine.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.240]   By doing that, one can take pressure off of the nerve roots
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.640]   that are traveling out to the muscles
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.560]   and in from the skin and other sensory information
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.940]   coming into the spinal cord
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.280]   and allow yourself relief from back pain.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.880]   And then by building up stability in the abdominal region,
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.680]   the lower back region, you can create a nice firm core
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.400]   that will allow you to protect all of that
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.280]   with plenty of space so the nerve roots are not impinged.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.180]   And then of course, by focusing on some of the stabilizers
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.840]   that exist really distal,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.640]   which means far from all of that,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.380]   further from all of that, such as the feet,
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.680]   literally how you position your feet,
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.080]   the ability to spread your toes, believe it or not,
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.280]   as a way to provide support for your back,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.580]   not just when doing exercise, but also at rest.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.040]   There are some things you can do about neck positioning,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.300]   strengthening of the front of the neck,
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.720]   strengthening of various muscles.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.340]   Again, that involves no equipment whatsoever
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.100]   that allows you to have a pain-free strong back,
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.480]   both at rest and during movements of different kind,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.000]   different dynamic sport movements
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.660]   like tennis or golf, et cetera,
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.920]   as well as if you're into it, resistance training,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.840]   if you're putting yourself under heavy loads,
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.960]   all of that pain-free and moving through life
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.980]   with a tremendous amount of mobility and versatility.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.200]   Now, before we get into the specific protocols
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   and exercises for strengthening and pain-proofing your back,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.380]   it's worth mentioning something
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.160]   that really was first told to me by Dr. Stuart McGill.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.360]   Again, he's going to be a guest on this podcast.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.360]   Dr. Stuart McGill is a world expert
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.040]   in spine physiology and anatomy,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.740]   and he's worked with a lot of athletes,
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.840]   but his work is not specific to athletes.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.880]   It's really for the everyday person as well.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.200]   And in discussions with Stu,
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.320]   he raises some really important points.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.620]   First of all, if you have back pain,
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.720]   you need a proper assessment and diagnosis.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.520]   It's really impossible for me in this format
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.720]   to try and diagnose your back pain,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.440]   or for you to try and diagnose your back pain.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.680]   That would just be irresponsible of both of us.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.640]   There's just so many things
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.240]   that are specific to each circumstance.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.200]   For instance, some people get back pain
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.960]   or neck pain or both
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.160]   because of overuse of certain motor patterns.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.840]   Maybe they are avid golf players
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.640]   and they're always swinging a certain way
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.560]   with one foot forward.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.600]   That's typically the way it works.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.280]   And they built up some strength in certain pathways,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.880]   both muscular strength and neural strength,
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   but they have a weakness
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.400]   in the opposite side muscles and nerves,
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.000]   and they need to rehabilitate those
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.840]   in order to eliminate the back pain.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.360]   Other people have an injury, right?
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.760]   They have a spinal compression injury.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.080]   They don't just have a herniated disc,
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.380]   they have a ruptured disc.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.880]   Oftentimes ruptured discs need surgery.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.580]   I don't want to give the impression
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.500]   that all back pain can be resolved without surgery.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.220]   There are cases where surgery is necessary, okay?
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.340]   So it's very important that if you have severe back pain
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.780]   or persistent back pain,
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.580]   and you're not able to alleviate it
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.080]   with non-surgical methods,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.800]   that you talk to a back expert, perhaps even a surgeon.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.900]   There are cases for epidurals, for painkillers,
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.860]   for different types of rehabilitative approaches.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.320]   But Dr. Stu McGill has also pointed out
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   that there are a number of things
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.600]   that any and all of us can do
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.080]   by just self-assessing
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.840]   that I think are appropriate for today's discussion
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.940]   that relate to whether or not we are likely
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.540]   to have a thick spine or a thin spine, okay?
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.020]   This isn't a psychological feature,
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.320]   at least not to my knowledge.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.080]   But if you look at different body types,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.100]   you know, what in the old days used to be called
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.440]   the ecto, endo, and mesomorphic body types, okay?
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.700]   This nomenclature isn't used quite as much anymore,
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.960]   but just to kind of return to it,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.340]   the ectomorphic body phenotype
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.500]   is one in which people are typically kind of light boned,
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.020]   meaning thinner wrists, smaller knees, smaller ankles.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.200]   So not really thick bones and thick wrists.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.240]   So that's the ectomorphs.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.080]   These are people that tend to be pretty thin,
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.280]   sometimes referred to as people that have, you know,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.120]   very low body fat, less muscle mass,
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.640]   although that's not always the case.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.960]   Just think lighter, thinner skeleton versus mesomorphs,
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.440]   which tend to be people with kind of thicker wrists,
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.760]   thicker knee joints, kind of thicker overall.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.720]   And then endomorph, which was at the time used to describe
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.400]   people that are carrying more body weight
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.640]   in the form of body fat.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.400]   I don't know how often the endomorph phenotype language
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.520]   is used anymore.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.260]   But what Dr. Stumagill has pointed out
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.960]   is that people in general tend to be more ectomorphic
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.400]   or mesomorphic.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.320]   They tend to be more thick through the torso
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.500]   or thin through the torso.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.820]   They tend to have thinner wrist or smaller wrists
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.240]   as compared to their age matched,
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.840]   sex matched counterparts, okay?
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.900]   But in general, so these are generalizations,
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.640]   people who have thicker wrists
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.040]   generally are going to have thicker spinal segments, okay?
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.460]   In terms of the circumference
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.540]   of the spinal segments and discs.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.120]   Whereas people with smaller wrists, smaller joints,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   smaller ankles are going to have thinner spine.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.760]   So thinner vertebrae, thinner discs between them and so on.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.320]   Now, neither is good or bad.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.400]   They are just different.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.560]   And they create a situation
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.920]   where people have different needs
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.800]   in order to build a strong pain-free spine.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.320]   So for instance, people who have thick spinal segments,
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.000]   so these are people who tend to be more barrel chested,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.080]   thick through the torso,
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.360]   maybe thicker wrists and ankles and knees
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.240]   have thicker spinal segments
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.420]   and therefore may not need quite as much buildup
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.160]   of the musculature around their spine
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.540]   in order to handle vertical loads, okay?
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.180]   Compression along the spinal length
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.080]   because they have those big thick spinal segments and discs.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.140]   It's not to say that they don't need
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.500]   to do any spinal strengthening, they do,
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.500]   but they are generally going to be very stable along the,
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.820]   I'm calling it the vertical axis,
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.520]   but along the length of the spine.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.380]   Those people, perhaps not surprisingly,
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.320]   are not going to be as mobile
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.020]   in terms of the twisting and bending of the spine,
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.340]   meaning spine mobility along the different axes
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.220]   apart from that vertical axis that I was referring to
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.500]   along the length of the spine.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.180]   But twisting and bending is going to be harder for them.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.260]   Now at the opposite extreme,
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.540]   you're going to have people with smaller wrists,
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.380]   smaller ankles, smaller knees,
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.680]   and they in general are going to have a thinner spine,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.780]   meaning vertebrae and discs
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.100]   that are smaller in circumference.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.500]   And they are not going to have the capacity
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.780]   to sustain as much vertical compression
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.220]   along the length of the spine
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.540]   as somebody with thick spinal segments,
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.980]   but they are going to be more "bendy," if you will.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.180]   Now, that doesn't always mean more flexibility.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.940]   What I'm referring to here is a capacity or a potential
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.340]   for the ability to generate movements
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.020]   in which the spine is twisting from side to side
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.860]   with more ease than would be the power lifter.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.840]   So imagine at the extremes,
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.660]   the thick torso and spine of the power lifter,
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.060]   of the shot putter, somebody like that,
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:44.740]   versus the spine of, say, the yoga teacher, the dancer.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.740]   They have these smaller wrists, smaller pelvis,
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.420]   smaller knees, et cetera,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.300]   but they're going to have more ability
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.140]   to twist themselves, their spine.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.060]   So imagine just kind of like bending over to the side
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.460]   a little bit while looking up.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.940]   The spine is going to do that very easily
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.780]   as compared to the person with a thicker torso and spine.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.920]   These two distinctions,
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.380]   and here I'm really making them polarized distinctions,
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.380]   and in reality, there's a whole distribution of thick spine,
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.220]   very thick spine, moderately thick spine, thin spine,
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.300]   ultra thin spine, and so on.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.000]   But at these two extremes,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.780]   you can start to imagine that each of those spines,
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.540]   each of those backs probably has different requirements
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.060]   in order to make it strong and pain-proof
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.340]   depending on the activities
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.260]   that those people are engaged in.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.000]   Now, of course, a thin spine person can decide to power lift.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.100]   That can be very good for them.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.340]   And indeed, one of the things
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.740]   that somebody with a thin spine should do,
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.020]   according to Dr. Stu McGill,
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.680]   and I'll reiterate this several times today,
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.800]   is build up the musculature around the spine
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.900]   so that they can stabilize that otherwise bendy spine
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.300]   along both the vertical and side-to-side axis
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.460]   so they don't injure it.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.000]   They want to make it strong.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.780]   As well as the person with the thick spine
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.340]   who can tolerate heavy loads around one axis,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.860]   but maybe needs to generate more mobility of that spine
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.660]   so that they don't go reaching for a glass
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.500]   up in the cupboard and all of a sudden
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.860]   they have compression of a nerve root coming out the spine
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.420]   because they just twisted it to the side
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.140]   by about five to seven degrees.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.140]   Both groups have specific needs,
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.640]   meaning specific protocols that they can emphasize
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.100]   to a greater or lesser degree
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.620]   in order to strengthen and pain-proof their spine.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.180]   So while we can't do an assessment of spinal pain
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.460]   and your exact needs for your particular body type
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:23.140]   in this kind of format through the tunnel of the internet,
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.180]   you can take a look at yourself
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.260]   or just think about yourself and think,
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.580]   oh, do I tend to have thicker wrists,
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.980]   knees, elbows, et cetera?
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.340]   Am I more of a thick torso person
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.740]   or do I tend to be someone who's more lithe,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.060]   who's more small-wristed?
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.740]   Somebody who can move from side to side with a lot of ease,
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.380]   but probably can't handle as much
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.820]   what I was calling vertical load
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.300]   along the length of the spine.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.260]   And some people have a kind of mixed phenotype,
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.780]   not purely ecto, not purely mesomorphic.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.060]   I can say that about myself.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.580]   I have fairly long limbs.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.900]   In fact, I have like almost a sort of like gibbon arms.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.820]   I have this kind of really long reach.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.700]   So more kind of ectomorphic arms.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.780]   And at the same time, I have a short torso
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.780]   and I am fairly thick through the circumference of my torso.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.780]   I've always been like that.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.140]   Even before I started doing any kind of resistance training,
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.780]   my legs are somewhere in between, okay?
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.620]   So I don't have small knees or small ankles.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.220]   They're kind of moderate in that way.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.100]   My wrists and my arms, probably a bit more ectomorphic,
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.020]   not strong ectomorphic phenotype,
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.460]   but then my torso is a short torso
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.140]   and it's kind of thick through the circumference.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.860]   That's just the way that my genetics
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.900]   landed me into the world.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.140]   You have genetics that landed you into the world
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.280]   in a particular way.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.140]   You can take a look at these kind of external phenotypes
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.660]   about joint size and how to do an assessment,
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.980]   just thinking about it.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.880]   And by doing that, you'll be able to know which protocols,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.160]   which we're about to talk about,
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.620]   you may want to emphasize or de-emphasize
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.560]   in order to best strengthen and pain proof your back.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.420]   So a good analogy that Dr. Stuart McGill offers
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.060]   when thinking about this thin spine
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.780]   versus thick spine thing,
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.180]   is if you think about a willow tree,
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.820]   which has essentially a thin trunk and thin branches
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.760]   relative to say an oak tree or redwood tree,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.640]   the willow tree trunk and branches can bend
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.780]   to quite a considerable degree without breaking.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.100]   So it's just very bendy from side to side,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.620]   but they're thin and they can't sustain
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.500]   a lot of vertical pressure,
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.060]   a lot of loads from top to bottom,
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.100]   or else they'll simply collapse.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.380]   They might not snap to the point of breaking,
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.420]   but they will definitely bend to the point
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.360]   of not being able to bend back.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.900]   As opposed to the trunk and branches
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.760]   of a full grown oak tree or redwood tree,
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.420]   which are very thick and very strong
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.500]   and can sustain a lot of loads from top to bottom
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.620]   along this vertical axis.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.580]   But if they bend even just a tad too far
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.680]   from one side to the next,
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.300]   they're going to snap and essentially break off.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.240]   So while that analogy isn't a perfect one
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.220]   to explain the situation with thin spines
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.540]   versus thick spines,
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.260]   I think it gives you a mental image
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.580]   of the general situation for which some people
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.580]   who have the more willow like spine
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.380]   probably need to build more musculature around the spine
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.940]   in order to stabilize it,
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.380]   but probably don't have to do quite as much work
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.500]   in order to generate more side to side flexibility,
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.780]   as opposed to people who have a thicker spine,
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.220]   who probably don't need to do quite as much work
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.580]   to develop the musculature of the spinal erectors,
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.620]   of the abdominals.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.660]   It's not to say they don't need to develop those at all,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.100]   they do, but that they don't need to do quite as much work
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.800]   to build the musculature around the spine
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.580]   in order to stabilize it for vertical loads,
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.180]   but they perhaps want to do more work
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.380]   aimed at generating more flexibility
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.100]   in these planes of motion from side to side
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.100]   and at different angles, you know,
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.260]   relative to the vertical axis.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.480]   And again, most people don't fall at either extreme
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.620]   of willow like or redwood like,
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.540]   most people are going to fall somewhere in the middle.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.500]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.020]   many of us, including myself,
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.920]   have a sort of combination of more thin musculature
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.140]   and thick musculature,
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.220]   depending where in the body you look.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.400]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.920]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.860]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.540]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.240]   every day since 2012.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.680]   And indeed that's true.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.960]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.320]   once or twice a day
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.120]   because it gives me vitamins and minerals
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.520]   that I might not be getting enough of
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.160]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.080]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.440]   And those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.080]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.000]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.040]   it's often hard to do so,
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.240]   especially when I'm traveling
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.920]   and especially when I'm busy.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.160]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.480]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.460]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.280]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.840]   just report feeling better.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.120]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.400]   because it supports gut health.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.040]   And of course, gut health supports immune system health
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.020]   and brain health.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.140]   And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.640]   and organ processes that all interact with one another.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.400]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.960]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.120]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.480]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.760]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.820]   of your brain and body
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.000]   that relate to mental health and physical health.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.280]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.640]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.080]   to claim a special offer.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.480]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.140]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.320]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.000]   So now let's discuss the protocols
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.600]   that allow you to strengthen your back.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.720]   The first three of these protocols
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.040]   are the so-called McGill's Big Three,
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.280]   named after Dr. Stuart McGill,
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.440]   who again has done a tremendous amount of work
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.820]   in the research and practical realm,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.840]   and has developed a number of different protocols
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.920]   for strengthening and de-painting the spine,
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.400]   but has distilled down three specific protocols
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.820]   that everyone I spoke to in the PT community,
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.460]   in the MD community, for those that specialize on spine,
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.220]   and in the sports community,
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.360]   as well as people who don't play sports,
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.900]   but are simply interested in having a healthy spine
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.460]   for sake of daily mobility,
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.920]   all agree are extremely useful for everybody to carry out.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.420]   Now, the one caveat is that Stuart McGill himself
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.340]   has told me that he doesn't want the Big Three
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.720]   to be viewed as the be-all end-all
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.920]   of back strengthening and pain relief.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.240]   By no means is it exhaustive to do just the Big Three.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.160]   So I'm also going to include a bunch of other protocols
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   that are gleaned from other practitioners,
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.880]   and that Dr. McGill often offers himself in his books,
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.760]   and I'll certainly put links
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.000]   in the show note captions to his books,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.340]   and again, he'll be a guest on this podcast.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.820]   But for sake of clarity and simplicity,
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.160]   the Big Three are as follows.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.880]   The first is called the Curl Up.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.540]   The Curl Up is in many ways a replacement for the Sit Up.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.200]   Most people are familiar with ab crunches and sit ups,
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.780]   where you lie down, typically people will bend their knees,
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.820]   although not always,
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.140]   they'll often put their hands behind their head
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.980]   or on their chest,
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.640]   and then they'll essentially sit up
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.860]   to contract the abdominals.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.380]   Turns out that if you have back pain,
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.780]   and even if you don't,
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.480]   that is probably the least efficient
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.940]   and perhaps even the worst thing
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.320]   that you can do for your back pain.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.660]   And if you think about the discs
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.940]   that sit between those vertebrae,
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.280]   remember those soft tissue discs
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.800]   that allow for some mobility of the spine?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.160]   Well, if you happen to have a disc
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.080]   that's bulging even slightly,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.240]   that is it's herniating,
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.440]   it's getting pushed out from between the vertebrae,
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.000]   and it's impinging on a nerve and there's some pain.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.880]   If you are crunching,
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.560]   you can imagine that's essentially
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.080]   bringing the vertebrae together
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.920]   in the front of that sandwich
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.320]   that is vertebrae, disc, vertebrae.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.660]   And what it's going to do
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.880]   is it's going to have that disc bulge out even further.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.440]   It's going to herniate even further
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.720]   and impinge on those nerves even further.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.040]   So what's required in a situation
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.420]   where you want to strengthen the back
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.300]   or try and eliminate or reduce pain of the back
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.600]   is a way in which you can strengthen the abdominals
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.820]   because the abdominals and the abdominal wall
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.640]   is very important for stabilizing the spine.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.180]   And you want a stable spine.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.620]   That's a very important point.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.040]   But you want to do it in a way
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.920]   where you're not adding to the herniation
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.500]   of the disc in any way.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.600]   So the curl-up is an excellent exercise
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.620]   for people who have back pain
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.500]   and who don't have back pain
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.060]   to strengthen the abdominal wall.
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.520]   And it's done as follows.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.560]   You lie down,
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.580]   you put one knee up,
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.860]   meaning one leg is bent,
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.220]   the other leg is extended.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.500]   You put your hands,
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.320]   both hands below the lower portion of your back.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.740]   So in the arch of your back,
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.960]   and you actually want to maintain the arch of your back.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.260]   That's one of the reasons your hands are there.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.340]   The head is in a neutral position, okay?
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.900]   So your chin isn't tucked toward your chest.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.820]   The chin is in a neutral position.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.940]   And this is important.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.260]   Your tongue is on the roof of your mouth.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.080]   This is something I talked a little bit about
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.220]   in my description of neck exercises in a previous video.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.180]   We're going to get back to this.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.480]   But tongue on the roof of the mouth
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:58.180]   often puts the head into a safe default position.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.980]   It also allows for breathing,
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.980]   in particular nasal breathing to be done very easily.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.200]   So you've got your tongue on the roof of your mouth.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.740]   The mouth is typically closed.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.260]   And then what you do is you raise your elbows off the ground
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.660]   and then while maintaining that small of the back,
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.060]   you're going to just raise your upper chest.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.620]   You're going to lead with the upper chest,
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.180]   not with the chin and head,
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.860]   although of course the head will follow.
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.460]   You're going to raise the upper chest,
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.580]   meaning raise the upper torso.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.780]   So the head's going to move forward
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:31.160]   and you're going to exhale and contract the abdominals
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.500]   for anywhere from eight to 10 seconds, okay?
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.860]   So you get a very strong contraction of the abdominals,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.480]   but you're not doing a full sit up.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.760]   You're only coming up maybe about, I don't know,
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.460]   somewhere between five to 10 degrees.
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.360]   So your back is coming up, the head is coming up,
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.380]   and the chin is not moving towards the chest.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.320]   It's staying in a neutral position.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.880]   You're going to repeat that.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.160]   So meaning you're going to go up,
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.940]   contract for eight to 10 seconds.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.780]   You're going to contract the abdominal walls.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.840]   If you want to exhale,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.620]   you can usually get a stronger contraction
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.620]   of the abdominal walls.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.700]   And then you're going to go back down
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.020]   and relax on the floor.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.220]   Maybe rest 10 to 30 seconds, maybe a minute,
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.980]   and then repeat, okay?
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.300]   So that's the basic movement.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.940]   And then you would switch to the other side,
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.480]   meaning you're then going to extend the leg that was bent.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.620]   You're going to bend the other leg
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.020]   and you're going to repeat.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.820]   In terms of sets and repetitions,
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.420]   typically the best way to do this
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:27.300]   is to do anywhere from three to five sets,
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.780]   starting with 10 second contractions
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.160]   done five times for the first set.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.880]   So it'd be 10 second hold,
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.820]   then relax, 10 second hold,
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.780]   then relax doing that five times, maybe four times,
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.580]   but five would be ideal.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.900]   That would be one set.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.000]   And then on the next set,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.940]   you're going to do four repetitions,
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   meaning four 10 second holds with rest in between.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.820]   And then on the next one, three,
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.060]   on the next one, two,
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.500]   and the next one, one 10 second hold or so.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.900]   These are just rough guidelines.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:00.620]   You certainly don't have to do
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.220]   quite as long holds as those.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.480]   If you can't do those,
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.280]   you don't have to do all of those sets
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.960]   if you find you're fatiguing.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.500]   One of the advantages, however,
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.360]   of doing these brief 10 second holds
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.620]   and really focusing on the contraction of the abdominals
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.720]   hard or as hard as you can,
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.600]   and then releasing is that
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.600]   as opposed to doing a long hold,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.000]   just trying to hold as long as you can
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.720]   and building a lot of endurance in the abdominals,
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.560]   when you repeatedly contract a neuromuscular connection,
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.400]   you build the pathways.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.900]   You basically allow the pathways
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:34.540]   that can engage those strong muscular contractions
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.460]   to a greater degree
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.540]   than if you're trying to just statically hold
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.220]   that particular position for a very, very long time,
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.340]   like 30 seconds or 60 seconds or longer, okay?
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.820]   Now, there are a bunch of different variations
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.660]   of the curl up.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.500]   You can do the curl up
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.960]   with the extended leg elevated slightly to make it harder.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.980]   You can do the curl up
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.780]   with your elbows positioned closer to the ceiling.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.580]   So you're really lifting your elbows
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.780]   and arms far off the ground
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.520]   as opposed to having them just hovering
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.720]   right above the ground.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.760]   There are a bunch of different variations of these.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.320]   We include links to a few short videos
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   in the show note captions
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.800]   so you can see the different variations of the curl up.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:12.760]   Has me doing these on the floor in my typical street clothes
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.720]   so you don't need to get into workout gear to do these.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.760]   And I should mention that the curl up
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.940]   is something that you can do every day
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.960]   if it occurs to you and if you have the time.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.800]   It's something that you would certainly benefit
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.020]   from doing every day,
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.040]   but it's also something that even if you do once
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.420]   or twice a week for even just a couple of sets,
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.820]   you're going to see some benefit
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.260]   in terms of strengthening your back
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.300]   and probably relieving some pain of your back as well.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.620]   The other terrific thing about the curl up
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.740]   is if you have back pain
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.100]   and doing the curl up doesn't aggravate it,
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.500]   you are most certainly doing things
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.780]   to strengthen the musculature around the back
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.100]   that's going to help you avoid more back pain
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.540]   as you work through the different rehabilitative practices
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.400]   that hopefully you're doing with a PT
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.020]   or with a excellent MD who specializes in back pain relief
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.060]   as the pain dissipates,
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.820]   you're going to be building up the musculature
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.740]   of the abdominals
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.100]   that's going to then further protect your spine,
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.900]   especially if you're one of those people
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.740]   that has a thinner spine
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.300]   that needs more muscular support around the spine
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.420]   in order to support it.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.100]   Just as a final note about the curl up,
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.900]   two of the most common errors that people make
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.320]   when doing the curl up
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.660]   is to make it more like a sit up
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:20.020]   and generate a chin to chest movement first
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.060]   and let the chest follow.
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.500]   You really want the chest to lead
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.100]   and keep the head in a neutral position,
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.540]   tongue on the roof of your mouth,
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.020]   try and breathe through your nose.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.960]   And if you find that you can't do the big exhale
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.700]   as you bring it up to the top, don't worry about it.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.260]   It's perfectly fine to hold your breath as you come up
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.420]   and then just maybe release a little bit of air
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.900]   to enhance the intensity of that abdominal contraction.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:45.060]   The second exercise in the McGill Big 3 is the side plank.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.760]   I confess, and I don't know why, I hate doing side planks.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.980]   I don't know why I hate doing side planks.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.580]   I just hate doing side planks,
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.060]   which tells me I should do side planks.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.100]   So I've started doing some side planks recently
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.860]   after talking to Dr. McGill.
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.300]   I'm fortunate that right now I don't have back pain.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.140]   I haven't for a while.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.060]   I'll talk about how I alleviated my back pain,
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.620]   but I spend a lot of time as a 48-year-old
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.620]   thinking about having a strong spine,
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:11.480]   being able to jump off things and land with confidence,
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.000]   all the sorts of things that set one up
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.100]   for both healthspan and lifespan,
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.220]   as has been taught to us by Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.700]   Some of you may know Dr. Peter Attia
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.220]   because he's been a guest on this podcast.
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.620]   He wrote the incredible book "Outlive"
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.700]   and he talks about how having a strong spine,
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.100]   having the ability to break falls
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.780]   by virtue of training your ability to jump down things
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.680]   and step down things with confidence
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.080]   is essential to offset the aging process.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.300]   So I've decided I'm going to do side planks.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.860]   I'm going to embrace the spine strengthening exercises
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.020]   that Stu McGill has put forward as the big three,
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.300]   and that includes side planks.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   So how do you do side planks?
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.940]   Well, most people think that a side plank
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.460]   is just getting on your side, essentially on the floor,
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.660]   then putting one arm down
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.140]   and stacking your feet on the other side
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.880]   and trying to make yourself as stiff as a plank
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.800]   as you possibly can.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.400]   And while that is certainly one way to do it,
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.680]   most people find that they are going to get the most
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.260]   in terms of strengthening their spine
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.620]   and preventing back pain
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.540]   and maybe even alleviating back pain
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.660]   if they build up through a set of incremental steps,
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.120]   making sure that the form on each of the steps
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.620]   is absolutely perfect.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.360]   So the way to really start doing side planks,
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.820]   and if you think you can already do side planks
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.420]   to assess whether or not you're doing them properly,
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.340]   is to start with knees slightly bent.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.580]   So maybe at about a 30 or 40 degree angle.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.660]   So you're on your side, your knees are bent,
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.220]   the feet are stacked.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.940]   You're of course going to push one arm down.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:39.180]   Although many people find that putting their hand in a fist
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.780]   as opposed to a flat hand is going to be best.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.580]   I don't know if most of you are aware of this,
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.740]   but anytime that we generate a fist in either hand,
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.440]   it sets in motion a number of different neural pathways
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.280]   that allow for a firmer contraction of muscles,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.740]   not just within the fist, but elsewhere in the body.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.380]   Okay, if you've ever heard the great teachings
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:01.400]   of Pavel Sutsulin,
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.420]   who I hope to have on this podcast as a guest,
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.020]   he's talked about how if you were say,
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.140]   to try and squeeze a metal bar,
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.780]   or think about just trying to give your friend
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.340]   the firmest handshake you possibly can,
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.540]   you're having that handshake squeeze competition.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.860]   If you make a fist with your other hand,
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.620]   you're actually going to be able to generate
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.100]   a harder contraction of the shaking hand, okay,
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.140]   or the squeezing hand.
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.740]   And this is because of the way that we have
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.460]   these bilaterally wired nerve to muscle connections
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.300]   and the fact that neural activation on one side
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.880]   is related to neural activation on the other side
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.720]   and so forth.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.320]   But basically what you're going to do for the side plank
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.720]   in order to generate the strongest
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.060]   and most efficient side plank for strengthening
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:40.620]   and hopefully deepening your back
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.780]   is to get on the side, bend those knees,
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.380]   put the hand down in a fist position, okay?
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.380]   Then you're going to push the hips off the ground.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.940]   So the upper body is indeed in a plank position.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.380]   Then you're going to raise the hips up
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.000]   and you're going to have to put some considerable effort
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.860]   into pushing the floor away from you.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.020]   That's really the key here,
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.780]   pushing the floor away from you.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.460]   Now, if you find that you can do that
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.140]   and you can hold that position for a good eight to 10 seconds
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.300]   with a strong degree of rigidity,
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.280]   so you're not quaking and you're not feeling
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.420]   as if the hips want to collapse down to the floor,
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.180]   something you really want to avoid,
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:16.480]   especially if you already have some back pain
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.060]   or even a subtle back injury,
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.180]   you want to make sure that your spine is straight, okay?
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.520]   And that those hips come off the ground
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.740]   and you're really in a plank position, right?
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:25.780]   No bend.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.260]   If you find that you can do that
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.180]   and it's fairly straightforward for you,
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.480]   well then feel free to then extend your feet out further,
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.380]   put the top foot on top of the other foot
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.460]   and out to the front, okay?
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:38.620]   So you're not stacking the feet
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.740]   right on top of one another,
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.940]   we're just shoe on top of shoe,
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.740]   but you've got our foot on top of foot.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.440]   If you're doing this barefoot or in socks,
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.380]   but you've got one foot in front of you for some stability
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.100]   and then you're generating that long side plank pose
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.720]   and holding that for eight to 10 seconds,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.020]   then pause for 10, maybe 30 seconds if you have to,
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.520]   and then repeat again, all of that part of one set,
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.860]   just as we talked about for the curl up previously.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.680]   So you're working through the progression from bent legs
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.180]   to straightening your legs.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.960]   If the top foot is placed in front of the other foot
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.140]   with legs straight and that's something that you can do
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.460]   for say anywhere three to five repetitions
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.420]   of those eight to 10 second holds, which make up one set,
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.540]   well then you have the option
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.460]   to make the whole thing more difficult
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.740]   by doing a sort of roll forward
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.100]   where you actually take the part of your shoulders,
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.940]   which is on the side of your free arm,
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.140]   so the hand that is not pressing into the floor
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.140]   and you rotate forward
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.400]   so that your chest is now aiming toward the floor,
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.780]   maybe not to a full pushup position, but maybe close,
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.540]   and then back again to the side plank.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.780]   What you're doing there is you're activating
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.660]   some of the musculature that is for rotation of the spine.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.100]   Okay, and as you do that,
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.340]   you're getting closer and closer to a front plank.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.860]   And of course, front planks are also an excellent way
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.740]   to generate spine stability.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.220]   Most people can do a front plank
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.980]   by resting on their forearms.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.340]   Why start with the side plank?
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.220]   Well, there are a lot of different reasons for that.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.420]   But what you'll realize is that
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:01.540]   when you're doing a side plank,
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.540]   you're actually only really loading
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.300]   half of the spine maximally.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.220]   The other half of the spine is not being loaded maximally
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.180]   'cause it's the side of the spine that's up.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.520]   And of course, that's a reason why you want to do these
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.660]   on both sides of your body, right?
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.220]   So what's the sets and repetition scheme
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:17.280]   that's going to work here?
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.500]   Well, if you're like me and you loathe doing side planks
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.660]   and you find that they do take a lot more effort
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:23.940]   than perhaps you would like,
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.020]   either psychologically or physically,
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.500]   then for me, what I've been doing is
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.260]   one set consists of three 10-second holds.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.780]   I've been doing these with knees bent,
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.180]   although I've now progressed to the point
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.340]   where I can do one foot over the other
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.260]   and resting that top foot across the bottom foot,
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.300]   so legs straight,
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.420]   doing that for three 10-second holds to make up one set,
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.300]   and doing that for two or three sets on one side of my body,
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.280]   two or three sets on the other side of my body.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.780]   So slightly different than as I described for the curl-up,
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.360]   where it was descending repetitions,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.260]   where the first set you're doing five 10-second holds,
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.500]   next one, four 10-second holds, next one, three, two, one.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.220]   For the side planks, I don't like them enough
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.860]   that I just prefer to do two or three sets
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.240]   of three 10-second holds on each side,
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.300]   although I'm starting to enjoy them just enough
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.780]   that I might progress to the kind of
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:13.940]   what's called reverse pyramid,
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.800]   where you go five, five, four, three, two, one,
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.020]   this sort of thing, increasing the number of sets.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.000]   And again, I have a link in the show note captions
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.660]   that shows you how the side planks are done
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.380]   in these different variations.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.500]   I should mention that the most common mistake
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.160]   with side planks is letting the hips sag.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.300]   So if you don't push the floor away from you enough,
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.720]   if you're not stable enough through the foot contact
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.700]   with the floor or the leg contact with the floor,
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.860]   if you're doing these with knees bent,
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.780]   even if you go to like straight
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.540]   and you consider yourself very, very strong
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.340]   in the side plank, if the hips start to sag,
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.780]   you can imagine based on what you now know
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.540]   about back anatomy, right?
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.420]   The spinal cord being this kind of snake-like extension
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.500]   out the back of the brain with the vertebrae as segments
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.660]   and the discs in between them, if that's sagging,
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.740]   well, especially if you have an issue with a disc bulge
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.160]   and some impingement on one of those nerve roots,
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.360]   either coming into or out of the spinal cord,
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.440]   you're going to get into some trouble,
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.740]   meaning it's going to cause some pain
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:12.780]   or at least some aggravation.
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.760]   So the goal is to get that spine really straight
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.520]   as you're doing the side planks,
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:19.200]   regardless of whether or not you're doing that
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.440]   with knees bent or you're doing it with legs straight.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.840]   In fact, that's the reason I went through
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.440]   all of that anatomy earlier,
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.600]   so that as you're doing these exercises,
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.520]   whether or not it's the big three
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.280]   or the other protocols I'll talk about,
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.400]   you can really envision the major components of the spine
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.760]   that are getting engaged, okay?
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.120]   It's not just about the abdominals and the obliques
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.760]   and the lower back, of course, it's about all of that.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.080]   That's what you're exercising,
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.120]   but you're also getting the neural engagement
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.200]   within the spine.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.640]   You should think about the vertebral segments, the discs,
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.820]   the fact that those nerve roots need to run in and out
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.920]   of the spinal cord, out past the bony and disc material,
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.780]   and to do that without impingement.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.200]   So as you do these movements, it can be very beneficial
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.800]   to think about the different anatomical features
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.480]   of the back, including spinal cord, vertebrae, discs,
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.920]   nerves, et cetera, but mainly those.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.320]   And as you're doing that,
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.360]   you'll not just be strengthening your back,
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.280]   you'll also be strengthening your learning
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.840]   of neuroanatomy.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.120]   So the last of Stu McGill's big three, again,
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.160]   Stu kind of cringes every time people say,
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.200]   "Okay, it's just McGill's big three."
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.520]   And that's back strengthening and pain relief.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.200]   And he always just kind of, oh,
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.860]   I can tell it pains him, no pun intended,
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.560]   because he knows, and it's true,
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.760]   that there's a lot more involved in strengthening
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.240]   and pain-proofing the back,
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.560]   but always good to have a great place to start,
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.720]   a simple place to start,
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.960]   and something that's really tractable
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.560]   without equipment or any cost.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.720]   And so we're very grateful that Stu is willing
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.860]   to kind of resist his temptation
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.880]   to be beyond nuanced and thorough, which he always is,
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.520]   and offer us the curl-up, the side plank,
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.240]   which we've covered, and now the third,
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.100]   which is the bird dog.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.680]   The bird dog, as some of you may know,
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.460]   is where you get into all fours on the ground.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.620]   You extend one arm forward,
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.460]   and you extend the opposite one leg backward, okay?
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.820]   So if you're down on all fours
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:11.420]   and you extend your right hand in front of you,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.580]   you're going to extend your left leg behind you.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.160]   Now, there are a couple of key things about this.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.100]   One is, again, have the extended hand in a fist.
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:21.940]   Why?
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.540]   Because you want to generate a strong neural contraction
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.820]   so that you don't forget, and in fact,
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:30.580]   facilitate keeping your upper body parallel to the floor.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:33.940]   So no tilting from side to side, as best you can.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.300]   And you also want the neural activation
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.860]   to allow you to then engage the lift of the leg
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:42.620]   in a way that's also very strong and stable, okay?
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.500]   So nothing floppy, no leaks, as they say.
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.820]   A key point is to make sure
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.820]   you don't raise the leg too high.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.940]   You're not trying to arch your lower back.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:51.860]   In fact, what you want to do
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.140]   is raise the hand in front of you,
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.100]   generate that fist.
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:58.340]   It can even just be out in front of your eyes at first,
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.780]   maybe a little bit higher.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.780]   And then the leg that's extending toward the back,
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.460]   feel free to either point the toe toward the ground,
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.580]   or if you want to extend the toe a little bit,
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.900]   like you're doing a little bit of calf raise in the air,
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.700]   pointing your toe, that is, that's fine too.
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.320]   But don't get that heel up too high
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.820]   or even the upper thigh up too high
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:19.180]   that you're getting a really big arch in the back.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.260]   The idea is to envision one long line
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.380]   between the extended arm and fist
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.820]   all the way back across the midline,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.220]   because it's to the opposite leg
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.700]   and to the foot behind you.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.980]   Again, it's about creating a strong, stable reach,
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:38.460]   a strong, stable lift of the foot, but not too high.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.260]   And this is very important,
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.940]   with the hand that remains planted
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.220]   and the knee that remains planted,
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.060]   pushing the ground away from you.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:49.740]   Okay, that's as important as is the lifting of the arm,
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.300]   the clasping of the fist, and the raising of the leg.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.340]   In all of these movements,
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.580]   the pushing of the ground away from you,
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.980]   the resistance to gravity is as important
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.380]   as whatever movement you happen to be doing.
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.780]   Again, this is a terrific movement
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.380]   for strengthening the spine that most people can do,
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:09.420]   because you're only working one half of the musculature
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.060]   on either side of the spine.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.020]   Okay, there's of course,
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.700]   activation of the musculature on the other side
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.360]   to some degree in order to balance things out.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.160]   But by emphasizing only one half of the musculature,
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.260]   A, you can really focus on the contractions.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.200]   Again, you can really put a lot of mind
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.760]   into the pushing of the floor away.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.920]   You can put your mind into where the fist is
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.940]   and your foot is.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:29.660]   And of course, you can generate
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:30.940]   the kind of hard contractions
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.300]   that are really going to strengthen
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:33.740]   those lower back muscles,
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.020]   as well as the upper back and shoulder muscles
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.260]   that are required for generating stability of the spine.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:40.760]   Again, that's really what this is all about.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.660]   Again, it's going to be maybe three to five repetitions
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:46.020]   of eight to 10 second holds for one set,
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.180]   done for repeated sets,
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.100]   maybe for a descending number of repetitions,
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.740]   where you're going five holds,
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.680]   four holds, three holds, two holds, one hold.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.300]   All of that being done repeatedly
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.780]   and with the greatest amount of intensity and focus
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.380]   so that those nerve pathways
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.260]   can be engaged over and over again very easily,
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.100]   generating a lot of strength of contraction
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.860]   that then of course carries over
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:07.440]   into your exercise activities
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.540]   and even just your passive activities throughout the day,
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:13.100]   and even stability of the spine while at rest,
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.220]   which is something that we're going to talk about more
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.300]   as we get into some of the other protocols.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.980]   Now, of course, with the bird dog exercise,
[00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:21.060]   you also need to train the opposite side of your body.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.580]   So after doing, say, two to five sets
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:28.900]   of those two to five repetitions
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.740]   of eight to 10 second holds on one side,
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.340]   you're going to want to switch to the other side
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.300]   and do the same thing, or you could alternate.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.780]   You could do right hand extended, left leg extended,
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.580]   do one set, then switch to the other side,
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:44.180]   left hand extended, or I should say left fist extended,
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.360]   right leg extended, do those repetitions,
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.020]   call that one set, and then shift back to the other side,
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.220]   and so on and so forth.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.180]   Really depends on how much time you have,
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.480]   how frequently you're doing this throughout the week.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.540]   Again, right now I'm striving to do all of Stumagil's Big 3
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:01.220]   at least once a week, maybe twice a week.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.060]   I know many of you will say, "Oh, that's pretty wimpy.
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:05.780]   "You know, you should be doing this every single day
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.700]   "or five times a week."
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.540]   Well, I have a busy schedule just as many of you do,
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.140]   and it's something that I'm trying
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.400]   to incorporate more and more.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.820]   Typically at the end of a workout,
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.060]   although some people decide to do this
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:16.180]   at the beginning of a workout,
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.120]   right now, fortunately, I'm not dealing with any back pain,
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.400]   knock on wood, but it's something that for many people
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.920]   who have back pain, they find that if they do this
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.000]   at the beginning of a workout,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.920]   it allows them to then move into the workout warmed up
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.640]   and to avoid a lot of the back pain
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.240]   they would otherwise experience.
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.680]   With that said, I want to be very clear
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:38.300]   that if any of these movements exacerbate your back pain,
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.280]   then you should definitely avoid doing them.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.720]   And of course, if you have back pain,
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.800]   you should be working with a licensed professional
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.440]   to figure out how to treat that back pain.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.220]   You may very well need pain meds and or surgery.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.420]   I don't know because I don't know
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.000]   your specific circumstance.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.780]   But for most people who are just trying
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.820]   to strengthen their back, who perhaps are dealing
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.980]   with a little bit of nagging back pain,
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:01.220]   the big three are often very, very accessible,
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.980]   meaning they don't exacerbate back pain.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.960]   And in many cases, they alleviate it,
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.940]   sometimes partially, sometimes completely.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.260]   There are a lot of wonderful anecdotes out there
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.560]   of people who have benefited from doing the big three
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.120]   in all of those categories.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:15.100]   Now, again, we have a link in the show note captions
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.700]   showing how the bird dog exercise is done.
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:18.860]   There are a couple of variations
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.900]   that you can do to make it harder.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.020]   One is to draw boxes with the extended fist
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.640]   and the extended foot.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.660]   That's actually a coordination issue too, for some people.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.900]   So some people choose to do a box with their hand,
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.380]   maybe they do it clockwise,
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.540]   then they do it counterclockwise.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.460]   Some people choose to do the hand and foot
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.360]   moving in a box together, meaning simultaneously.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.780]   Sometimes they'll alternate foot than hand,
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:41.680]   this sort of thing.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.020]   Any kind of movement that you're doing
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:46.580]   with the extended fist and or foot
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.640]   is going to add some degree of difficulty to this,
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.820]   but you want to make sure
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.500]   that if you're going to add those movements,
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:53.380]   those progressions,
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.820]   that you're keeping the pushing away of the floor
[00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:58.220]   constant throughout,
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.360]   and that you're keeping your torso parallel
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.320]   to the floor as you go.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.340]   Now, when I say parallel,
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.020]   I realize that as you do an extension
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.940]   of one fist or the other fist,
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.140]   as you kick out that back leg,
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.100]   it's going to be near impossible for most people
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.180]   to stay perfectly parallel to the floor.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.580]   What you're trying to do, however,
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.980]   is to make sure that you're not rolling
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.620]   from one side to the next.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.340]   You're trying to make sure that you don't get tilted
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:22.740]   onto the stabilizing shoulder hand side, okay?
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.520]   So that's, what's really important.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.540]   You can also, if you really want to make it difficult,
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.480]   you can start to take the extended hand,
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.320]   fist that is,
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.580]   and reach back and then touch the knee
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.920]   that was a few seconds ago extended.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.360]   So you can do that in kind of a kind of reaching back,
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.420]   touching the knee, then re-extending the leg.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.420]   You can do that for one side, both sides, et cetera.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.060]   Again, there are a number of different progressions
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.100]   that I do in the video.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.020]   I must say these are challenging for me,
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.160]   especially doing more than three sets.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.620]   After you've contracted your muscles really hard
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.700]   in the way that you're supposed to
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.760]   for these exercises in the big three,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.240]   you're not going to have the sort of fatigue
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.780]   that you experience after sprinting
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.280]   or after doing heavy deadlifts or something of that sort,
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.740]   but it's a certain kind of fatigue
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:07.140]   that prevents you from performing the movements properly.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.600]   And so the whole point here
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.340]   is to perform the movements properly,
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.160]   to build a pattern, what's sometimes called an engram,
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.240]   but basically it's an activation pattern of nerve to muscle
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.000]   and the resulting limb movements
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.840]   that allow you to do the movements perfectly.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.620]   So don't be in a big rush to do tons of this stuff
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.600]   right out the gate.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.920]   Be in a rush to do as much of it as you can perform properly
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.720]   and consider it a progression
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.520]   and something that you're going to keep up,
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.360]   not just for a week, not just for a year,
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.560]   but it's something that you're going to do
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.000]   for the rest of your life.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.220]   Even if that means doing it just once a week
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:41.180]   or once in a while, learn the movements properly.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.660]   That's the most important thing.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.940]   And of course, I'd be remiss
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.420]   if I didn't mention the common mistakes
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.280]   that people make when they do the bird dog.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.540]   One is people often raise that front fist way too high.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.820]   Okay, as they're reaching for the sky
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.980]   or they're kicking way too high in the back,
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.700]   they're generating a sort of bow shape
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.920]   from extended fist to extended back foot.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.800]   That's not good.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.340]   You really want to raise these things up
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.340]   as stiff, straight levers,
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.620]   while also maintaining as much as you can
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.420]   parallel to the floor stance and pushing the floor away.
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.260]   This is about generating strength of contraction.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.380]   And I know the word sounds bad, but rigidity.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.120]   It's about generating stiffness in the spinal muscles
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.660]   and in the abdominal muscles and in the upper back muscles
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.900]   and the other muscles that are required for this.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.920]   And when I say stiffness,
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.700]   I don't mean a lack of ability for the muscles to move
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.540]   once you're in sport
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.300]   or once you're about your daily activities.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.100]   What I'm talking about is an ability
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.540]   to generate a really firm muscular contraction
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.500]   so that those nerve pathways are strong
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.140]   so that you can stabilize the spine
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.980]   in any number of different dimensions
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.620]   and planes and orientations
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.980]   as you embark on your daily activities,
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.180]   sports activities, et cetera.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.240]   That's what all of this big three stuff is about.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.980]   It's about strengthening the musculature of the abdominals,
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.940]   of the lower back, of the shoulders,
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.980]   and everything that connects it neurally.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.100]   Again, these are pathways.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.820]   It's something that I should have said earlier and didn't,
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.600]   which is we often experience pain in a given location
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.420]   like lower back pain or pain in the lower back
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.060]   and down the hip into the leg.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.260]   But pain is always the consequence
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.900]   of a pathway being irritated or a pathway being activated.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.960]   And in order to strengthen the components around the back,
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.400]   to strengthen the components of the back to avoid pain,
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.860]   you want to work pathways.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.140]   And so the big three that Stu McGill has developed
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.300]   is really about generating the kind of muscular strength
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.140]   and stability, the neuromuscular activation patterns,
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.980]   and doing it in a way that is generally safe
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.620]   for most people to perform
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:41.180]   to get the strongest and most pain-free back possible.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.060]   And what I just described
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.660]   might sound like a lot of exercise.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.700]   It's actually something that if you decide
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.260]   to just include one or two sets of each of those,
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.980]   curl up, side plank, bird dog,
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.140]   you could complete in anywhere from five to 10 minutes.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.420]   Again, if done once a week or twice a week,
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.380]   or as a warmup before weightlifting
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.780]   or at the end of, say, a cardiovascular training session,
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.140]   maybe even while watching TV
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.620]   or listening to a podcast or something of that sort,
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.300]   it actually doesn't take that much time at all.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.100]   And of course, it doesn't require any equipment
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.780]   and it can be done in essentially work or street clothes.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.960]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.540]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Plunge.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.740]   Plunge makes what I believe
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.540]   is the best self-cooling cold water plunge.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:19.620]   Over the last decade,
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.660]   and especially in the last five years,
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:23.940]   there's been an increasing amount of excitement
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.860]   about cold water plunging
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.700]   for sake of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.620]   And that's in large part
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.560]   because one of the most robust effects
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.380]   of cold water exposure are big increases in adrenaline,
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.380]   also called epinephrine, and dopamine.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.140]   So while some people do cold water plunging
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.740]   in pursuit of increasing metabolism or reducing inflammation,
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.340]   it's really those big increases in adrenaline and dopamine
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.380]   that lead to those long-lasting increases
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.400]   in alertness and feelings of wellbeing,
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.120]   not just in the seconds or minutes after the cold plunge,
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.320]   but indeed for several hours afterwards.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.100]   I've been using a plunge for several years now,
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.780]   typically first thing in the morning
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.780]   or after cardiovascular training.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:01.840]   I do agree that doing cold water plunging
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.660]   after a workout designed to generate hypertrophy
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.660]   or strength gains is not a good idea,
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:08.780]   but doing cold plunging at the other times of day
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.740]   can be tremendously beneficial.
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.620]   I use the version of Plunge called the All-In Ice Bath,
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.400]   and Plunge now also makes saunas
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.200]   that get up to 230 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.100]   I love how the Plunge Ice Bath and Sauna
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.800]   can both be controlled from an app on my phone
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.840]   so that if I'm headed home,
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.640]   I can turn on the sauna and it'll be hot when I arrive.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.460]   So if you would like to try a Plunge Ice Bath or sauna,
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:32.260]   you can go to plunge.com/huberman
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.780]   to get $150 off either product.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.980]   Again, that's plunge.com/huberman.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:40.420]   Okay, so before I get into some of the other protocols
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.020]   for strengthening the back,
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.860]   which largely center around building strength
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.660]   into the stabilizing muscles and parts of the body
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.580]   that allow the spine to move
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.900]   through different planes of motion safely,
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.380]   I want to talk about two protocols
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.980]   that one can use to alleviate back pain
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.720]   that many people find beneficial.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.300]   Now, all of this goes back to this thing
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.480]   about vertebrae, disc, vertebrae, right?
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.940]   That's the alternating sequence
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:06.740]   along the length of the spine.
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.140]   And again, the vertebrae are bony tissue,
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.660]   so it's hard stuff.
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.980]   The discs are a softer, right?
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:16.200]   It's got some durability to it, but it's a softer tissue,
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.660]   but it allows for pliability of the spine
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.640]   because it's a soft tissue.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.140]   So imagine an Oreo cookie,
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.920]   something that I'm not a fan of eating.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   I don't like the way they taste,
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.740]   and I'm told they're probably not good for us.
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.420]   But in any case, if you like Oreos or you don't,
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.360]   it's a good analogy here
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.340]   where you've got the two cookies in the cream center.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.820]   So the two cookies are analogous to the vertebrae here,
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:39.460]   and the cream center is analogous to the disc.
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.960]   If you squeeze the cookies evenly from top to bottom,
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.900]   the cream center is going to move out towards all sides
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.060]   along the full circumference, right?
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.500]   So all the white stuff is going to move
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.680]   towards the edges more or less equally.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.880]   If you squeeze just on one side, right,
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.480]   the cream filling is going to move out toward one side.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.500]   If you squeeze on the other side,
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.120]   cream filling will move out toward the other side.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:01.040]   And of course, if you were to crush the cookies
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.120]   from top and bottom,
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.300]   or even just the top cookie or the bottom cookie,
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.280]   the cream filling is going to go up and through.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.200]   That will be equivalent to the rupturing of the disc
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.720]   along that dimension, okay?
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.660]   Why am I mentioning this?
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.600]   Well, as I said before, a lot, not all,
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.620]   but a lot of back pain has to do with compression
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.960]   or impingement of nerves at some point along a pathway,
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.840]   sometimes multiple points along a pathway.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.260]   And one of the most common sources of back pain
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.400]   is when those discs are bulging, they're herniating,
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.340]   and they're impinging on a fascicle of nerves,
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.000]   a bundle of nerves.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.240]   So two of the things that many people find beneficial
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.720]   when they're experiencing back pain are first,
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.740]   if you can find a bar or something that you can hang from,
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.580]   but don't worry,
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.080]   you're not going to have to actually hang
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.600]   in a full dead hang position
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.760]   if you don't have the strength for that,
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.600]   or even if you do,
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.760]   the idea here is to get your arms overhead onto a bar,
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.360]   you're holding onto the bar,
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.800]   and your legs are going to drape down
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.240]   and your toes are going to be in contact with the floor.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.260]   So we're not talking about a dead hang here, okay?
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.920]   Which actually requires that you engage some muscles
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.160]   that can actually aggravate back pain.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.080]   What you're doing here is you're going to hold onto the bar,
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.760]   you're in more or less a hang,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.560]   except that your toes are supporting you or your feet,
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.460]   or sometimes your heels are supporting you.
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.220]   What you're trying to do is get lengthening of the spine.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.300]   Basically what you're doing is the opposite
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:24.020]   of pressing down on those spinal discs.
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:24.940]   And you're going to do that
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.740]   for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.500]   You're not going to twist, okay?
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.900]   You could imagine how twisting of the spine could be bad,
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:33.460]   depending on where the bulge is
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.180]   and which nerves are being impinged.
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:37.760]   What you're trying to do is just create length
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.340]   along the spine to relieve some of that disc bulging,
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.660]   which is impinging on the nerves.
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.940]   Again, without knowing the source of your back pain,
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.900]   it's impossible to know whether or not this will help
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.740]   or it won't,
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.180]   but many people get some degree of pain relief
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.020]   by doing this.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.220]   Of course, you need to be cautious in how you do it.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.080]   You don't want to hang for a long time
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.400]   if you don't have the strength to do that
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.700]   while trying to find the distance to the floor
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.540]   with your toes,
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.740]   you're going to want to progress toward this very carefully.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.260]   But this is something that many people find beneficial.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:07.220]   It's also the kind of logic behind, you know,
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:12.220]   inversion tables and these kind of look more like
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.100]   kind of chair apparati
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.340]   where people have designed chairs that then can invert
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.980]   so that people can relieve some of the pressure
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.100]   on their spine.
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.640]   I've personally never tried those inversion chairs.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.940]   I did use to have an inversion table
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.540]   that I had out on my deck in the morning.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.060]   And I like to, you know,
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.460]   lock my ankles in and invert on that thing.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.280]   It was kind of fun.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.360]   Keep in mind, if you're going to do any kind of inversion,
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.680]   you are going to generate intracranial pressure.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.700]   If you're somebody,
[01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.180]   and I feel obligated to say this
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.460]   because I'm a vision scientist
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.260]   and I worked on glaucoma for a number of years,
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.020]   which is intraocular pressure.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.460]   If you have glaucoma or you're predisposed to glaucoma,
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.700]   you're going to increase ocular pressure
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.940]   if you're inverted in that way or any way.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.980]   So keep that in mind,
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:54.200]   you would want to avoid that in those cases.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.040]   But for many people,
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.700]   just generating some degree of lengthening of the spine
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.400]   by hanging from a bar
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.120]   or from some other physical object that's sturdy
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.980]   while keeping your toes or your feet
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.160]   or your heels in contact with the floor.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.620]   So you're just kind of lightly touching there
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.040]   so that you can keep that going
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.660]   for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:15.420]   and then just kind of relax, let go.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.800]   You walk around a little bit
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.580]   and then repeat doing that two or three times.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.940]   Many people experience some degree of pain relief
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.640]   from doing that for all the reasons
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.020]   that now should be logical and obvious to you
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.260]   based on your understanding of spine anatomy
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:29.220]   and physiology that we talked about earlier.
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:32.060]   And the general theme of just trying to relieve compression
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.060]   that is herniation of the discs.
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.500]   Now, what about reversing herniation of the discs?
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.580]   Okay, so this is something I'm very familiar with.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:39.740]   And I have an anecdote here
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.820]   that of course just relates to my experience.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.020]   So it certainly doesn't carry over to everybody,
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.180]   but it's an experience that I've shared
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.340]   with a number of people who've also experienced
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:51.340]   lower back pain to some degree of success.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.100]   And the story goes as follows.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:56.020]   A few years ago, when I was in Seattle giving a talk,
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.940]   I decided to go to the gym that morning
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.640]   and I did an exercise, which was not a deadlift.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.260]   It wasn't anything spinal really.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.880]   It was kind of a reverse bench dip
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.940]   that I do for my triceps.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.180]   I've always enjoyed doing these.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.900]   I've always been able to do these completely pain-free,
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.340]   but that morning I got ambitious
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:15.260]   and I put a couple plates on my lap in order to do them.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.980]   And I don't know exactly when it happened,
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.220]   but as I was doing these bench dips
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:22.180]   with the weight on my lap,
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:25.740]   something felt like it "went" in my back.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.100]   Something felt off.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.120]   I don't know what happened,
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.940]   but it felt like a little kind of like a little pull
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:31.780]   or something of that sort.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.940]   And when I stood up, I felt okay.
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.780]   And then as I started to walk around a little bit more
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.900]   and went through my workout, I thought,
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.780]   uh-oh, something happened back there.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.380]   This is not good.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.460]   And what essentially was happening
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.300]   is I was experiencing pain on my kind of lower
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.340]   and mid right side of my back down the hip.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:53.020]   So intense pain at the hip socket and down the leg.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.740]   You know what some people might describe as classic sciatica
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.580]   or something similar to that.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.300]   I thought, oh goodness, this is not good.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.980]   And as the morning progressed,
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:03.980]   I was having a harder and harder time, not walking.
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.620]   Walking was okay, but if I sat down
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:09.980]   and then I need to stand up, it was incredibly painful.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.100]   And I thought, oh no, this is it.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.060]   I really did something bad to my back.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.260]   So much so that I was literally bent over
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:18.760]   at about 20 or 30 degrees,
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.860]   walking back to the Space Needle in Seattle,
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.420]   'cause we were giving the talks up in the,
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.220]   one of the rooms there, I don't know if it was the top room,
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.520]   but one of the rooms at the Space Needle,
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.860]   and I could barely walk up to the Space Needle.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.160]   I was just, you know, hunched over.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.660]   It was miserable.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.860]   Now, eventually what happened was I was able to fly home.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.540]   I was in a ton of pain.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.540]   I started reaching out to colleagues of mine
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.240]   that work on the back, that understand pain.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.580]   They were suggesting painkillers.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.460]   I personally like to avoid taking painkillers
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.060]   unless I have to take them.
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:49.320]   And I basically don't take them.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.260]   I might take an aspirin every once in a while,
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.020]   but I really like to avoid taking painkillers.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:53.860]   That's just me.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:55.900]   I don't judge those that need painkillers.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.340]   But basically in talking to medical colleagues,
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.180]   I thought, okay,
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.060]   maybe I'm going to need a corticosterone shot.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.500]   Maybe I'm going to need to just wait it out
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.420]   and keep in mind that a lot of back pain does relieve itself
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.700]   if people just wait it out and avoid the movement
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.220]   or movements that caused or exacerbate that back pain.
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.580]   This is something really important to know.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.700]   A lot of back pain will just relieve over time,
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.940]   but I wanted to stay active.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.500]   So I started reading online, as one does,
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.340]   and I even started doing
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.340]   some abdominal strengthening exercises.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:26.780]   At the time, I wasn't aware of the curl-up,
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:29.660]   and instead what I was doing was some crunches.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:30.940]   So I was doing sit-ups,
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.540]   which, you guessed it,
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:35.420]   made things way, way worse for the obvious reasons.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.460]   It was actually causing more of bulging of the discs
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.900]   that were impinging on those nerves,
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.620]   bulging out the, I guess it would be
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:45.460]   the backside of the back, the posterior side of the back.
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.300]   At the time, I didn't really understand disc anatomy
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.820]   and vertebral anatomy in a way that would tell me
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.460]   that the sit-ups were going to cause that problem,
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:54.300]   but they were making it worse and worse.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.260]   Eventually I crossed paths with a PT who said,
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.140]   "Absolutely stop doing any abdominal crunching.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:02.460]   Just stop, you're making it much, much worse."
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.780]   He explained to me that the discs were bulging
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.500]   at about the L3, L4 region.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.900]   You can look up where that is.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.220]   And then it was impinging on the nerve,
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.020]   which was causing the pain both in the back,
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.100]   at the hip socket, down the leg.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.100]   What did he suggest I do?
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.940]   He suggested that I do essentially the opposite of a sit-up,
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.780]   basically that I lie down on the floor
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:23.300]   with toes extended, legs together,
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.460]   and then do essentially a push-up
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.860]   while keeping my hips in contact with the floor.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.880]   So you might think of this kind of as an up-dog
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.940]   or a Cobra pose in yoga,
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.460]   although not so much extending the head,
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.620]   looking up at the ceiling,
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.340]   but keeping the head in a neutral position,
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.940]   and then doing anywhere from eight to 10 repetitions
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.640]   of those, and then holding the final repetition
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.980]   for as long as I could until I started to quake a little bit
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.220]   and then relaxing onto the floor.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.220]   What was remarkable is that from the very first set
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.300]   of those that I did,
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.780]   I started to experience some degree of pain relief,
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.700]   not total pain relief, but some degree of pain relief.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:58.820]   And what he suggested I do,
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.300]   and what of course I did,
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.240]   was to do those essentially Cobra push-ups,
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.540]   or I don't know really what to call them.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.340]   Again, it's hips in contact with the floor,
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:10.940]   toes pointed back, legs straight, pushing back.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.860]   Essentially what he was having me do
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:14.700]   was to try and work that disc bulge
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:18.660]   back into the more vertical alignment of the spinal column.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.480]   I realize that's not the exact nomenclature,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.600]   so all you PTs and chiros and physios
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.960]   are probably cringing at this point,
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.300]   but for the common listener,
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.140]   what we were trying to do
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:28.220]   was get the cream of the Oreo cookie
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:31.020]   from stopping to squeeze out from the back of,
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.020]   from between those cookies
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.060]   and back under those cookies, so to speak.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:38.340]   And what I found, and this was just remarkable,
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:41.520]   was that within two, maybe three days,
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.740]   the pain was almost completely gone,
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:44.600]   almost completely gone,
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.300]   which was to me just staggering.
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.100]   No pain medication.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.460]   I mean, prior to this, I was thinking,
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.620]   oh goodness, I'm going to need corticosterone injection.
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.840]   I'm going to have to take pain meds.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.180]   I might even need surgery.
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.800]   I mean, I was completely debilitated.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.840]   Now, of course, we don't have the control experiment
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.300]   where I didn't do these exercises and I did nothing.
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.280]   So we don't know how fast it would have relieved itself
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.400]   had I just done nothing.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.420]   So that's an important caveat to all of this.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.360]   And again, this is just my experience.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.440]   But the reason I'm sharing this experience
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.240]   is not because I necessarily think
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.280]   that you should be doing these same exercises
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.860]   to relieve a disc bulge and the pain that results from it,
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.720]   but to give you a sense of how the disc bulging
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.320]   and the impingement on the nerve
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.680]   is very often the cause of back pain
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.940]   and you want to absolutely avoid doing anything
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.880]   that exacerbates that disc bulge.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.000]   So in my case, it meant avoiding doing any crunching
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.100]   because that would send the cream
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.320]   from between the two Oreo cookies further and further out,
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.120]   impinging on the nerve more and more and more,
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.840]   creating more and more pain,
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.880]   rather to try and push things back
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.560]   by doing a spinal extension,
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.560]   by creating an arch in the lower back,
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:48.200]   by doing these essentially Cobra pushups from the floor.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.200]   And when talking with this PT again and telling him,
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.660]   gosh, the back pain is essentially removed.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.500]   This is amazing.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:58.160]   Back to exercising, walking, running in the very same week.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.080]   He said, yes, indeed, some people have so much back pain
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.120]   that they can't even do the Cobra type pushup.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.560]   They need to just go to a wall
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.680]   and actually just put their hands on the wall,
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.240]   standing about six inches or so away from the wall,
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.800]   and then just push their hips towards the wall.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.920]   Okay, yeah, I acknowledge it kind of an odd visual there,
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.520]   but pushing their hips towards the wall
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.640]   while keeping their arms bent and their torso
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.400]   anywhere from six to 12 inches from the wall.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.180]   And then eventually progressing to being able
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:27.900]   to do these Cobra type pushups or up dogs,
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.200]   whatever you want to call them, on the floor.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.540]   I, again, will provide a link in the show note captions
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.100]   of how these are done.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.420]   I found these to be tremendously beneficial,
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.740]   not just when I have back pain, because yes,
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.340]   indeed, a couple of years later,
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.660]   I did something else in the gym.
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.100]   I wasn't training particularly heavy.
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:46.540]   And that same L3, L4 thing started again.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.100]   And I started doing these right away
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.660]   and it resolved it right away.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.200]   Okay, so clearly it works for me.
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.980]   But one of the things that's really been key for me
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.100]   is to understand that I have a propensity for a disc bulge,
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.100]   a herniation in that region.
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:02.260]   I now know what direction the disc bulge goes,
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.700]   therefore, which exercises to avoid
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.220]   because they exacerbate that herniation of the discs,
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.500]   and which exercises to emphasize
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.420]   because they help alleviate the herniation of that disc.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.760]   And this is why a little bit later,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.680]   I'm going to talk about some of the protocols
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.660]   that you can incorporate into your resistance training,
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.820]   things like posterior chain work,
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.760]   like glute ham raises, Nordic curls,
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.660]   and things of that sort.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.860]   That if you're like me,
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.260]   and you're prone to slight herniation of the discs
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.140]   in the direction towards the posterior side, right?
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.600]   That it's very important to build up the musculature
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.300]   that surrounds those discs
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.860]   so that one can avoid herniating them further.
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.700]   So again, this is my experience.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.340]   You, if you have back pain, I would hope not,
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.520]   but if you have back pain,
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.720]   it might be a herniation
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.700]   toward the anterior side of your spine, right?
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:51.340]   It might be herniation in the direction of spine flexion.
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.420]   And so therefore you need to do different exercises.
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.640]   The point is that you need to understand
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.620]   what the origin of the pain is,
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.340]   but I also offer this story
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.740]   because I've known several people,
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:02.580]   one of whom is in my family,
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.340]   who experienced back pain,
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.220]   thought they need to get corticosterone injections,
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.260]   actually got those injections,
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.640]   got some degree of pain relief, which is not surprising,
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.460]   but then the pain came back.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.060]   Okay, it turns out they had a herniated disc
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:19.940]   in the same kind of area and general category of posterior,
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.500]   you know, the cream of the cookie going out the back,
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.060]   all right, or towards the back as I did,
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.760]   thought that my anecdote about the herniated disc
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:30.740]   and these, you know, pushups and these wall pushups
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.220]   and pushing one's pelvis towards the wall was kind of goofy
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:35.560]   and, you know, wasn't really medical,
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.980]   but was very interesting,
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:40.040]   is when they then traveled to Europe,
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.260]   to Scandinavia for the summer, living there,
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:46.060]   they're Scandinavian, and spoke to a physician there,
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.660]   the instruction from that MD,
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.860]   that physician was not to do corticosterone injections
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:53.100]   or to get surgery, but you guessed it,
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.200]   to do exactly the same exercises
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.520]   that the PT in the United States suggested to me.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:19:59.740]   Now, why do I raise this?
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.300]   Well, the last thing I want to do
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.980]   is get into a debate online
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.380]   about whether or not one profession like PT or Cairo or MD,
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:07.740]   et cetera, is better than the other.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.980]   I realized there's a range of talents.
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:12.620]   There are mediocre, terrible, bad,
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:14.640]   excellent, and superb practitioners
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.820]   in all these categories, by the way.
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:19.980]   That's clear to me and hopefully to everybody else, right?
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.780]   You can't look at an entire field and say good
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.060]   or entire field and say bad.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.300]   There's going to be a range of quality of practitioners
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.780]   in any of those fields.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.140]   But when it comes to back pain,
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.540]   we are at an interesting point in history
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.660]   where depending on where you are in the world,
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:35.940]   depending on the traditions of the medical practice
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.900]   in the area in which you live,
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.460]   certain forms of relieving back pain
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.300]   are going to be looked at as more esoteric than others.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.740]   So that's the other reason I offer this anecdote.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.820]   This family member of mine and a couple of friends
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.980]   who've experienced back pain of a similar nature
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.020]   have all now incorporated these Cobra pushups,
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:57.980]   up dog type approaches to some degree of success or another.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.260]   It is true that one of them had a badly enough
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.460]   herniated disc that they did need surgery.
[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:04.940]   So surgery sometimes is needed, of course,
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.340]   but it's been remarkable to me
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:09.620]   to see how much I and others can relieve their back pain
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:13.420]   and strengthen the particular areas and aspects of the body
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.380]   that then can avoid further back pain.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:16.460]   And I'm quite happy to say
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.620]   that I've had essentially zero back pain
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.700]   now that I've incorporated
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.620]   the right rehabilitative exercises,
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.020]   as well as the right strengthening exercises,
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.540]   which include the big three that we talked about before
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.460]   and the ones I'm going to talk about next.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.140]   I realized that when a lot of people hear about back pain,
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.260]   they immediately think of sciatica.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:35.640]   And as somebody who's always carried his wallet
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.100]   in his back right pocket, I'm often told,
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.460]   "Hey, you're going to get sciatica
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.860]   if you carry your wallet in your back right pocket."
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.700]   Well, I always take my wallet
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.900]   and put it in my front right pocket when I sit down,
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.740]   or at least I try to remember to.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.420]   So I don't think that's the cause.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.780]   I'm certainly somebody who's had quote unquote sciatica.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:56.060]   Now, sciatica is most commonly thought of
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.180]   as tingling pain or numbness
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.100]   or some combination of the three
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.140]   in maybe a little bit in the lower back,
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.140]   in the glute region, in the hip and down the leg,
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.500]   especially.
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.580]   Now, relieving sciatica
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.240]   involves a number of different approaches,
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.840]   and I'll probably have to do an entire episode
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:15.380]   about sciatica and other nerve pathway pain specifically.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:16.220]   But for the time being,
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:19.460]   a lot of sciatica is caused by exactly the sorts of things
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.980]   that we were talking about thus far,
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.100]   the herniation of the disc,
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.580]   the bulging of the disc and the impingement on the nerve.
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.140]   And when that bulging, aka herniation,
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:31.240]   is occurring within the lower lumbar region of the spine,
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.040]   oftentimes it will impinge on a nerve or nerves
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.340]   that innervate the various regions I just described.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:38.340]   So the glutes, the hip, down the leg,
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.180]   and sometimes will activate pain,
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:42.980]   tingling or numbness in areas
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:45.600]   which are not innervated by that nerve.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.100]   There's something called referred pain
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.700]   where you're experiencing pain in one part of the body
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:52.420]   due to an impingement or disruption of a neural pathway
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.500]   or other pathway or inflammation elsewhere in the body.
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.460]   So we're not going to do a deep dive on sciatica right now.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:02.100]   Suffice to say that a lot of the symptoms of sciatica
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.240]   fall under the umbrella of what we're talking about today,
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.200]   which is back pain and strengthening the back in a way
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.600]   that can help you avoid back pain
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.120]   and indeed sciatica as well.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.520]   Much of what I just spoke about
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.080]   in terms of my own experience with lower back pain
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.400]   could be thought of as sciatica
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.020]   'cause there was a lot of pain in the hip.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.440]   I almost felt as if the hip socket was in pain.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.400]   And there was some pain, not shooting down the leg,
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.760]   but kind of in the outer uppermost thigh for me.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.640]   Some people experience it all the way down to their toes,
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.360]   even numbness, tingling, or pain within the foot.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.740]   So it really depends on the degree
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.340]   to which those neural pathways are impinged.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.060]   But the principles are the same, which are,
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:41.500]   if you are experiencing lower back or related pain
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:45.060]   in the hip, the leg, the buttocks, et cetera,
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.660]   you really want to figure out,
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.540]   is there a bulging, also called a herniated disc?
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:53.220]   If so, which direction is the herniation likely occurring?
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:54.380]   Is it out toward the back of the spine?
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.740]   Is it on one side?
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:58.380]   You really want to understand where that herniation
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:23:59.640]   and bulging is occurring
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.180]   so that you can do the proper exercises
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.600]   to work that bulging,
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.940]   to push essentially what I'm referring to an analogy
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.680]   as the pushing back of the cream
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.940]   between the two Oreo cookies,
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.620]   back between those two Oreo cookies
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.560]   so that you can give some relief
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.940]   from the impingement on those nerve roots
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:18.260]   that are no doubt causing the flare up of back pain
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.940]   or what some people experience and call sciatica.
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.740]   Okay, so thus far, we've largely been talking
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:25.100]   about different structural features of the back,
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:28.580]   things like vertebrae, which are bony, the discs, et cetera,
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:30.660]   that can impinge on nerves and cause pain.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:33.320]   And while pain is certainly neural,
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.260]   there are a number of things that exist
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:39.900]   from literally toe to head that allow our back
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.380]   to move through the various planes of motion
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.700]   in the ways it needs to,
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.860]   to carry out daily living, to carry out sport,
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:48.140]   and that if we strengthen certain things,
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:51.620]   even very distal, very far from the spine,
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.900]   we can allow for more mobility of the spine,
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:55.000]   strengthening the spine,
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.900]   and indeed even pain relief within the spinal pathways.
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.440]   Now, the protocols we're about to discuss
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.080]   were shared with me with Dr. Shawn Wheeler.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.340]   Shawn Wheeler is a medical doctor
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:08.860]   who has an incredible knowledge of back pain,
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.820]   back relief, and back strengthening.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:14.000]   By no means can I exhaustively cover
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.400]   all of the knowledge that he shared with the world.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.520]   I'll provide links to some of his work
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.460]   in the show note captions.
[01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:22.160]   I intend to bring him onto the podcast as a guest,
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.540]   but the hallmark of the protocols
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:26.140]   I'm about to share with you is the following.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:31.140]   We have muscles that are constantly actively engaged
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.260]   in order to stabilize our spine,
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:34.380]   which again, is a good thing.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.980]   You want a stable spine.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.880]   And we have muscles that are not actively engaged,
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.760]   but for which we can engage them either voluntarily,
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.260]   or we can train them to be more engaged
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.620]   when we're not thinking about it.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:47.900]   So involuntary engagement.
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:50.180]   But we have an entire set of musculature
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.660]   that is constantly actively engaged
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:54.660]   in order to stabilize our spine,
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.500]   which again, is a good thing.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.460]   And we have musculature
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.460]   that can potentially stabilize our spine
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:02.620]   if we focus on it, if we consciously decide to.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:05.100]   So what I'm about to describe are some simple protocols.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.600]   In fact, very simple protocols that you can do
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.900]   in order to create more spine stability.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.820]   And in fact, you can do these anywhere.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.620]   The first involves strengthening the muscles
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.200]   in the front of the neck.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.780]   Now, this is something that I do believe
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:19.060]   most everybody should be doing anyway.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:19.900]   Why?
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.380]   Well, most people nowadays are starting to take on
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:25.300]   a C shape, not just rounding of the lower spine,
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:28.320]   but the chin is starting to move toward the chest.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.140]   And of course, this is because most everybody is texting
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.380]   or on a laptop much of the time.
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.420]   Okay, this is not an exaggeration.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.300]   If you look at people walking around now,
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.100]   they are tilted forward at the chin.
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.060]   They are essentially taking an inch or two off their height.
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:46.260]   They are potentially creating pain elsewhere in the body,
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.020]   maybe even in the neck itself.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.060]   And what I'm about to describe is a way in which
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.180]   you can very easily strengthen the muscles
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.080]   in the front of the neck without adding size to the neck,
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.440]   because I know a lot of people don't wanna add size
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.280]   to their neck.
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.260]   I've talked elsewhere about strengthening the muscles
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.360]   on the side of the neck and in the back of the neck.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.060]   This is something that I do believe is important,
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.540]   especially for people that are doing a lot
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.140]   of heavy weightlifting, who are broadening their shoulders
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.340]   or who already have broad shoulders.
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:12.980]   Also just from a sheer aesthetic perspective,
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.900]   nothing looks weirder than a little head and neck
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:16.860]   placed on broad shoulders, okay?
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.900]   But more importantly than any aesthetic matters
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.800]   is that if the musculature of the neck is weak,
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.580]   you have a weak upper spine,
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:26.100]   which is not a good thing from the perspective
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:28.240]   of avoiding pain and not a good thing
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.340]   from the perspective of safety,
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:32.060]   let alone posture, breathing, et cetera.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.140]   I've talked about that elsewhere.
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.700]   I'll provide a link in the show note captions
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:37.780]   to some of the simpler exercises for strengthening the neck
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:39.240]   that you can do without equipment.
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.140]   In the meantime, for sake of strengthening
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.460]   and pain-proofing the back,
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.520]   it's very clear that strengthening the muscles
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.700]   of the front of the neck can be very beneficial.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.380]   This is something that not just Dr. Wheeler,
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:53.740]   but also Stuart McGill have been proponents of.
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:56.020]   And the simplest way to do this without any equipment
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:59.260]   is to simply put your fists underneath your,
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:01.460]   not your chin, but on the two sides of your jaw.
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.320]   So on either side of your chin, if you're just listening,
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.820]   that's why my voice is going like this.
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.100]   And then with your tongue on the roof of your mouth
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:09.460]   and breathing through your nose,
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.300]   you're just going to do a 10 second static contraction
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.260]   where you're going to try and move your chin down
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:16.580]   against the resistance of your fists
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.540]   underneath your jaw, okay?
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.760]   So you're going to go push down there.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.460]   Again, tongue on the roof of your mouth.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.220]   Feel free to exhale as you do this.
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.820]   You might want to do this for three or four repetitions
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:32.300]   of 10 second static contractions, and then just relax.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.020]   You could do that for anywhere from two to five sets.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.300]   Very easy to do.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:38.000]   What you're doing is you're generating strength
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.900]   in the muscles of the front of the neck
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.220]   and some nearby musculature.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:46.100]   It has the tendency to then put you into a default position
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.140]   at a distance from your chest, okay?
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.900]   So this is different than strengthening the muscles
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:51.780]   on the back of your neck,
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:54.420]   which will of course help to keep your chin out
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.080]   and away from your chest.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.460]   But when one does this,
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:59.140]   there are a number of different benefits,
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.640]   improved airway passage.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.040]   So as many of you know,
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.540]   I'm a big proponent of nasal breathing,
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.380]   unless you need to breathe through your mouth,
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.200]   both during sleep and sometimes during exercise,
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.420]   but certainly at rest.
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:12.620]   So strengthening the muscles of the front of the neck.
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:14.620]   Again, I'll provide a link to this in the show note caption.
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.500]   It's very easy to do.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.660]   It takes barely any time.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:18.180]   You can do it anywhere.
[01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:19.820]   And it has a number of different benefits
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:23.140]   for strengthening and pain proofing the spine.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:28.060]   Next is to focus on strength of your feet and your toes.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.380]   Yes, you heard me correctly.
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:31.060]   Why are we talking about feet and toes
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.700]   when we're talking about back strengthening
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:34.940]   and alleviating back pain?
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.980]   Well, your feet are the foundation of your entire body.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.360]   They're carrying you around all day long.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.100]   And it's very clear that the stronger your feet are,
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.100]   the healthier the rest of your body is going to be.
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:48.020]   It's not to say that the rest of your body will be healthy
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:49.540]   if you just focus on foot strength.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.600]   That's certainly not the case,
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.160]   but strengthening your feet has many, many benefits.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.940]   It's something that I've been focusing a lot on
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:57.140]   in the last couple of years.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.840]   And it's made a huge difference
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:02.060]   in terms of eliminating shin splints when I run.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.580]   It's made a huge difference in terms of alleviating
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:06.180]   a certain amount of lower back pain.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:09.120]   Although you heard the anecdote about how I largely did that
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.980]   through other mechanisms earlier.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:13.620]   Basically strengthening your feet
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.640]   is an all around terrific thing to do.
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:16.480]   How do you do this?
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.780]   Well, some people opt to get very wide toe box shoes.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.980]   Some people will even run in those shoes
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:25.340]   where the individual toes look like they're in a glove.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:26.300]   I don't own those shoes.
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:28.500]   I do have a slightly wider toe box shoe for running
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.140]   and I've really benefited from that.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:32.980]   But basically what anyone can do
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:34.500]   and you don't need to purchase any shoes
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.620]   or anything like that is to try and see
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.500]   if you can spread your toes out from one another
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.740]   so that none of them are touching on both feet.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:45.420]   Many people find that they are able to do that.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.320]   Some people, including myself, found that they could do that
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.640]   on one foot, not the other.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:52.280]   And it just took a couple of weeks of working at it
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.580]   and strengthening those neural pathways,
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:56.360]   learning how to activate those neural pathways
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.280]   through concentration to be able to spread my toes
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.440]   on both feet.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.900]   This might sound a little silly to some of you,
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:04.220]   but being able to spread your toes on both feet
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:06.320]   actually says a lot about your ability
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.520]   to activate distal neural pathways,
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:09.880]   or I should say neural pathways
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.760]   to distal parts of your body.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.000]   There's a bunch of interesting data
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.840]   about how that correlates with some metrics of aging
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:17.680]   or lack of aging.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.040]   I'm going to cover that in a future podcast.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.800]   But some people find that they can't spread their toes out
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.600]   and they need a little bit of help from toe spreaders.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.200]   Yes, there are commercially available toe spreaders
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.920]   that take the form of these kind of stocks
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.680]   that you can put between your toes.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.760]   These are rubber stocks that then spread the toes.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.660]   It can be a little bit uncomfortable at first,
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.200]   but then you get better at it,
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.640]   help you learn to spread your toes.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.800]   You certainly don't need those things.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.200]   You could even just take some paper towel or tissue paper
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.840]   or something that's firm and put it between your toes,
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.940]   and that will help you learn to spread your toes.
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.560]   I'm not suggesting you walk around all day
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:55.380]   with toe spreaders,
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.000]   although some people actually do that.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.820]   But basically what you're doing
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:59.320]   is you're creating the ability
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.640]   to activate the neural pathways
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.520]   that allow you, excuse me, to spread your toes.
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:04.800]   I know this might sound silly,
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.640]   but if you do this,
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.520]   you're going to find that you're walking,
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.880]   your stance when you're stationary,
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.560]   and certainly if you do any kind of running or cycling,
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.140]   you're going to find that all of those things
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:15.380]   are going to benefit.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.160]   In addition, there is benefit to strengthening your toes.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.640]   This is something that I'm only now starting to explore.
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.740]   One way you can do this is by sitting in a chair barefoot,
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.480]   spreading your toes as much as possible,
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.320]   and then seeing whether or not
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.720]   you can lift each toe independently.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.260]   I'm not at the point where I can do that yet.
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:35.060]   I'm still trying to learn how to lift my big toes
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:36.400]   independent of my other toes.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.640]   Again, all of this is learning
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.420]   how to activate neural pathways
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.320]   to distal parts of your body
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:45.960]   that serve as stabilizers for the arch of the foot,
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.960]   for the foot itself, for the ankle, for the shin,
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:53.360]   that carry over to spine stability and a strong spine.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.160]   I know it seems kind of wild
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.960]   that we're talking about the feet and toe spreading
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.240]   to benefit your back,
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.880]   but all of these things relate to one another up and down,
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.820]   the chain of activation involved in walking, in running,
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.580]   and certainly if you're involved in any other sports,
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.300]   but also just standing around.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.320]   So don't underestimate the power
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.520]   of learning to spread your toes
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.160]   and learning to move your toes independently.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.000]   And then of course,
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.040]   there's a whole set of exercises that you can find online
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.040]   of how to actually strengthen the individual toes
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.720]   with bands and things of that sort, pretty advanced stuff.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.680]   Most people aren't going to do that,
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.720]   but if you're willing to explore that stuff,
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:25.360]   it's clear that there are a lot of benefits.
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.160]   And again, there's some exciting literature
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.980]   starting to emerge about the benefits of toe strengthening
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:33.600]   and toe spreading and all that stuff
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.320]   as it relates to, believe it or not,
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:37.740]   neurocognitive longevity.
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:38.640]   I know it sounds wild,
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.960]   but this is actually a literature
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.660]   that's starting to pick up some weight.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:43.800]   So it's one that I'm paying attention to
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.640]   and that I'm certainly going to cover in a future podcast.
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.480]   Okay, so we've got strengthening the neck.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.800]   We've got toe spreading at a minimum,
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.460]   making sure that you can spread all your toes,
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.700]   move them independently.
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.920]   That would be great.
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:55.760]   What's that going to do?
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.240]   That means that when you're standing at rest,
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.320]   that you're creating a stable base for yourself
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.840]   when you're walking, when you're running,
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.920]   and certainly when you're lifting
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.440]   or you're playing any sports,
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.840]   you're creating the most stable base for yourself possible.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:08.860]   When I say stable base,
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:10.440]   I don't just mean because the toes are spread.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.860]   I mean, because if you can activate the musculature
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:14.720]   to spread those toes,
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.520]   or if they're passively in that spread toe position,
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.840]   not touching one another,
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.240]   you're going to be activating some of the musculature
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.640]   that's, I guess, for the typical person
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.040]   we would think of this as in the arch of the foot,
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.360]   in the top of the foot,
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.160]   and running up to the front of the shin,
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.960]   that's going to create the most stability
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.120]   for your lower limbs, your upper limbs,
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.680]   your pelvis, and your spine, okay?
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.440]   Now, in discussions with Dr. Wheeler
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.180]   and discussions with Dr. Starrett
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:41.480]   and discussions with Dr. Stu McGill,
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.120]   all of them really emphasize
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.960]   that when doing resistance training,
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.960]   that bracing the body
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.460]   by essentially not doing a big belly breath,
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.120]   but filling the body with air
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.120]   so that you essentially create a firmness
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.280]   within the abdominal walls
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:57.120]   and the spinal erectors and the obliques,
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.200]   so this would be essential in a squat-type movement
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.640]   or other types of movements,
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.780]   that's beneficial during resistance exercise
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.160]   to create the most stable canister of you,
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.880]   the most stable activation of the musculature
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.880]   around the spine to avoid injury
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.680]   and also to lift the greatest amount of weight.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:15.120]   There's a number of different mechanical advantages
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.400]   and safety advantages that are afforded when we do that.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.520]   This was also something that I discussed
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.880]   with Dr. Andy Galpin when he did his series
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:24.160]   on exercise physiology with us.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.520]   Again, we find a link to that in the show note captions.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.160]   Now, that bracing, that filling of the body with air
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.480]   and that bracing of the abdominals and the musculature,
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.960]   essentially that runs like a belt around the midsection
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.400]   to make yourself strong and stable during those movements,
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.040]   that's all fine and good,
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.400]   but it turns out that when we're at rest,
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.760]   when we're just standing around,
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.240]   we actually want to do the opposite.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.880]   We actually want to relax that musculature
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.480]   and belly breathe.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.500]   Now, I've done an entire episode about breathing
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.040]   and the difference between belly breathing
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.280]   versus breathing where the chest lifts
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.560]   or a combination of both,
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.800]   but we can keep this very simple.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.560]   You can do yourself a great favor
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.920]   by trying to remember that when you're at rest,
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:02.980]   you're just standing around,
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.180]   maybe you're seated or standing and working
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.000]   or you're talking or something of that sort
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.720]   that you're ideally nasal breathing
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:11.200]   unless you're speaking or eating or something of that sort
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.880]   and you are belly breathing, okay?
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.120]   So you're actually relaxing the abdominals as you inhale
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.480]   and the belly is moving out
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.780]   and then as you exhale, the belly moves in.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.920]   So that's the ideal pattern when at rest,
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.040]   the exact opposite of the pattern that you want
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.280]   when you're actively engaging all that musculature
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.040]   for sake of exercise and stability,
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.560]   especially when you're engaging
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.460]   in weight training under loads.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.980]   So that places us at strength in the front of the neck,
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.900]   toe spreading and strengthening of the feet,
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:40.020]   belly breathing at rest.
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.040]   And then there's a kind of fun one
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.280]   that's something that I've been incorporating a lot
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:47.140]   because frankly, I'm not a big fan of doing abdominal work.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:49.180]   It's just not something that I really enjoy doing
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.280]   in the gym or elsewhere,
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.700]   but I know that it's important
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.340]   to have a strong abdominal wall.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:56.940]   It's important to have strong abdominals generally.
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:59.460]   And yes, occasionally I'll grab onto a bar
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.860]   and I'll do a set of pikes.
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:02.060]   I actually enjoy pikes, you know,
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.380]   bring my ankles up to my hands and doing that,
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:06.340]   trying to stop there, doing L-sits, things like that.
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.100]   I'll do those every once in a while,
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.300]   but what I found to be very beneficial
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:14.100]   and that is more kind of real world related
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:16.220]   in the sense that it activates the musculature
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:17.280]   of the abdominals.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.460]   You can train your abdominals while doing things
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:22.900]   that more closely mimic what you do in real life
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:25.400]   is to actually stagger one's stance
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.660]   while doing certain forms of resistance training.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.620]   Okay, so not during deadlifts,
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.020]   not during squats or anything of that sort,
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.180]   but let's say during dumbbell curls for the biceps,
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.620]   rather than stand with feet parallel,
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.780]   standing with one foot in front of the other,
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:42.860]   making sure that they are wide enough apart
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.100]   in the lateral plane, as we'll call it.
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:46.680]   Okay, so far enough away on either side
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.140]   of your belly button so that you're stable,
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:49.340]   little bend in the knees.
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:51.580]   And then making sure that your belly button
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.300]   is still facing directly forward.
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.180]   This is really key, not twisting the torso,
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.340]   but making sure that your belly button
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.820]   is facing directly forward and doing curls,
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:03.020]   one arm, then the other arm, one arm, then the other arm,
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.500]   then switching to a stance in which the other foot
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.060]   goes forward and the other foot goes back.
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:09.780]   Again, make sure that you're not
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:11.500]   in a cross-country skier position
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.580]   with the feet very close to your midline,
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:16.260]   because if they are, you're not going to be stable.
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:17.860]   So make sure that they're far enough away
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.420]   from your belly button on either side,
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:21.340]   that there's a bend in your knees so that you're stable,
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:23.340]   and then doing curls that way.
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:25.860]   Could also do this for any kind of triceps exercise,
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.920]   like an overhead triceps extension.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.580]   Those are mainly the exercises
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:31.100]   in which one could apply this,
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.460]   although there are a few others,
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.640]   maybe for back work, maybe for shoulder work,
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.300]   although I think parallel stance is probably best for that,
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:38.940]   and certainly for leg work.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.420]   So what are you doing if you do curls
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:42.700]   or overhead triceps extension in this way
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:45.080]   with one foot forward, then the other foot forward?
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:45.920]   What are you doing?
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.560]   Well, if you deliberately insist,
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.340]   meaning force yourself to keep your belly button
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:53.100]   facing exactly forward, and for that reason,
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.340]   sometimes it's helpful to do these in front of a mirror,
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:57.180]   what you're doing is you're generating
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.220]   anti-rotational forces.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:01.260]   You're requiring that your upper body not twist
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.420]   while you're lifting these loads.
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:05.620]   And what that does is it trains the obliques,
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:08.140]   it trains components of your abdominals,
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:10.300]   and to some extent, it's training components
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:12.860]   of your lower back, although not so much,
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.820]   as it is the obliques to the abdominals,
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:17.700]   that are anti-rotation, that are preventing your body
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:20.900]   from twisting while you're carrying out these movements.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:23.380]   And in doing so, you're also mimicking the way
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.900]   that a lot of movements are carried out in daily life.
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.500]   Because if you think about it, it's pretty uncommon
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.900]   that you're going to be lifting things with one arm
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.980]   with feet parallel.
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:33.220]   I mean, it happens, okay?
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:34.700]   There are times when feet are parallel
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.260]   and we're lifting something up with both hands.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.100]   There are times in which you do something similar
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.340]   to kind of the stance that you would be in
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:44.380]   for a dumbbell curl, you know, with feet parallel in the gym
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.700]   or a tricep extensions with feet parallel.
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.900]   But more often than not, as we move through life,
[01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.100]   one or the other feet is positioned in front of the other.
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:53.780]   And, you know, we're reaching for something
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:56.180]   or lifting something, or we're pulling something.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.940]   Those are the patterns that exist more typically
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.140]   in daily life.
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.020]   And those are the patterns of movement
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:04.940]   that typically people hurt themselves while doing.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.060]   You know, they reach down to get something
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:08.620]   out of a cabinet, they'll reach into the back
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:10.420]   and they'll twist a bit to grab something in the back
[01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:11.620]   and that's when their back will go.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.580]   Or they're reaching overhead to grab something
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:16.220]   and they're twisting as they reach with one arm.
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:19.180]   So I've certainly found, and this was supported by, again,
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.780]   all of the experts that I spoke to,
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.580]   that staggering one stance
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.340]   while performing resistance training,
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:27.700]   typically curls or overhead tricep extensions.
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:28.620]   And there aren't many other things
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.860]   that lend themselves well to this.
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:33.060]   So those are the two that I'm really focusing on.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.700]   Doing that while insisting, that is forcing yourself
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:38.860]   to keep your belly buttons facing completely forward.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:41.620]   Okay, not tilting to the side either way.
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:43.780]   That can really help strengthen the abdominals
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:46.300]   through the use of what's called anti-rotation.
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:47.940]   This is also what you're going to experience
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.980]   if you ever take a yoga class and you do a pose
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.700]   where it's arms overhead, like a warrior two pose
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.260]   or a warrior one pose, and they'll say,
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:55.380]   make sure that your belly button
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:57.100]   is facing completely forward,
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.240]   that you're not twisting to the side too much.
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.120]   This is also what the instructor will tell you
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.400]   in a Pilates or a yoga class very often in certain movements
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.660]   where there's a tendency to kind of relax
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:09.900]   or sag into a twisted upper torso.
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.780]   Of course, there's some yoga and Pilates movements
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:13.360]   that require that you twist your upper torso,
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.980]   but that's not what we're talking about here.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.140]   This is when they tell you,
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:18.300]   keep your belly button facing forward.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:20.800]   You're generating anti-rotation forces,
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.220]   not just of the abdominals,
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:24.700]   but as the abdominals connect to the pelvis.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.940]   And of course, all of that is providing stability
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:27.940]   for the spine.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.140]   And then if you run down the legs in your mind,
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.820]   that is, and you think about your feet
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:35.480]   with those nice spread toes and the activated musculature
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.500]   on the base and the top of your feet
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:39.660]   and running up the front of your shin and your calves,
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.700]   well, you can really imagine how you're creating
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.260]   the most stable positioning on the floor,
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:45.740]   stable positioning of the spine.
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:49.260]   No wonder that the spine is not only going to experience
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:52.220]   less shearing stress, less pain,
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:55.980]   but you're also in a position to create a nice strong chain
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:58.140]   of activation from the nerves and muscles
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:00.420]   from the base of the floor all the way up to your neck,
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.020]   because you're already strengthening your neck.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.580]   Okay, so in terms of protocols,
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:07.780]   thus far we've covered Stumagil's big three.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:10.420]   Then we talked a little bit about things you can do
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:11.460]   to relieve pain.
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:13.380]   So this was the hanging from a bar
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.340]   with the toes touching the ground, right?
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:18.540]   As well as the kind of up dog or Cobra exercises.
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:20.220]   And then we talked about five or six things
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:22.780]   that one can do, including strengthening the neck,
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:25.220]   spreading the toes, strengthening the feet, et cetera,
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:27.380]   in order to generate strength and stability
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:30.500]   distal to the back and thereby to strengthen
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:31.860]   and pain-proof the back.
[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:34.680]   Now we're going to cover four final protocols
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:37.540]   to strengthen your back, pain-proof your back,
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:40.100]   and allow you the greatest degree of mobility,
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:42.140]   both for sake of mobility during exercise
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.380]   and in daily living.
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:45.420]   The first of those four protocols
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:48.820]   is going to be to activate and strengthen,
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.640]   and in some cases, de-spasm the medial glute,
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.800]   which is a muscle that most people don't think about.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:57.420]   The medial glute is involved in stabilizing the hips
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:59.980]   as you walk, as you run, okay?
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:01.780]   So it's going to prevent the pelvis
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:03.880]   from moving from side to side.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:06.080]   It's one that when it weakens,
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.100]   or when you have trouble activating it,
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:10.940]   can lead to some forms of what is perceived
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:12.360]   as lower back pain.
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.500]   So if you reach to your lower back
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.300]   and you feel these kind of like two,
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.760]   kind of like, almost like nodules
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:18.900]   at the top of your pelvis,
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.420]   a lot of people will experience pain
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:22.100]   in and around that region,
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.760]   or maybe even as a kind of a,
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.700]   like a belt of pain around that area, more or less.
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:31.140]   And in some, not all cases, but in some cases,
[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:33.500]   that's due to lack of medial glute activation,
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.460]   or in some cases, it's due to spasming
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.860]   of musculature in that region.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:37.780]   It's really hard to tell,
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:39.380]   unless you're being assessed by an expert,
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.220]   which one it is.
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.920]   Again, that's not what we're here to do.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.420]   What I am here to do is to provide you a protocol
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:46.820]   that I've found to be tremendously beneficial
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.780]   for relieving the sort of lower low back pain,
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:52.300]   and the kind of pain that even extends
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:54.820]   into the top of the glutes that many people experience,
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:56.620]   especially if you've been sitting a lot,
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:59.020]   if you've been driving a lot, flying a lot,
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:03.220]   if you find yourself doing a lot of hip hinging exercise,
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.020]   like squats, and then you travel.
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:07.500]   So you're sitting on a plane for a while,
[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.460]   and you don't pay mind to really stay in a flat back,
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:13.120]   or arched back position.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.640]   By the way, if you're somebody who has disc bulging
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:17.440]   in that direction that we talked about before,
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.620]   and can benefit from doing those Cobra poses,
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.760]   or kind of up dog pushups.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.980]   If you travel, or drive, or you're seated a lot for work,
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:28.880]   I, and many others, find it really beneficial
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.040]   to just take a towel, and just roll it up, and put it,
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.040]   so that you maintain the arch in your lower back,
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.600]   so you're not rounding in your seat.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.880]   That can be really useful,
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.040]   and it makes perfect sense if you think about it,
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.440]   given what we were talking about before,
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.440]   with the squeezing out of the cream of the Oreo cookie
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:43.280]   in that direction.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.600]   You want to make sure that you're not rounding
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:45.620]   your lower back too much.
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:47.120]   Keeping it straight, or a little bit arched,
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.520]   is going to be beneficial.
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:51.760]   Not overly arched, but straight, or a little bit arched,
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.360]   in a rolled up towel, or something of that sort,
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:56.400]   that you can put in your lower back,
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.080]   can really be helpful for that.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.680]   Now, the protocol here is to essentially activate,
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:04.440]   and de-spasm the medial glute.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:06.080]   This is actually a protocol that I learned
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.520]   from Jeff Cavalier, long before I ever met him,
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:11.360]   or he was on the podcast, which he's been on the podcast.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.200]   Jeff Cavalier has a YouTube channel called ATHLEANX,
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.480]   which has tons of zero-cost protocols
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.320]   for resistance training, for cardiovascular training.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.040]   He just provides so much useful information.
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.000]   Again, zero cost.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.440]   I've actually paid for his programs.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.080]   No, he didn't ask me to say that.
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:27.160]   He doesn't pay me to say that.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.440]   Over the years, I've paid to use various programs
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:32.200]   from ATHLEANX, and they've benefited me tremendously.
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.320]   I've customized them a bit for myself,
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.560]   but in any case, love the work he does.
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.720]   Grateful to call him a friend.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.880]   Extremely grateful that he was a guest on this podcast.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.560]   We'll provide a link to the episode that he did
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:47.040]   talking about exercise, and exercise physiology,
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.880]   and nutrition in the show note captions.
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:52.680]   In any event, the protocol here is to activate,
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:55.400]   and in some cases, de-spasm the medial glutes,
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:57.880]   which can be done in a very straightforward way,
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.240]   where you lie on your side,
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:01.840]   essentially like you were going to do a side plank.
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.600]   So you've got your elbow and your forearm on the ground,
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.120]   making that fist.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.480]   You would imagine you'd go into a side plank, except no.
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.760]   You're going to keep the lower leg,
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.720]   the leg that's in contact with the floor,
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:14.720]   against the floor.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.280]   You're going to take the leg that's on top.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:19.840]   You're going to point the toe down, okay?
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.000]   So you're not bridging up into a side plank.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.380]   You're just resting on the floor on your side.
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:27.120]   You take that top leg, point the toe down.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.520]   You bring that toe out in front of you,
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:31.000]   touch it to the floor,
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.880]   and then you're going to bring your heel back.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.520]   You're going to extend it, not overextend it,
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.800]   but extend it as far as you can,
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.400]   with your heel pointed toward the back wall
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.760]   and up towards the ceiling.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:42.960]   So you're trying to maintain
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:47.700]   that downward pointed toe effort, okay?
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.720]   Then you're going to lower it again, touch,
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.320]   bring it all the way back up.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.820]   You're going to do that for maybe five to 10 repetitions.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.140]   And then on the final repetition,
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:59.260]   you're going to hold it there in that raised position,
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:00.440]   not as long as you can,
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:03.560]   but probably anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds,
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:06.440]   depending on how much strength you have
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.520]   in your medial glutes to be able to do that.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.620]   And if you like, you can also take your hand on the side
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.680]   of the foot that you're raising, okay?
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.420]   So if you're lying on your left side,
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:17.840]   you're going to take your right hand
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.880]   and you're going to take your thumb
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.720]   and put it right at the top of your glutes.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:24.840]   And you'll feel when the leg is fully extended back
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.840]   with the heel towards the back wall and ceiling,
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.740]   you'll feel the muscle activate there
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:30.080]   and you can kind of push against it.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.420]   What are you doing when you do this?
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:33.560]   You're activating the medial glute.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.960]   You're, in some cases, despasming the medial glute
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.480]   and some of the musculature around there.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:40.880]   And many people find that they get considerable pain relief
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.000]   of that low, low back region when they do this exercise.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.440]   You, of course, would want to switch to the other side,
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:49.760]   even if you're not experiencing pain on the other side,
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:52.080]   and do the same thing for the opposite side.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.600]   So lying on your right-hand side,
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:57.280]   taking then your left leg, pointing the toe down,
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:59.240]   putting it in front of you, bringing it back,
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.360]   doing multiple repetitions of that.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.380]   And then holding it in a static hold
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:06.240]   while feeling that medial glute get activated,
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.140]   and then taking some rest.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.860]   This is the sort of thing that you can do
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:11.700]   if you're experiencing low, low back pain
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.320]   to see if it provides some relief.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.380]   Many people find it does provide that relief.
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:17.420]   If, of course, it exacerbates your pain,
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:18.480]   please stop doing it.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:21.460]   You never want to exacerbate pain in any kind of way.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:24.180]   But many people find that it relieves the pain
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:26.380]   in that low, low back region.
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.380]   And it does so not just during the exercise,
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.260]   but in the minutes and hours following.
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:33.040]   You may need to repeat this a couple of times per day.
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.080]   You may need to adjust your other activities,
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:35.980]   including exercise.
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:37.220]   It really depends on the severity
[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:40.060]   of your back pain and injury, the nature of it, et cetera.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:43.560]   However, it's something that many people, including I,
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.540]   also include in our regular routines.
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:47.760]   I'll sometimes do this as part of a warmup on leg day.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.460]   I'll sometimes do this just while, you know,
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:52.540]   watching TV or something, which I don't do terribly often.
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.220]   But I'll just take a couple of minutes,
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:56.620]   literally just two minutes or three minutes,
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:58.740]   and I'll do a couple sets of these on either side
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:01.300]   just to maintain that neuromuscular activation
[01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:02.340]   of the medial glute.
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:04.460]   Some people, I would say most people,
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:07.400]   are not very good at activating that medial glute region.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.540]   If you're somebody who is being conscientious
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:12.540]   and doing a lot of posterior chain work,
[01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:15.220]   such as kettlebell swings on a regular basis,
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:18.460]   you're doing glute ham raises, which I'm a huge fan of.
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:20.400]   I'll do an entire video about posterior chain
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.740]   and why I'm such a big fan of glute ham raises.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:24.180]   Unfortunately, you need a specialized piece
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:25.700]   of equipment to do them.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:28.220]   Or Nordic curls, such a big fan of Nordic curls,
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.620]   glute ham raises, et cetera, for all sorts of reasons,
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:33.140]   strengthening the back, strengthening the posterior chain,
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:34.940]   making sure you can still generate power
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.980]   in the pelvic region, lower back region,
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.880]   while maintaining posture, especially as you age,
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:39.960]   all of that.
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.700]   I'll talk more about those in a future episode
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.460]   But the point is this,
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.480]   many people just fail to get activation of the glutes
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.620]   in a way that supports their lower back
[01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.300]   and allows them to strengthen their back
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:54.540]   to the extent that they would otherwise.
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:56.260]   And much of the time, it's not just a failure
[01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:58.580]   to activate the glutes, because of course,
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.180]   there are many ways to activate the glutes.
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:02.900]   There are all sorts of exercises you can read about online,
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:05.140]   but a failure to activate the medial glute muscles
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:08.140]   in particular that people need to overcome
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:10.940]   by strengthening those nerve to muscle pathways.
[01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:12.580]   And of course, I'm talking about activation
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:15.180]   of the medial glutes and de-spasming of the medial glute,
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:16.700]   which is really what happens when you hold
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:19.100]   that medial glute contraction for some period of time,
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.260]   then afterwards, you allow some relaxation
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:22.900]   in those neural pathways.
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:25.060]   That is often, again, not always,
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:28.240]   but often the cause of that low, low back pain.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.100]   So if you have low, low back pain,
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:32.540]   and it's safe for you to perform this exercise,
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:33.860]   I encourage you to give it a try.
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.740]   Again, it requires no equipment.
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:37.940]   It's very easy, takes almost no time.
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:40.700]   And at least for me and many others that I've spoken to,
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.300]   it has been tremendously helpful
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:43.820]   in relieving that lower back pain
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:45.940]   by de-spasming the medial glute.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.860]   And at the same time,
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.020]   allowing for nerve to muscle activation of the medial glute
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:53.780]   such that the medial glutes can be active when they need to
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.300]   in order to stabilize the pelvis
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.740]   and allow for the strongest possible pelvic spine interface.
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:00.940]   Okay, so the next protocol
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.980]   is one that you can do essentially anywhere.
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:06.500]   It takes almost no time, and it's a wonderful one
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:11.460]   because it allows for stretching of the psoas muscle, right?
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:15.660]   The muscle that is easy to say and hard to spell, psoas.
[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:17.680]   It's P-S-O-A-S, right?
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.220]   I think the P is generally silent.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:21.140]   You'd say psoas muscle.
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:24.520]   The psoas muscle is involved in connecting the spine
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:25.620]   to the pelvis, okay?
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:28.460]   It also has an interaction with the diaphragm
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.380]   that's really important,
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.620]   this muscle that's important for breathing.
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:34.420]   And many people have tightening the psoas,
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.100]   tightening of the hip flexors,
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.980]   but being able to stretch the psoas muscle
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:43.500]   is something that provides a ton of relief to the tightness
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.440]   that one can experience from sitting too much,
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.720]   from being in a hip hinge position too much,
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.420]   especially if you're doing heavy hip hinge work
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:52.780]   and then you're sitting or driving a lot.
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:56.340]   And many people also just carry a lot of stress
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:59.460]   in their midsection and relieving or stretching the psoas
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:00.940]   can be very beneficial.
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:02.880]   Okay, there's a lot about this that could be said.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.660]   In fact, I'll probably do an entire episode
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:07.100]   about psoas and fascia.
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:08.260]   Okay, I know there's a lot of requests
[01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:09.100]   to talk about fascia,
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.820]   but it's far too much to get into now.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:13.020]   Here's the protocol that I do believe
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:14.740]   everyone can benefit from.
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.940]   I don't care how bendy you are, how rigid you are,
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:20.860]   how big you are, how live you are, how slim you are.
[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:22.300]   This is a wonderful exercise.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:24.020]   It just feels so good.
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:27.900]   And it allows you to afterwards be in a long spine posture
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:30.180]   to really feel opened up at the hips, if you will.
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.940]   Now I'm using yoga type language,
[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:33.680]   but I think you understand what I mean.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:36.200]   And it is a great stress reliever as well,
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:38.040]   which is essentially to do
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.620]   what looks like a warrior two position in yoga.
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:42.820]   So you're essentially doing a lunge, okay,
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:45.500]   where you're going to lunge with one leg back
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:49.380]   and the other leg forward, of course, that's a lunge.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:53.020]   And then you're going to take the hand on the same side
[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:55.880]   as the leg that's extended behind you,
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:58.600]   reach that toward the ceiling, okay?
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:03.600]   And then you're going to rotate pinky clockwise, okay?
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:06.160]   The other way to think about this
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:10.160]   is to put the palm of your hand parallel to the ceiling.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:13.440]   If you're doing it outside, parallel to the sky, okay?
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.240]   So you're going to get into the longest lunge
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.080]   that you safely can for you, okay?
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.720]   That's going to differ for everybody.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.340]   And then you're going to raise the arm on the same side
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:23.320]   as the leg that's extended backward.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:27.080]   And you're going to go parallel palm to the sky
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.000]   or to the ceiling.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.760]   This will provide a stretch all the way,
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.920]   or you should feel a stretch all the way
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.840]   from your wrist down past your hip
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:39.680]   and possibly even into the foot that's behind you.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:42.880]   Now, Dr. Stuart McGill showed me this.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.840]   I've certainly done warrior two pose in yoga classes.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:48.200]   And when I've done yoga at home from time to time,
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:50.600]   I wasn't new to raising an arm overhead
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.720]   while stretching in a lunge position.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:55.720]   But Dr. Sue McGill was the one who really emphasized
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:58.680]   that by putting the palm parallel to the sky,
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.920]   to the ceiling and twisting a bit
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:03.860]   so that you're turning that pinky toward,
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.960]   I would say the best way to describe this
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.840]   is to turn that pinky toward your head, okay?
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:10.920]   Not away from your head, but toward your head
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.680]   while still maintaining a flat palm
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:14.160]   and reaching as much as you can
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:18.000]   and extending all the way from the heel of that back foot
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.520]   all the way up to your palm
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:22.140]   that you're getting stretching, not just of the psoas,
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:24.040]   but that you're also getting activation
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:27.300]   of some of the neurofascial aspects
[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:29.980]   going from palm all the way to heel
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:32.700]   that provide some relief,
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:34.980]   that is some relaxation of the musculature
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:36.820]   that otherwise is providing tension
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:38.900]   of the spine pelvic interface.
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:43.060]   And that can allow for better posture, longer spine,
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:46.300]   and at the same time, strong spine positioning
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:47.580]   after you do the exercise.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.980]   And of course you want to do this on both sides.
[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:52.340]   Now, I realize that many of you are just listening to this.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:53.220]   You're not watching this,
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:55.440]   but even for those of you that are watching on YouTube,
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.940]   it's very difficult since I'm seated behind a desk
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.940]   to show you the proper form of this exercise,
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:02.600]   which is why we've provided a link
[01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.780]   to a visual of this exercise in the show note captions
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.040]   that you can go look at otherwise.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.600]   But hopefully it's clear to you.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:13.240]   It's basically a lunge, front leg slightly bent at the knee,
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.700]   back leg, perhaps slightly bent, but extended behind you.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.740]   So you're in a lunge position,
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:22.200]   arm on the same side as the extended leg raised overhead,
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.380]   palm parallel to the ceiling, okay, with arm extended
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:28.960]   and turning your wrist a bit
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.040]   so that your pinky is more or less
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:33.500]   trying to point towards your head.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.140]   Although most people, including myself,
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:38.200]   probably don't have the flexibility to do that all the way
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.100]   so that your pinky is pointed towards your head.
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:41.860]   I encourage you to experiment with this a little bit
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:43.740]   until you feel that stretch all the way
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:45.560]   from hand down to heel.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.020]   It feels really good to do.
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.640]   You can hold it for anywhere from five to 10 seconds.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:51.380]   You can exhale or inhale.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:52.220]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:53.600]   You can just breathe normally.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.600]   The point here is that you're getting a terrific stretch
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:56.860]   of the psoas.
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:58.020]   You then switch to the other side,
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.300]   get a terrific stretch of the other side psoas.
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:03.940]   And after you move out of this pose,
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:05.860]   you will definitely feel as if you sort of have
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:07.560]   "lengthened the spine."
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.320]   You know, the extent to which you have lengthened the spine
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.160]   isn't clear.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:11.400]   What more likely has happened
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.280]   is that you have some relaxation
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:14.920]   and perhaps even some lengthening
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:17.720]   between the spine and pelvic connection.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:19.920]   So then you can sit upright, nice straight spine,
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.200]   and you're not being pulled forward by that tightened psoas
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:25.280]   that connects the spine to the pelvis.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.320]   Okay, so that's sort of the simplest way
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.520]   that I can describe all that.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:30.000]   It's a wonderful exercise to do.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.200]   You can do it in an airport.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.160]   You can do it when you get home.
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.880]   You can do it when you get out of the car.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:37.260]   It's one of those things that provides a ton of relief
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.140]   in terms of kind of stress and compression
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:41.140]   and C-shaping of the spine from sitting
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:44.260]   that most all of us are doing too much of these days.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:46.780]   And as Dr. Stu McGill will explain
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:48.100]   when he comes on the podcast,
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:52.900]   it also provides some both activation and relaxation
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:55.820]   of the nerve to fascial to muscle interface
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:59.960]   that's so critical for having a strong and pain-free spine.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:02.940]   Okay, so the final protocol I want to share with you today,
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:05.020]   believe it or not, is purely mental.
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:06.500]   It's purely cognitive.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:07.980]   It doesn't involve any movement.
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:11.500]   What it does involve is developing an awareness
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.700]   of your movement patterns
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.220]   as you move through your daily life,
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:17.140]   including exercise, but not limited to exercise.
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:18.140]   What do I mean by this?
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:20.060]   Well, based on what I told you
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:21.420]   at the beginning of today's episode
[01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:22.580]   and throughout today's episode,
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:24.980]   you are now armed with knowledge
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.220]   about the different components of back anatomy,
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:31.240]   the vertebrae, the discs, the nerves, the muscles,
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.620]   and how those relate to one another
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:35.340]   and how bulging, that is herniating of the discs,
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:38.860]   or I would hope not, but even rupturing of the discs
[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.860]   or inflammation in a particular spinal segment
[01:57:41.860 --> 01:57:45.700]   or maybe tonic static contraction at the level of the neck
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:47.300]   or lack of strength in the feet,
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.220]   how that could create back pain,
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:52.340]   how that could limit back mobility,
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:54.780]   how that could limit overall mobility.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:56.780]   So the final protocol of today's episode
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:58.940]   is for you to really pay attention
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:02.940]   to any pain you might happen to have in your back region
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:05.540]   and any kind of limitation you have
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:08.200]   in terms of its ability to manage loads
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:09.800]   or to generate the kinds of movement
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:11.220]   that you need for your life.
[01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.140]   What do I mean by this?
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:13.260]   Well, if you're somebody
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:17.100]   who has a lot of lower back stiffness, lower back pain,
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:20.300]   you might ask yourself, okay, when I drive, when I sit,
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:22.060]   even if I use a standing desk,
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:24.360]   what is the position of my feet?
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:26.580]   Are they directly underneath my pelvis?
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.900]   Am I rounding my back?
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.620]   If you're somebody who has a lot of pain
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:31.660]   in your low to mid back,
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:34.500]   and you find just by way of observation
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.880]   that you're rounding your back a lot of the time,
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:38.860]   either because you're texting or typing,
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:41.340]   maybe you need to take a towel and roll it up
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:42.800]   and put it in your lower back region.
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.940]   Maybe you need to just spend a little bit more time
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:47.340]   each day, not all day, but a little bit of time
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:49.780]   being consciously aware of maintaining
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.200]   a little bit of lower back arch
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.040]   or maybe even a straight back
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:55.100]   if you can't arch your back in that way.
[01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:57.500]   If you're somebody who's standing at your standing desk
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:00.900]   or even just talking to friends or family members,
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.380]   do you always lean to one side?
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.660]   Do you always relax to one hip?
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:06.260]   Is that because you're not activating the medial glute
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:08.900]   on one side more than the other or either?
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:12.340]   Or is it because you tend to stand with one foot
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:13.160]   in front of the other
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:14.980]   or you're not maintaining enough toe spread
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:16.260]   or you don't have the strength in your feet
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.940]   to kind of stabilize yourself?
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:20.620]   Are you relaxed with your breathing
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:23.460]   and letting your belly go out when you're not exercising?
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:26.100]   These are the sorts of things that once you start to observe
[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:27.180]   and by the way, you don't have to become
[01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:29.180]   neurotically self-observant all the time
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:31.180]   about your back and your breathing and your foot position.
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:32.820]   That's not what we want, okay?
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:35.240]   That is absolutely not the goal here.
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:37.680]   But if you're experiencing back tightness
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:39.700]   or shoulder tightness, you should ask yourself,
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:42.820]   are you constantly like thumbs pointed in,
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:44.160]   shoulders rolled forward?
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:46.060]   Are you doing enough pulling exercises
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:47.860]   to balance out all the pushing exercises
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:50.000]   you might be doing like pushups and shoulder presses
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:50.840]   and bench presses?
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.340]   Make sure you're balancing the back musculature
[01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:55.920]   and the shoulder and chest musculature.
[01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:58.300]   These kinds of things are extremely valuable
[01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.860]   to pay attention to because oftentimes
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:05.860]   the origin of your back pain or the origin of your sciatica
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:09.600]   or the origin of your neck pain and tension
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:12.680]   is something that can be fairly simply remedied.
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:14.520]   It doesn't necessarily mean you have an injury.
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:16.860]   Maybe you have a small degree of disc bulging.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.280]   And if so, what direction is that bulging?
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.680]   Is it toward the front of your spine, the side?
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.540]   Is it toward the back?
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:24.740]   And if so, what are you going to do to adjust it?
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:25.960]   Are you going to do, you know,
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:28.560]   one or two sets of those Cobra pushups each day?
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:30.360]   Are you going to put that, you know,
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:32.560]   towel rolled up behind your back
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:34.800]   in order to make sure that that bulge
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.960]   doesn't increase further?
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.200]   Are you going to avoid doing a lot of crunching in the gym?
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:41.220]   Many of you are going to need to avoid doing crunching
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:44.040]   and finding other ab exercises like the roll-up
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:46.480]   to do in order to still strengthen your abdominals,
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:48.760]   which is so important for stabilizing the spine
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.880]   and having a strong pain-free back.
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:54.080]   But you don't want to generate more forward rolling
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.260]   and bulging of the discs out the back of the spine
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:58.480]   for all the reasons that are now obvious to you.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.560]   So this final protocol is one that I could go on
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:05.160]   for hours about, but really it's for you to think about
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:08.040]   for just a couple of minutes, for a couple of days.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:10.160]   And just pay attention to your movement patterns,
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:12.960]   how you stand at rest, how you breathe at rest,
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:15.560]   whether or not you're using best possible posture
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.200]   or whether or not you're using postures
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:20.520]   and patterns of overuse in your daily life and in sport.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:22.920]   These things can really build up some strong imbalances
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:24.760]   and neuromuscular activation patterns
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:27.600]   that over time can translate into pain.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.560]   And even if they don't translate into pain,
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:32.720]   can translate into a weakened back system
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.160]   or put more appropriately, a weakened body system
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:39.440]   where you're always sagging one shoulder
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:41.500]   or you're not breathing properly
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:43.880]   because your chin is always towards your chest,
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:44.760]   these kinds of things.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:46.560]   Now, today's episode is certainly not geared
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:49.680]   towards fixing every aspect of your posture,
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:52.080]   your movement patterns, strengthening your back
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.240]   and removing your back pain.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:57.220]   However, I will say that thanks to the information
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:59.120]   that's out there from the peer reviewed literature
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.760]   and from these fabulous practitioners,
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.320]   again, MDs, PTs, folks even in the chiropractic community,
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.440]   I say even because oftentimes they take a lot of heat
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.800]   from people in the other communities.
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:13.080]   But again, there's a range of quality of practitioners
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:14.880]   in all these different domains.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.660]   They've really started to explore these different aspects
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:21.480]   of back strengthening and removing pain from the back
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:23.840]   in ways that sure, they come to the table
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:26.160]   through different lenses of training, right?
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.140]   Some are going to talk about laser therapy.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:30.200]   And by the way, we didn't cover that on purpose.
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.680]   There's a little bit of evidence,
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:34.280]   but it's not super strong for laser therapy for the back.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.000]   Okay, there, I just upset all the people
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.220]   who are into laser therapy.
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:39.860]   We'll get into that in a future episode.
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.800]   Sure, there's evidence that Pilates, that yoga,
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:45.360]   walking has been shown to be tremendously beneficial
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:46.200]   for back pain.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:47.760]   There's wonderful evidence for any
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:50.040]   and all of those different practices.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.360]   What I've tried to focus on today
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.160]   were protocols that practitioners who spend most,
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.400]   if not all of their careers,
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.920]   thinking about strengthening the back
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:01.880]   and pain proofing the back generally agree on.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:04.320]   Okay, I realize there isn't going to be universal consensus,
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.300]   but they generally agree that Stu McGill's big three,
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:11.880]   the curl up, the side plank, the bird dog.
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:13.800]   They generally agree that strengthening
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:18.800]   the stabilization muscles and pathways from feet up to hips
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.720]   and all the way to shoulders and top of the head,
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:22.000]   including the neck,
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.560]   including breathing in a particular way while relaxed,
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:26.600]   while not exercising.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.360]   Again, those would be belly breaths,
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:29.360]   ideally through the nose,
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.320]   unless you're talking or you're eating.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.240]   Making sure that your abdominals are strong,
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:35.520]   not just from crunching,
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.380]   but that you're activating the obliques,
[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:39.840]   that the muscles between your ribs are strong,
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:42.720]   something that can really benefit from anti-rotation work
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:45.100]   so that you can generate a stiff, stable spine,
[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:47.200]   which is great provided you can do that
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:48.520]   when you want to voluntarily,
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:49.680]   and then you can relax
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:52.120]   and you can move about your days still in great posture,
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.760]   still in a strong position,
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:55.280]   but without having to brace all the time,
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:57.380]   which is obviously something you don't want to have to do
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:58.960]   as you move through your life.
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.960]   And having a number of different stretches
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:03.080]   that allow for lengthening of the spine.
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:05.300]   We talked earlier about hanging from a bar
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:06.540]   with feet touching the ground
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:09.100]   so that you can create some space to alleviate,
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:12.800]   hopefully, some of the disc bulge to nerve impingement
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:14.560]   that might be causing pain,
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:17.520]   that you might want to do those Cobra type pushups
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.080]   or those up dog type movements
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:22.140]   that can provide some kind of pushing back
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:23.980]   of the cream between the two Oreo cookies
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:25.800]   that I use this in an analogy
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.320]   for the discs and the spinal segments.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.680]   These are the sorts of things that most all of the data
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.040]   and most all of the experts in the field generally agree on.
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.080]   And so I've offered them to you today
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:39.040]   in the form of this list of protocols.
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:41.020]   There are about a dozen of them, I realize.
[02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:43.560]   Again, we have links to examples of them
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:45.880]   in video form in the show note captions.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:48.640]   I certainly don't expect that everybody's going to do
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:50.080]   all of these every day.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.120]   That's by no means the expectation.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:55.200]   Think of these more or less as a buffet of things
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:57.760]   that you could explore and experiment with
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:59.840]   depending on whether or not you have back pain,
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.900]   in which case, please proceed towards them
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:03.320]   with a lot of caution.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:06.240]   Please remember also that I am not saying
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.400]   that epidurals, painkillers, surgery,
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.120]   and other methods for treating back pain are not useful.
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:12.760]   I am certainly not saying that.
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.840]   Those certainly have their place.
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.480]   And yet I would say many people,
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:19.820]   if not many or even all adults,
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:22.420]   could certainly benefit from thinking about
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:25.100]   how their back interfaces with their pelvis,
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:27.560]   their legs, their feet, their neck, and vice versa,
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:30.200]   and thinking about how to strengthen that entire system
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:33.320]   by creating a strong core, a strong lower back,
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.560]   generating the proper movement patterns,
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:37.520]   and doing so through protocols
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:38.920]   like the ones I described today
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:41.840]   that don't take a lot of time, require zero equipment.
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:43.080]   They're essentially zero cost
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.240]   except for the minimal time investment required,
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:47.180]   and that have been shown time and time again
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:50.120]   to lead to a stronger pain-free back.
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:52.680]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.740]   I do read all the comments.
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.680]   Not so much during today's episode,
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:26.200]   but on many previous episodes of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:27.600]   we discussed supplements.
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:29.760]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.840]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:33.360]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:35.320]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:36.640]   To learn more about the supplements
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:38.280]   discussed on the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:41.040]   please go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:44.060]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:46.180]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:48.960]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media channels.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.960]   So that's Instagram, X, Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.360]   And on all of those platforms,
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:56.600]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:58.200]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.640]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.480]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.960]   on the "Huberman Lab" podcast.
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:06.000]   Again, that's @hubermanlab on all social media channels.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.280]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.160]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:10.480]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:12.400]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:15.140]   that includes podcast summaries, as well as protocols,
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:18.000]   in the form of brief one- to three-page PDFs,
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.320]   where I explain, for instance,
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:22.160]   protocols for learning and neuroplasticity,
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:23.600]   or for deliberate cold exposure.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:25.800]   We have a foundational fitness protocol,
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:27.160]   which explains the fitness program
[02:07:27.160 --> 02:07:28.800]   that I personally have followed,
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:31.000]   more or less, for the last 30 years or so.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.480]   It includes a resistance training, cardiovascular training,
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:35.080]   and we have protocols that relate to things
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.780]   like optimizing dopamine, sleep, and on and on.
[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:40.040]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:43.200]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the menu tab,
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:46.000]   scroll down to newsletter, and put in your email.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.120]   And I should point out that we do not share your email
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:49.000]   with anybody.
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.080]   I'd like to thank you once again
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:51.600]   for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:54.640]   all about how to strengthen and pain-proof your back.
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:56.940]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:58.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:01.380]   [upbeat music]
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:03.960]   (upbeat music)
