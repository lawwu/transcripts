[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.000]   - I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.540]   episode 169.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.600]   I'm here as always in the Deep Work HQ.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.380]   Happy to announce that Jesse is back.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.440]   Jesse, you look healthy and hale over there.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.400]   - I'm doing okay, it's good to be back.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.120]   - I forgot in just the two sessions you weren't here,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.440]   how much time it takes me, how slow I am.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.720]   And all the clicking and dragging that is involved
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.200]   manipulating the computer to actually record these episodes.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.640]   I got spoiled with you being here.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.240]   When I had to go back and do it by myself,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.120]   I was like putting a two-year-old on a computer.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.520]   It's like, let me click on that
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.760]   and let me, it took me forever, man.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.880]   So I'm glad you're back, let's put it that way.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.840]   - Yeah, it's good to be back.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.400]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.360]   - You look good, you're healthy, everything fine?
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.880]   - Yeah, I'm doing totally fine.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.400]   I was, you know, followed the protocols and now I'm back.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.840]   - Yeah, now I think if my reading
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.640]   of the medical literature is correct,
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.200]   because you have had vaccine shots and you got COVID,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.920]   you are now, and I believe this is the technical term,
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.760]   immortal.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.560]   Do I have that right?
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.880]   I don't know if I have the science quite right,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.920]   but that's what I understand from med Twitter,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.240]   that you are now immortal.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.960]   - That sounds good, I'll take it.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.920]   - That'd be an interesting turn for our show
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.480]   if we just had a large segment each week
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.240]   that was just us giving terrible COVID advice.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.080]   It was just, it was just so wrong.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.640]   I'm like, Jesse, I'm not sure if you know this,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.320]   but users of the time block planner,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.960]   70% less likely to be mechanically ventilated.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.640]   So let me just put that out there.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.840]   Did we just get kicked off YouTube?
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.440]   - Hopefully not, we just had the channel.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.560]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.760]   Yeah, maybe this would not be the best idea.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.920]   YouTube, that was satire.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.160]   The time block planning has no association
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.400]   with COVID outcomes.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.840]   Yeah, maybe we should stick with this type of advice.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.480]   But there is a connection
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.400]   because while Jesse was in COVID isolation,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.880]   that actually gave enough time for us
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.480]   to get the YouTube channel launched.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.320]   That is rolling right now, we're excited about it.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.160]   Jesse, what's the update?
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.680]   What do we need to know about the YouTube channel?
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.200]   Everything's rolling fine?
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.040]   - Everything's rolling.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.440]   We're in the first stage, so all the videos are up.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.360]   We've got to fix some of the intro music,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.640]   which I'm in the process of doing
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.800]   'cause people said it was too loud,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.960]   which going back on it, they were right.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   And then we'll continue to fix the thumbnails and stuff.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.800]   We had some good fan feedback about some stuff
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.080]   and they had some good advice.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   We're gonna implement that
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.560]   and then keep on putting out a lot of videos.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.360]   - And what's the timeline people should expect?
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.920]   So if you're listening to this episode,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.280]   let's say the day it comes out on a Monday,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.800]   what's our rough timeline for when you can expect
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.400]   the video of each of the questions in today's episode
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.600]   to then be on YouTube?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.480]   - Pretty much within that day, maybe in the next day,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.960]   but going for like in a month, like definitely that day.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.360]   - Oh, okay, excellent. - Yeah, that's my goal.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.720]   - Yeah, that's even better than I thought.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.360]   So, all right, so as you know, audience,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.480]   every question, every deep dive is going
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.120]   onto the YouTube channel with its own standalone video.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.360]   So you can now go back and review, save, share,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.760]   whatever you wanna do with the individual questions
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.400]   that particularly interest you.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.200]   And as Jesse just said,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.240]   within a day or two of these episodes going live,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.920]   you should be able to find those questions.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.520]   Right now we have some basic playlist on there.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.480]   I think we're doing full episodes, deep dives,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.000]   deep work questions, deep life questions.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.640]   As we put more and more videos up there,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.960]   we'll put more refined playlists,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.880]   sort of sub topics that are popular.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.960]   So feel free to send suggestions about,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.240]   hey, what playlist would you like to see, et cetera.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.920]   Jesse, can they send this right to you?
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.480]   Is that, is your Jesse address at calnewpoy.com?
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.320]   - It works. - It works.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.680]   - I was emailing with, I forget the one guy's name,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.200]   but I was emailing with the one guy
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.680]   and he gave some really good advice.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.520]   - Oh, there we go.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.320]   So thoughts on the YouTube channel,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.040]   be it like what playlist we should break these videos in
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.320]   or technical things about whatever,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.720]   jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.240]   Jesse is the maestro of the YouTube.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.520]   So he will take a look at that.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.360]   All right, so I wanna do a deep dive today.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.920]   It's a new special class of deep dive
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.880]   that I just wanna briefly motivate.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.920]   So I wanna do a series of deep dives,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.240]   maybe not every episode, but on a lot of episodes
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.400]   in the near future that I'm calling core ideas.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.440]   And the idea is to go back and revisit the big ideas
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.760]   from my writing that we talk about
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.440]   all the time on this show.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.480]   Listeners who have been here since the beginning
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.120]   know these ideas pretty well.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   I've talked about them before, but for newer listeners,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.040]   for newer viewers, they don't always know exactly
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.360]   what we're talking about or what the details are.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.800]   And now that we have the ability to post video
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.320]   of just these segments, I thought we should have a deep dive
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.040]   on each of the core ideas I talk about
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.640]   so I can just reference it.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.080]   Hey, if you need to remind yourself about the deep life
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.200]   or my time management philosophy or career capital
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.400]   or what have you, just go watch the core idea video
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.280]   and you can quickly get back up to speed.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.560]   So we're gonna start that today.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   Today, I wanna do my first core idea deep dive,
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.640]   I should say my first core idea deep dive
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.640]   and the topic I wanna do it on is time management.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.480]   So my goal here is to give a brief summary
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.360]   of my thinking about time management
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.520]   and what that's gonna consist of is let me define for you
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.080]   what I mean by time management.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   Let me give you the three principles in my writing
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.800]   and on this podcast, we always talk about
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.320]   that any good time management system
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.800]   should probably satisfy and then I will briefly talk
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.680]   through my particular system, which we can think of
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.840]   as one example of a time management system
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.520]   that satisfies these principles.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.360]   So you can do something else,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.720]   but so you see what a real fully fledged
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.160]   time management system that satisfies
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000]   these principles look like.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.640]   And then I'm gonna have a bonus fourth principle
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.000]   I wanna talk about that debatably
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   is not really about time management,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.040]   it lives right outside time management, but it's related.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.680]   So I'm gonna talk about that briefly at the end.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   So that is my agenda for this core idea discussion
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.040]   on time management.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.560]   So let's start what do I mean by time management for me,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.720]   at least in the context of this discussion,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.080]   I'm thinking about work.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   So time management in work, the way you deal with your time
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.720]   outside of work is a little bit different.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.680]   So I'm gonna put that aside.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.960]   And in the context of work,
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.000]   I'm gonna define time management to be
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.440]   whatever philosophy process systems or rules
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.960]   that you deploy to make decisions
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.560]   about what you're gonna do right now with your time.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.360]   How do you figure out it's 1226 on a Friday,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.660]   what do I do next?
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.720]   In the end, that's what a time management system is,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.240]   a way to help you answer that question
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.240]   in as useful a manner as possible.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.080]   Now, everyone who works has some sort of
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.140]   time management system they're using.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.680]   If you don't know what it's called,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.320]   if you can't tell me the details of it,
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.680]   if you've never thought about that,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.680]   it's just a really bad one, probably,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.500]   but you still have one, one way or the other,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.600]   you're making these decisions.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.480]   The question is just how do we wanna make these decisions?
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.080]   What is going to work better?
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.400]   So I'm gonna give you the three properties
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.460]   I think any good time management system should have.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.440]   I love alliteration,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.820]   long-time listeners of the podcast know this.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.880]   I love Cs in my alliteration,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.380]   as long-time listeners of this podcast know.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.720]   So I named the three key properties here with three Cs,
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.440]   capture, configure, control.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.280]   Let's talk about these each briefly in the abstract,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.680]   and I'll tell you about my system that satisfies these.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.100]   Number one, capture.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.880]   I believe a good professional time management system
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.480]   needs to have some place in which you store
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.880]   all the information that's important to making decisions
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.120]   about what you need to be doing
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.000]   and what you should be doing, that is trusted.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.620]   It's a place that you are going to look at,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.120]   things that go in there will not be forgotten.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.560]   These ideas get out of your head and into a system
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.720]   so you're not wasting brain cycles
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.760]   on trying to remember or keep fresh
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.160]   stuff that you need to do.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   Now, in the context of tasks,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.920]   we can give credit to this idea to David Allen.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.080]   So David Allen and his seminal
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.640]   post-computer time management book,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.840]   and I mean that very specifically
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   because as I've written about before,
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.920]   time management goes through big evolution.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.160]   So post-computers, computer networks, and email,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.680]   time management went through a big revolution
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   and David Allen was there at the beginning.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.840]   He had this idea of full capture,
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.880]   where he said all of your tasks should be in a trusted system
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.840]   that you review regularly, not in your head.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.360]   He actually adapted that idea
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.180]   from a previous business thinker named Dean Acheson,
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.920]   unrelated to President Truman, Secretary of State,
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.680]   same name, different person, who had first developed,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.200]   I believe in the 1970s, this notion of full capture
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.480]   and David Allen expanded it.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.460]   So that's really the core of this.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.080]   And David Allen's articulation of full capture said,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.000]   don't waste mental energy remembering things,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.120]   have it in a system so your brain can be clear
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.840]   to actually focus on working.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.560]   This also reduces a lot of stress
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.800]   because your brain gets stressed
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.040]   when it's worried about forgetting things you need to do.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.840]   I generalize capture though, beyond what Allen talks about.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.160]   In addition to each of your commitments
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.320]   being somewhere you trust,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.640]   I want your plans to also be somewhere you trust.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.960]   So any thinking you've done
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.240]   about what you're working on
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.720]   on all sorts of different timescales,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.520]   that should be written down somewhere you trust
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.400]   and review regularly as well.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.820]   I think that's often overlooked,
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.060]   but the planning process of what's going on,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.280]   how do I wanna get my work done?
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.660]   What needs to be done this semester?
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.120]   What do I have to get done this week to hit this goal?
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.280]   That's a really important part of time management.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.240]   I don't want that all in your head.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.500]   That also gets captured.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.980]   All right, second property, configure.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.400]   All right, this is a twist that I've become
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.100]   increasingly a loud advocate for,
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.980]   which is care more about how you actually organize
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.920]   this information that you're capturing.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   I think you really need to think through,
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.080]   once I have this information written down somewhere,
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.360]   where do I put it?
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.960]   How do I organize it?
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.160]   Is it in categories?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.760]   Is it broken up by role?
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.200]   Equally important,
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.880]   getting the relevant information consolidated.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.840]   I'm really big on this.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.960]   So not only do you have a really smart organization
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.200]   for all the stuff on your plate,
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.120]   you're also gathering in one place
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.560]   all the relevant information.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.520]   You're not searching through your email inbox
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.200]   to try to remember what does this mean?
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.180]   And where are we?
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.640]   And what do I owe this person?
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.120]   I'm supposed to get back to Derek about the program codes.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.960]   What does that mean?
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.780]   Let me go through my inbox.
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.540]   Now, all that should be in one place.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.940]   So these are our two goals with organize.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.960]   A, that the information is organized well,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.560]   where what you wanna happen here,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.840]   what you wanna have happen here
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.160]   is that you can very quickly get the gestalt
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.920]   of what's on your plate, what's due, what's not,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.040]   who you're waiting to hear back from.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.760]   The information is put aside in such a way
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.560]   that it's not just a list with 100 things.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.120]   And two, all the relevant information is there.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.040]   I'm not scrambling around to figure out
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.320]   what I need to know to do this thing.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.760]   All the information is there.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.880]   All right, control.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.600]   The third property of a good time management system.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.200]   Control says, instead of being reactive
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.640]   in your decisions about what you wanna do with your time,
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.040]   and by reactive, I mean just saying,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.240]   okay, it's 1223 on Friday.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.540]   What do I wanna do next?
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.240]   I don't know, let me see what seems relevant.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.480]   Let me look at my inbox.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.020]   Let me look at Slack.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.560]   Maybe I'll look at a to-do list
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.640]   and try to choose something off of it.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.000]   Control says, don't be reactive.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.360]   Don't wait till you get to the moment
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.400]   to say, what should I do next?
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.800]   Instead, be proactive.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.640]   Make a plan for your time in advance
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.400]   that makes the most of the time
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.360]   that you actually have available.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.040]   So you think ahead, you look at the time you have available
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.560]   and you say, what do I wanna do with this?
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.480]   I'm planning the whole picture at once.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.280]   I'm not waiting till the moment to say what happens next.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.680]   Now, on the podcast, I talk often
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.200]   about doing this control at multiple timescales.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.360]   You'll hear me talk about multi-scale planning.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.760]   This is where that actually applies.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.400]   And what I recommend is that you should be doing
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.640]   this type of planning on three timescales,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.140]   quarterly, weekly, daily.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.880]   So quarterly, you have a plan
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.640]   for what you wanna try to get done that quarter.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.480]   What's important?
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.960]   What are the big projects you're working on?
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.460]   There could even be daily work
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.800]   that you wanna really emphasize,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.640]   like, look, I gotta get my cold calls up.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.200]   So every Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.320]   I spend the first hour doing cold calls, whatever it is,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.960]   but you're making this plan for the quarter,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.920]   looking ahead at the quarter.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   Is this a busy quarter, not a big quarter?
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.720]   What are the big deadlines this quarter?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.680]   Is there a huge trade fair halfway through it?
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.080]   That means the first half of the quarter
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.880]   has to be really focused on preparing for that trade fair.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.800]   You're looking at the whole picture of the quarter
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.080]   and at this pretty big granularity coming up with a plan.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.120]   Every week, you then look at that quarterly plan
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.760]   and produce a plan for the week ahead of you.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.960]   Now you're doing weekly planning.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.160]   And when you're doing weekly planning,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.760]   what you really wanna do is get a sense
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.400]   of what's gonna happen which day.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.000]   And then finally, you get down to the daily scale
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.720]   where you say, what am I actually doing
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.280]   during the hours of the day?
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.640]   So we're in weekly planning,
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.120]   you are looking at what am I gonna do
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.780]   the different days of this week?
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.280]   At daily planning, you're saying, here's my day.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.720]   I have a meeting here, I have a call here,
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.360]   I have two meetings here, here's a time that's free,
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.120]   what do I wanna do during that time?
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.680]   So multi-scale planning, I think is the right way
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.160]   to think about control.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.240]   You're giving your time a job as opposed to asking
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.720]   in the moment, what should I do next?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.240]   And so I think any good time management system
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.620]   should do capture, configure, control.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.000]   Let me talk briefly about my specific instantiation
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.760]   of these properties, what my time management system
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.100]   looks like at the moment.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.940]   So for capture, there is where I actually store
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.700]   the things I need to do, and I use Trello,
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.060]   which is a task board software system.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.460]   So it gives you a visual metaphor for cards on a board
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.580]   arranged vertically in columns.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.140]   I use Trello to keep track of tasks and commitments
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.160]   and I use Google Docs to keep track of plans,
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.420]   the plans I have about various things.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.660]   So Trello is where all my tasks are,
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.620]   Google Docs are where my plans live.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.820]   So that's where in multi-scale planning,
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.820]   my quarterly plan lives, that's where other plans live.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.380]   Jesse and I, for example, have a Google Doc
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.100]   where we have our plans for the podcast, et cetera.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.580]   Trello for tasks, Google Docs for plans.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.380]   In addition to the storage systems,
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.220]   you have to have the capture tool
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.300]   so the tools you use to capture things during the day
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.420]   on the fly that will then get later moved
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.660]   into those storage systems.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.380]   Now, for me, I use two main ones.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.060]   I have my TimeBlock Planner.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.580]   I am in a lucky situation where I was able to design
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.740]   and publish my own planner.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.660]   So you can obviously find out more about that
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.500]   at timeblockplanner.com, but that planner has
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.500]   for every day a page in which you can capture stuff.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.940]   So I capture stuff right in that planner.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.020]   On my computer, I also have a text file on my desktop.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.380]   I call it workingmemory.txt because I think of it
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.980]   as like an expansion of my actual working memory.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.260]   And I use that when I'm on my computer to capture things,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.780]   especially when I'm cleaning out my email.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.860]   I can just type much faster than I can write
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.820]   and I capture all sorts of notes in this document.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.460]   I work through ideas on the document.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.360]   It really is like an extension of my working memory.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.700]   So a lot gets captured in there.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.420]   If I'm in a meeting on Zoom,
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.300]   things are popping up I have to do,
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.940]   I'm writing it probably right there
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.220]   in that workingmemory.txt.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.700]   At the end of every day, I do a shutdown.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.700]   My planner even has a box I checked.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.900]   It says shutdown complete.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.660]   That indicates I've done my shutdown.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.260]   As part of that shutdown process,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.520]   I look through everything in that planner,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.580]   everything in workingmemory.txt,
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.140]   and I get it into one of those more stable systems.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.380]   Goes on the Trello or I update my Google Doc.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.300]   So those things get pushed back down to zero.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.020]   They're temporary tools to capture
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.040]   and then they get moved into the more stable systems.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.660]   The one addendum I should add there is the calendar.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.100]   Obviously some of these things are appointments,
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.500]   so that goes right to the calendar.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.360]   All right, configure.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.140]   I mentioned I use Trello for my task.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.460]   The way I actually use Trello is I have a separate board
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.720]   for each of my different professional roles.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.540]   I keep a separate board as a writer,
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.900]   a separate board, for example, as a teacher,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.900]   which I keep as a separate board as a researcher, et cetera.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.540]   Those are then split up into columns.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.040]   There's a few standard columns
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.020]   that every one of these boards have.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.020]   I typically have a column where I put tasks on there
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.760]   that's called to be processed.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.660]   It's a pretty complicated thing I need to do,
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.460]   and I don't quite understand all the details of it,
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.020]   but I don't want to keep track of it in my head.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.620]   But also, you know, it's five o'clock and I'm shutting down.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.060]   I don't have time to spend 20 minutes figuring out
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.960]   what does this mean?
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.360]   Like, what are the actual actions here?
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.060]   So I'll just throw that in the to be processed column.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.820]   I usually have a column on each of these boards
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.460]   for waiting to hear back from.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.280]   So if I've sent someone a note
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.860]   and I need information from them,
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.080]   and that information is critical
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.300]   for me to keep making progress,
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.300]   I like to put a card on my Trello board
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.100]   under waiting to hear back that says,
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.780]   here's what I'm waiting to hear back from,
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.740]   and here's what I'm gonna do once I get that information.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.140]   I don't want to remember that in my head.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.980]   So I put it on there.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.180]   I typically have a column for things
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.500]   I'm working on this week.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.940]   And I'll typically have a column for,
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.460]   if there are specifically persistent initiatives
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.580]   within that role, I'll give it its own column.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.820]   So I can really quickly see for this thing I'm working on,
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.900]   what are all the different things that need to be done?
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.020]   So as a researcher, there might be a column for a paper
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.200]   we're preparing for publication.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.100]   In my administrative role at Georgetown,
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.060]   there might be a column for a search committee that I'm on.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.360]   Here's the relevant tasks.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.720]   The time that I really get into and clean this up
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.040]   and look at it and move things around and check in on it
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.360]   is when I do my weekly plan.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.440]   So once a week as part of my commitment to configure,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.540]   I really go through these systems and I update it.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.680]   Once a week when I'm building my weekly plan,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.360]   is also when I'm reviewing the Google Docs
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.560]   that capture these other types of plans that are going on
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.400]   and update them and remind myself what's on them.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.200]   So the weekly scale is when I'm really
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.800]   getting my hands dirty.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.000]   Throughout the week, I'm just throwing stuff into here
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.920]   at the end of each day, but each week I really go in
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   and clean things up.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.960]   All right, finally is control.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.160]   I already talked about multi-scale planning.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.680]   I think it's the best way to do control.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.500]   You could do it other ways, but I do,
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.040]   for me it's semester instead of quarterly,
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.920]   but semester, weekly, daily planning,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.480]   semester plans in a Google Doc, weekly plan.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.240]   I actually type it up in a text document and print it out.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.600]   And I keep it with me in the back of my time block planner.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.520]   So that's how, and I'll update it and reprint it
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.640]   as I need to throughout the week.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.720]   And then for my daily plan, I'm time blocking,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.240]   like I talked about, here's my day.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   Let me block off everything on my calendar.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.680]   Here's the time that remains.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.940]   What do I wanna do during that time?
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.920]   Well, let me look at my weekly plan to remind myself
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.080]   of what my big picture plan is for this day.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.520]   And then I'm blocking off actual hours of time
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.680]   and saying, here's what I'm doing here.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.400]   Here's what I'm doing there.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.760]   And I fill in all that information.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.260]   I do that right in my time block planner,
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.120]   but you can do this in any type of notebook.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.440]   There's a whole video at my site, timeblockplanner.com
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.600]   that walks through the details of how time blocking works.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.320]   So that is how I do the daily piece.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.760]   You put those all together,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.160]   there's my commitment to control.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.420]   All right, so stepping back, capture, configure, control.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.360]   You do those three things,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.720]   you're gonna be making smart decisions
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   about what you wanna be doing with your time professionally.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.680]   Now I know people get concerned.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.200]   They say, well, I might be injecting too much structure
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.800]   into my life and this is gonna make my work life more rigid
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.440]   and I'll be less creative.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.040]   I call nonsense and all of that.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.960]   Just because you're in control of everything
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.700]   doesn't mean you need to schedule every seven minutes
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.080]   of your time like a crazy person.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.120]   I mean, when you're in control of your time,
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.520]   you can now start to make decisions like,
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.000]   Thursday afternoon, starting at 12, I wanna do no work.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.840]   I'm gonna go to the woods
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.620]   and just think about this problem I'm working on.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.520]   When you're doing capture, configure, control,
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.800]   you could do that with confidence
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.000]   because you know what's on your plate,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.520]   you've cleared out that time,
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.980]   you know things aren't being forgotten.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.040]   You made sure that you had time on Wednesday
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.960]   to catch up on things people need to hear about Thursday.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.600]   Because you're in control,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.240]   you can aim that control at more breaks, more free time,
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.000]   more creativity, less stress.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.640]   You can significantly, like a lot of my listeners do,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.200]   reduce the amount of time it takes for you
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.400]   to get your normal workload done.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.040]   And because you're in complete control of things,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.400]   move it into certain days and keep whole days free
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.440]   to basically do phantom part-time jobs.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.120]   There's a lot you can do that makes your life
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   more interesting and creative and less stressful
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.780]   once you have an intentional way of making these decisions
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.680]   about what do I wanna do next with my time.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   All right, now I promised you a bonus property
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.500]   that arguably has to do with time management,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:43.560]   arguably it's something different,
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.680]   so I'll just mention it briefly.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.960]   And that is constrain.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:54.280]   So circling this whole idea is how you figure out
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.360]   what gets on your plate to be managed in the first place
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.500]   and how you actually manage that work.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.640]   Now I'm just gonna plant the seed here
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.760]   because this is a bigger conversation,
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.840]   but we need to be very careful about how we decide
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.860]   what we say yes to and what we say no to.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.020]   We would really like to avoid the situation
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.760]   where we have so much work on our plate
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.200]   that yeah, we can control it and be organized about it,
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.880]   but we still don't have enough time to get it done.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.880]   We wanna avoid that situation.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.160]   So having clear rules in place about how do I decide
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.660]   what I let on my plate, that's really important.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.320]   Processes is the second thing
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.720]   that I think is really important
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   when it comes to constraining,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.120]   figuring out how do I wanna do this work?
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.480]   The stuff I let on my plate,
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.900]   can I put a process in place
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.680]   that will reduce the footprint this has on my schedule?
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.320]   There's a lot of different things this can mean.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.140]   And again, because we're just seed planting here,
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.160]   I'm just gonna very briefly skim the surface,
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.520]   but there may be automation you're doing here.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.360]   You know what?
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.440]   We have to produce this same client report every week.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.920]   I don't wanna just send emails back and forth
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.440]   and kind of figure it out at the last minute.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.960]   Here is our process for doing it.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.120]   And you figure out a whole process that's the same thing,
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.220]   the same things happen at the same times every week,
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.720]   you can rely on it.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.940]   You've taken that burden off of your planning system
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.100]   to have to figure out from scratch.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.200]   For small questions and back and forth,
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.940]   you might push that all towards office hours.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.640]   Three days a week for one hour, well publicized,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.140]   I'm in my office, Zoom is on.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.540]   Come to that office hours
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.160]   if you have a small question for me.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.080]   Come to that office hours
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.480]   if there's a little bit of information you need.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.680]   Come to that office hours
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.980]   if there's something we can figure out
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.640]   in two minutes of back and forth.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.260]   And when people bother you with an email or Slack,
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.160]   like, "Hey, what are we doing again about this?"
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.880]   Or can explain to me again what this thing means,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.360]   just say, "Yeah, come to my office hours."
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.160]   These type of processes are all about reducing what it is
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.580]   that you actually do have to manage
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.480]   with your Capture Configure Control System.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.800]   You wanna simplify that, simplify what's on your plate,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.160]   simplify how the things that are on your plate are executed.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.360]   The easier you can make
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   the planning version of yourself's job,
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.680]   the better you're gonna do at your actual job.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.480]   All right, so let me summarize it there.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   That is my thinking on this core idea of time management.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:21.340]   All right, so that's a lot.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.800]   It's a lot on time management there, Jesse.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.200]   Do you do Capture Configure Control?
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.840]   Have I converted you yet to my full philosophy?
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.400]   - Oh yeah, like I was a fan
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.960]   when you first started your podcast,
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.000]   so I started implementing all that.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.120]   I actually do have a question though.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.400]   So in terms, what's the latest you ever put together
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.280]   your weekly plan?
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.440]   - Monday morning, yeah.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.080]   And sometimes, actually, let me be honest.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.320]   Sometimes, so I often do it on Mondays.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.560]   Sometimes I don't, like I'll have meetings
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   right off the bat on Monday or something like this.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.080]   And in those days, it'll actually get done later on Monday.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.880]   But basically, I wanna have my weekly plan done
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.880]   before I get to any non-spoken for time in that week.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.500]   So if I know I have a meeting from nine to 11, that's fine.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   But if at 12, I don't have something scheduled,
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.260]   I don't wanna make a decision about that
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.520]   without a weekly plan to reference.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.360]   And so I'll do that.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.060]   And it takes a long time, I should say, for me,
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.420]   because I have 17 jobs.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.860]   It can take me one to two hours to do my weekly plan.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.060]   And some people think that's crazy.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:25.900]   They're like, "That's two hours
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.720]   you could be getting work done."
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.980]   But I'm like, I'm telling you, man,
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.340]   if I do a good weekly plan
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.380]   and I spend two hours doing that weekly plan,
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.540]   I'm gonna get two X more done in the time that follows.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.140]   So I will trade two hours for two X factor increase
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.120]   on what I get done.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.340]   So it's worth it, man.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.080]   - Do you ever do it on Sundays?
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   - I don't do it on Sundays.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.600]   I gotta keep, so I'm pretty big on keeping weekends clear.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.700]   I gotta recharge.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.900]   So we don't work on Shabbat, I don't work on Saturday.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.740]   Sundays, I'll write.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.620]   I'll write on Sundays, Sunday mornings.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.660]   It's a long tradition I have,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.740]   but I do not wanna do email on Sundays.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.040]   If I can all avoid it, I don't wanna be,
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.260]   I don't wanna move my brain into the,
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.620]   okay, we're turned on for work mindset.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.740]   So I can go and write without having to completely
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.660]   go into the context of I got this meeting
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.660]   and this person needs this and this is due.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.020]   And so that's just part of my fixed schedule productivity
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.340]   notion, which we should do a core ideas video on,
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.120]   but fix the time you wanna work,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.340]   work backwards from that to say,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.820]   what do I have to do to make that fit?
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.180]   And part of that's getting more productive.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.300]   And then after that doesn't work,
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.800]   it's just reducing what's on your plate.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.840]   And so for me, I keep weekends clear.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.040]   I mean, I have enough, you get enough work stress.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.880]   - Yeah.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.640]   - That I'll still be working on weekends.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.240]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.160]   Let's do some questions.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.000]   We will start here as always with some questions
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.800]   about deep work.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.100]   Coffee up.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.280]   All right, so our first question comes from Alessandro.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.180]   Alessandro asks, what does deliberate practice look like
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.300]   for computer programming?
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.660]   And he goes on to clarify that he finished a master's
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.060]   in applied math.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.740]   He has a junior software developer job
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.660]   and he wants to get better fast.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.260]   All right, so we talk about deliberate practice
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.760]   all the time.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.500]   Quick primer is the best framework we have
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.820]   for understanding how people get better at complex skills,
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.820]   be them physical or intellectual.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.280]   It requires stretch.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.380]   So activity is designed to stretch you
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.880]   past your current comfort point.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.960]   If you're not stretching, you're not gonna improve.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.920]   And then two, it requires feedback.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.680]   Feedback so that you know that whatever you're doing here,
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.920]   the stretch activity you're doing,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.680]   that you're doing it right.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.400]   Right, that you're doing it right and you're doing it well
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   because underneath the hood that is our skull,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.800]   you're really trying to isolate the relevant neural circuit.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.080]   And fire it as cleanly as possible
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.800]   because what fires together wires together.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.640]   So you're gonna get more myelination
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.760]   on those circuit connections if you isolate it.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.660]   So what you wanna be doing is really focusing
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.360]   on doing the thing you wanna do better.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.360]   So you need feedback to make sure
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.440]   that you're doing it right.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.360]   All right, so how do you get that in computer programming?
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.000]   Write real code, right?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.720]   Be doing the thing you wanna get better at.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.840]   So you wanna be writing real code.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.600]   The feedback is really clear in computer programming.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.440]   A, does it compile?
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.280]   And B, if it compiles,
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.720]   does it do the thing it's supposed to do?
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.840]   So you're constantly getting that feedback.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.880]   Rookie mistake we see
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.640]   in the computer science curriculum all the time,
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.040]   I don't really teach programming courses
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.880]   because I'm a theoretician,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.080]   but I hear this from the professors
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.800]   that do teach the skill of programming
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.480]   to computer scientists is that
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.160]   rookie computer programmers often do too much
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.240]   before they test.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.160]   Like in some sense, they say,
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.440]   okay, I'm gonna just try to make this whole thing work
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.360]   and see if it works.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.680]   More adept programmers,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.880]   what they're gonna do is test
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.600]   at the level of their uncertainty.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.680]   So at the very smallest granularity at which
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.520]   I'm not quite sure,
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.000]   I'm not 100% sure that what I did
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.080]   is actually gonna do this,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.880]   then you need to be testing.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.000]   And testing could be as simple
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.320]   as you have print lines in there.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.880]   But if you're doing, let's say some assignment,
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.200]   like I'm gonna use a linked list
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.240]   as part of a program to add polynomials.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.640]   Don't just write the whole program.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.920]   Like, does this work?
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.960]   I gave it a polynomial
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.080]   and another one did to add it properly.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.920]   You should be with little print statements in there,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.480]   testing everything along the way,
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   especially if you're new.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.440]   Does my link list work?
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.160]   Let me just make sure and do a little test there.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.320]   Okay, is it properly storing
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.440]   all the parts of the polynomial?
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.640]   Let me print everything there.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   Okay, is this ad routine being called properly?
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.800]   So you wanna be getting feedback from,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.280]   does the code compile first of all,
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.960]   and two, does it do what I wanna do?
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.040]   But that means you have to have
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.560]   this very small granularity,
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.400]   especially if you're new.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.480]   Just a little bit at a time,
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.800]   make sure it works, do the next thing.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.860]   If you're compiling and praying,
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.120]   or like I wrote a bunch of code,
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.760]   it doesn't compile.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.880]   I'm just gonna randomly change a bunch of stuff
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.800]   and try again and see if it compiles.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.520]   You're not learning, incremental.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.360]   Does it compile?
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.180]   Did it work?
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.680]   All right, let me add one more little thing
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.520]   to what I'm doing here.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.480]   Some new print statements to test it.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.320]   Does it compile?
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.140]   Does it work?
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.920]   That's how you get the feedback.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.240]   And then finally, to get the stretch,
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.640]   whatever you're programming should be hard.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.680]   There's something you're trying to learn how to do.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.480]   So you're actually stretching yourself
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.280]   to do that in the program that you're writing.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.400]   If it's too hard,
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.780]   then you're out of luck.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.760]   If you're new to programming and you say,
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.080]   okay, here's my challenge.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.520]   I wanna write my own Minecraft style voxel engine.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.220]   That's too big of a stretch.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.280]   But if you're kind of new to programming and you say,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.160]   I'm gonna write a, look up in a textbook,
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.640]   a sorting algorithm,
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.600]   and I'm gonna actually implement that sorting algorithm
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.720]   to see if I can sort this array.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.820]   I'm not quite comfortable with looking up algorithms
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:09.960]   and implementing them.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.400]   That's like a very good,
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.280]   that's like a very good healthy stretch.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.400]   All right, so I'm getting a little nerd,
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.020]   I'm getting the nerd weeds here,
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.800]   but Alessandro hopes that helps.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.260]   Write real code, compile and test as your feedback.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.560]   Make sure that code is hard.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.080]   You're doing something you didn't know how to do before,
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:25.980]   but not too hard.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.440]   There's actually, my kids like,
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.520]   some of my kids like Minecraft.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.800]   Jesse, there's a, you probably don't know Minecraft
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   because you're not a 12 year old boy,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.360]   but it has a very complicated graphics engine.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.940]   It's a voxel engine, blah, blah, blah.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.000]   There's these YouTube videos.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.480]   My son was showing me where people see how fast
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.320]   they can build it from scratch.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.680]   So they put the, it's like a screenshot of their computer
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.760]   and they cut through time a lot,
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.740]   but they basically build the game from scratch in a day.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.280]   Yeah, which is, which brings me to my other point.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.520]   I can't help but think what societal good
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.440]   could they be doing instead with that brain?
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.520]   You see somebody could do that.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.340]   You're like, I don't know, man,
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.640]   couldn't you be like working on vaccines
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   or coding up a system to help people find new jobs?
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.440]   Or I often, that's often my thought when I see YouTube
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.880]   is like, that's a smart person
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.120]   with a lot of time on their hands.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.320]   And maybe they should be organizing a food drive
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.920]   at their church or something.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.400]   And yet we're on YouTube.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.980]   So rocks, glass houses, things are shattering.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.920]   All right, let's keep rolling here.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.200]   We got a question from Pythicus.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.520]   Pythicus says, is it rational to quit your job
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.720]   if it implies a potential harm to society?
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.840]   And some pretty hairy details here.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.680]   This is actually a structural engineer.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   Let me see here or whatever.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.880]   He's working, he's supervising a project
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.320]   on building apartment towers.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.560]   And he thinks there's a problem, a design flaw
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.760]   in the towers that under very rare circumstances
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.800]   could be catastrophic.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.280]   And there he's being ignored within his company
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.240]   when he brings this up.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.200]   All right, so let me give you a general
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.440]   and a specific response to this issue.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.880]   In general, in my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   I talk about disqualifiers for a job.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.560]   Things that if they are true is a perfectly valid reason
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.000]   to say I'm gonna go to a new job.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.180]   And the reason why I have those disqualifiers in the book
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.860]   is that a big idea in that book
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.200]   is that we're too quick to switch jobs and to quit.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   We care too much about does this job match my passion?
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.020]   You know, do I love the work every day?
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.060]   And it's an unrealistic and naive view
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.140]   of how people actually craft real meaning in their work.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.140]   And so the book in general discourages
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   very quick job jumping, job switching.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.820]   But I was like, look, there's some clear disqualifiers.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.660]   That means you gotta get out of there.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.260]   And one of those disqualifiers is that
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.900]   the work actively goes against your values.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.100]   Do not stay in a job
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.820]   if it is actually corroding your own values.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.860]   If you think there is something that's happening
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.400]   that's illegal, for sure get out of there.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.460]   If you think there's something that happens
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.920]   that's perfectly legal but is bad for society,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.300]   you gotta get out of there, right?
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.260]   Because that will corrode at your soul
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.720]   if you're doing work that goes against
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   what you think is important.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.660]   Now let's get really specific here.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.940]   Formally registering your complaint
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.740]   all the way up the ladder at the company
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.780]   you really need to do, this is important.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.220]   If that's not working to formally register
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.500]   that complaint outside the company,
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.940]   you're probably ethically obligated to do that as well.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.700]   Basically some whistleblowing behavior.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.020]   Now, I mean, I get the hesitation
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.540]   because you're not quite sure that this is an issue.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.980]   You're actually not, you know, like the head engineer,
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.980]   but you see this could be an issue
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.580]   and you think they're not paying enough attention to it.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.600]   There's probably an ethical obligation here
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.580]   to make sure that the right people
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.760]   who do not have conflicts of interest
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.360]   have all the information you've given them.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.120]   And if even after all of that, people like,
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.880]   I think it's fine, then maybe this issue
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.320]   is not what you think it is, right?
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.920]   But you do, I think in your specific case,
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.080]   have an obligation to not just think about
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.420]   whether or not you wanna leave this company,
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.940]   but make sure that this issue
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.820]   is something that the right people have seen.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.420]   So that's not the easiest thing, Pythicus,
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.260]   but you know, do the hard thing here.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:37.260]   All right, we got a question now moving on from Luke.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.820]   Luke says, when is deep work
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.040]   not the most important personal metric?
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:52.480]   All right, he elaborates in the book, "Decoding Greatness,"
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.660]   Ron Friedman talks about the importance
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.220]   of tracking your important metrics.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.840]   He even quotes you.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.600]   How do I know if hours of deep work
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.800]   is the highest leverage metric for me
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.580]   or something else?
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.820]   Well, it's a good question.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:10.120]   I think a useful bit of terminology
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.480]   when thinking about professional metrics
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.880]   comes from the book,
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.520]   "The Four Disciplines of Execution," 4DX,
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.280]   which I talk about briefly in my book, "Deep Work."
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.080]   And they make a useful distinction,
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.380]   which I've heard other people make as well,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.840]   between what they call lead indicators
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.160]   and lag indicators,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.120]   when it comes to measuring what matters
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.920]   for your work to be more successful.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.560]   Lag indicators are the things in the end
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.600]   you actually care about, right?
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.700]   I mean, this is the thing in the end
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.440]   that you want to actually improve,
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.680]   and it's very specific to the type of work you do.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.720]   The example in 4DX is a supermarket bakery counter
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.560]   or something like this,
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.480]   and the lag indicator was sale numbers.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.840]   In the end, we want sales numbers to go up.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.760]   If you run a podcast,
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.000]   the lag indicator might be downloads,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.440]   you know, how many people are listening to the show,
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.480]   or how many, in writing, how many people buy my book,
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:13.480]   or in, you know, how much units do we sell of this product?
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.220]   It's the thing you actually care about in the end.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.140]   Now, what they talk about,
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.440]   and maybe this is what Friedman's talking about too,
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.460]   is just tracking lag indicators
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.120]   is not enough to actually help you in the moment
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.320]   do the things that matter,
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.520]   because it lags.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.160]   It's not like you can do something today
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.560]   and immediately see its impact
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.000]   on those indicators that matter.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.720]   And so what they argue is you should have lead indicators,
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.120]   things you can track today,
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.040]   and it can influence your behavior today,
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.100]   that if you hit good numbers on those,
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.560]   it will down the line,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.140]   help the lag indicators grow.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.600]   So in the bakery scenario,
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.280]   you want the sales to go up,
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.200]   but the lead indicator might be something like
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.420]   how many customers did we help,
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.120]   or how many different display cases,
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.120]   or did we clean?
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:05.960]   I mean, I don't know about bakery,
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.280]   but stuff you can actually do.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.840]   Deep work is a lead indicator.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.680]   For a lot of jobs,
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.360]   keeping track of how much deep work am I doing
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.760]   is a useful lead indicator,
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.560]   because if deep work is necessary
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.720]   for moving the needle in your job,
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.040]   you need to do it to actually move the needle in your job.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.840]   So it is useful.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.160]   I don't know if I would call it
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.600]   the most important metric though.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.560]   I mean, in this case, two other things matter.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.400]   A, do you have your lag indicators right,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.960]   and are you looking at them?
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.920]   If you're just doing deep work
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.660]   for the sake of doing deep work, meaningless.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.720]   You gotta know the needle you're trying to move in the end.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.600]   You gotta be watching that needle to see if it's moving.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.640]   And that needle is not moving,
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.080]   even though you're doing a lot of deep work,
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.360]   then two, you have to care about
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.480]   what deep work am I doing?
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.240]   Like what is the right type of deep work
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.720]   that's gonna move the needle on this particular thing
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.840]   that I care about on this particular lag indicator?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.720]   So don't get too obsessive about just,
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.320]   here's my deep work tally.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.720]   I got six hours this week.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.840]   That's an important tally to do,
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.280]   but only if you know what you're doing
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.320]   during those deep work hours,
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.760]   and it's tied to a very specific longer term goal
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.860]   that you're keeping a very careful eye on.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:20.080]   All right, so let's do another question here.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.340]   We got one from Jeffrey.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.120]   Jeffrey says, "Should I stay at a job
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.000]   where the management actively tries to stifle productivity?"
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.020]   Context is important here.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.300]   Looking at the elaboration,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.040]   Jesse, or Jeffrey, not Jesse.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.280]   Jeffrey has been at this job for eight years.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.880]   I don't wanna just think about that.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.300]   That would be funny if this was a question from Jesse,
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.360]   and it was Jesse being like,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.160]   how do I get out of a position
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.000]   where my manager is so unproductive
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.280]   and makes me unproductive?
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.880]   And it was just like a passive aggressive way
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.880]   of getting back at me,
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.480]   and it turns out like I'm a terrible boss
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.080]   that's like really chaotic and disorganized.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.520]   All right, all right, Jeffrey.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.840]   You've worked there for eight years.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   They manipulate, your managers manipulate your workloads
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.540]   by assigning them at random times
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.120]   that are very disadvantageous,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.680]   like Friday afternoons or afternoons
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.440]   before I leave to take the day off.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.520]   It's good paying benefits,
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.840]   but he's getting frustrated because it's our fault.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.920]   I mean, we have been infecting poor Jeffrey here
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.800]   with visions of how knowledge work can actually unfold,
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.320]   ways that's not overloaded,
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.400]   ways that's not stressful,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.800]   ways in which you are in control of your time,
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.200]   and you're moving the needle and getting things done,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.880]   but on your own terms, you're not overworked,
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.760]   you're not overstressed.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.440]   And he's learned that that's all possible,
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   and he turns around and his boss is like,
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.080]   I'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.440]   We're in Lumberg territory.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.040]   It's an office space reference.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.320]   All right, what do we do about this?
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.000]   Jeffrey, here's what I'm gonna suggest.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.960]   Don't leave your job right away,
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.760]   but I'm gonna make you more rigid.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.040]   I'll explain how in a second.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   If that blows up, if the Lumberg in your life says,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.620]   no way, I said I need this tomorrow, get it done,
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.360]   then you start looking somewhere else,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.120]   and you can be confident that it was a good thing to do.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.320]   So here's what I mean by getting more rigid.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.680]   Get your systems in place,
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.160]   and enforce them, enforce them.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.040]   So like in this case, you need a system,
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.960]   and this is something I've been working on recently
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.240]   in some of my thinking that I haven't published a lot yet.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.880]   So I'm giving you some ideas that are hot off the presses.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   I'm a big believer in this external work system approach,
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.560]   where instead of just in knowledge work,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.360]   thinking about all things that need to be done
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.360]   as existing on individual people's plates.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.480]   We just throw these around on the people's plates.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.280]   Jeffrey, do this, now it's on your plate,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.200]   and I'll have to worry about it.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.580]   You know, hey, Jesse, you do this, now it's on your plate,
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.200]   I don't have to worry about it.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.000]   I'm a big believer in having an external system
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.700]   into which work that needs to get done goes,
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.800]   and that people then pull work out of that external system
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.960]   as they have the appropriate time to do it.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.880]   I think this is actually probably the right structure
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.480]   for work assignment in most knowledge work scenarios.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.480]   A good external system has a few things to it.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.120]   One, a good filter.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.080]   So it's really clear, like here's the different type of work
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.120]   that could come into the system,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.740]   and it has to go through these properly shaped portals,
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.120]   and if your work doesn't fit, then it doesn't go in.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.260]   So you're making the person assigning the work do more work.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.120]   Two, there's a real organizational ethic
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.080]   inside of the system,
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.760]   how the work gets organized and prioritized,
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.240]   that's thoughtful.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   And three, status is really clear to anyone who cares.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.440]   All right, this thing I put into the external system,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.680]   it's been organized, no one's working on it yet,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.240]   but it has, you know,
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.200]   it's relatively high on the priority list,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.960]   probably someone will get to it in the next two weeks.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.800]   I think in the end,
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.080]   that's what most knowledge work organizations need.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.060]   Now, Jeffrey, they're not gonna do this,
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.320]   so I want you to simulate this with yourself.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.200]   I want you to basically imagine
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.240]   that you have an external system you can control
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.920]   where work comes in through these holes,
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.720]   it gets organized, if it doesn't fit,
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.800]   then it can't come in,
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.000]   and clear status is given to the people who care about it.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.200]   And then there's what you're actually working on
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   this week and this day,
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.600]   and you work on a reasonable amount of stuff
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.440]   till it's done,
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.400]   and then you pull more stuff out of this system.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.840]   And how do you simulate something like this?
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.280]   I mean, I'm still working out the details,
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.200]   but a few different things.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.920]   So how do you simulate that clear filter on what comes in?
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.720]   Well, someone puts something on your plate
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.920]   that is half-baked,
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.220]   and they don't give you all the information,
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.000]   and they're just playing obligation hot potato
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.340]   and just trying to get it off their plate
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.360]   because it's on their head,
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.960]   and they don't want it to be on their head.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.400]   You say something like,
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.020]   all right, I'm happy to take this on board,
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.780]   this is the information I'll need, right?
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.080]   That's back to them.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.380]   So they'll have to give you and get you that information.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.800]   If you really wanna push it here,
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.120]   you can involve processes here.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.360]   You can say, I'm happy to take this on board.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.860]   There's a bunch of questions
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.980]   that would need to be resolved for me
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.680]   to really understand what you need here.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.520]   Please, I have these clear office hours.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.800]   So whenever it's convenient for you,
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.560]   you just jump on one of these, here they are,
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.240]   and I'll get from you all the information I need.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.360]   Or here's my Calendly, take a 30-minute slot,
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.400]   and that's where I'll get all the information I need.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.400]   So now you are having these carefully shaped portholes
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.740]   in which information could come in,
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.160]   that if it doesn't have everything you need,
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.080]   it's not coming in the system.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.760]   None of this like, hey, Jeffrey,
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.000]   can you see what we need to get this client's
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.040]   reimbursement up to date or something?
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.160]   Like, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.680]   Let's figure out exactly what that means.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   And you can use processes and systems there.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.080]   Two, okay, once they're in the system,
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.320]   make its status really clear to people.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.080]   All right, I've taken this into my queue,
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.140]   I'm looking at my queue now,
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.520]   and there's like three or four things ahead of this.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.480]   So my best guess is probably it'll be a week from now
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.400]   before I can get to it without changing priorities
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.240]   on the queue.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.680]   Now, this means you gotta have this information
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   really well put together.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.160]   You gotta have, you know,
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.000]   a keeping track of everything, what I'm working on.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.920]   I mean, you gotta have your act together, Jeffrey,
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.420]   if you're gonna pull this off.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.160]   But you're giving them that good status update.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.880]   And then from an organizational perspective,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.640]   you're keeping it really clear, all the things,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.080]   all the information, their status,
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.160]   use a Trello board for this.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.960]   Like here's the stuff that I have all the information,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.560]   here's the stuff I'm waiting to hear back on,
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.840]   here's the relative priority.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.720]   And you gotta be very careful
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.240]   in your weekly and daily planning
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.640]   to be pulling things from this list
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.880]   and actually getting the things done and being reliable.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.960]   They can depend on you.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   You can get idiosyncratic credits,
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.200]   idiosyncrasy credits, that's the term.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.840]   It's an Adam Grant term.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.020]   You can get those credits,
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.960]   the ability to do things weird if you actually deliver.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.000]   If you don't deliver that you get no leeway.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.440]   And then actually, there it is,
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.280]   the stuff's in my system,
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.560]   I pull out what's reasonable for the week.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.920]   They don't have the option anymore
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.960]   of saying it's Friday afternoon,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.700]   get this done by Saturday morning.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.420]   And if they wanna push back, they can push back,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.800]   but they have to push back on your system.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.560]   And they have to say,
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.160]   I don't wanna have to give you that information.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.520]   If they say, no, I want this, whatever,
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.000]   you're like, okay, but let me just tell you,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.320]   these are the things that have to get moved
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.040]   to lower priority, right?
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.400]   They have to confront how much time
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.480]   you actually have available.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.560]   One of two things will happen.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.880]   One, they will say, Jeffrey's great,
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.400]   he's been here eight years, he delivers, he's awesome,
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.600]   we don't wanna lose him.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.800]   I really just wanted clarity anyways, right?
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.680]   I mean, I, and here I'm simulating the boss.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.160]   I'm really disorganized, I hate having things in my head.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.220]   I throw things on your plate as soon as I think about them
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.780]   because I don't wanna have to worry about them.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.880]   So long as I know I can trust you,
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.840]   oh, it's in your system, you have the information,
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.100]   it's gonna happen in two weeks and fine.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.080]   I don't have to think about it, you do you.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.080]   Or they say, no, no, no, no, like forget that.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.960]   You need to just respond to me
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.100]   and do everything right when I say it.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.840]   And then you, Jeffrey, you have the information you need
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.560]   that it's time to find a different position.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.580]   It might be quitting that job,
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.640]   it might be changing your position within that company
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.760]   so that you're much more independent
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.920]   when you're trading performance for freedom.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.000]   All right, I'm gonna be more like a consultant,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.120]   pay me by my performance, but you can't bother me,
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.360]   whatever you need to do.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.840]   But give that a try, give the external system a try.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.160]   You might be surprised how much they'll put up with.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.440]   All right, let's see here.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.440]   We got time for one more question.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.800]   Let me do one more quick, deep work question.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.960]   This one comes from Sammy.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.980]   Sammy says, what are your tips
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:56.900]   for a mother of two small kids doing master's?
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.760]   Well, I mean, first of all,
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.040]   the fact that you have two small kids
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.360]   doing master's degrees tells me
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.000]   that you've got some pretty amazing genes,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.240]   so congratulations.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.680]   I was trying to explain to my oldest son, who's nine,
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.520]   the plot of "Doogie Howser, M.D."
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.760]   which was a show that was popular
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.300]   when Jesse and I were kids.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.160]   It did not compute.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.560]   He was like, wait a second.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.280]   There's so many questions, and you know what?
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.380]   It didn't compute not because he couldn't understand it,
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.200]   but because there are a lot of questions
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.000]   about "Doogie Howser, M.D."
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.780]   and the fact that this 12-year-old
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.880]   was being licensed to do practice clinical medicine
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.720]   in emergency rooms.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.440]   There's a lot of questions about that show,
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.480]   but that's what I think about
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.880]   when I think about two small kids doing master's degrees.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.000]   There was, Jesse, there was at,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.060]   and I don't mean to go on the side,
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.160]   but MIT had some of this stuff going on, right?
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   Like MIT CS program gets some
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.880]   pretty interesting, weird brains,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   but there was a kid when I started my PhD program,
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.400]   who was another incoming computer science student,
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.400]   and he was 14, maybe, 15, maybe,
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.840]   maybe 16, but I think like 15 years old.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.960]   He had not only finished his undergraduate degree
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.440]   in computer science from University of Washington,
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.280]   which is a great program,
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.160]   he had gone and worked at Microsoft for a while,
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.120]   and was bored.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.560]   It's like, I gotta go get a PhD.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.440]   So he had been in the workforce for a while
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.760]   before he came back to get his PhD,
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.640]   and he was like 15 years old.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.560]   So, so it was a strange place.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.440]   - Did you talk to him a lot?
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.440]   - He was a systems guy, so I didn't know him well,
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.000]   but, and I don't think he actually stayed for his PhD.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.400]   The problem with PhD programs like at MIT
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.720]   is the entire time you're there,
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.520]   there's like literally people, not literally, okay,
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.480]   so the opposite of literally,
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.520]   but there's people knocking at your doors
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.120]   with wheelbarrows full of money.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.800]   In reality, it's emails from headhunters, et cetera,
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.280]   but basically, here is a wheelbarrow full of money.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.520]   If you follow me to a job,
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.640]   and they pick a lot of people off,
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.680]   you'll just get things from headhunters,
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.000]   like we will, starting salary, $450,000,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.240]   let's rock and roll, come to my quant fund or whatever.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.160]   So you lose a lot of people,
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.360]   they'll get their masters along the way,
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.200]   and then they're out the door.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.960]   So it's only us suckers that actually stick it out
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.480]   all the way and become low paid professors.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.200]   All right, Sammy, I'm sorry,
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.600]   I'm completely off your question now.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.800]   All right, I was making fun of your ambiguous wording.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.640]   Sorry about that.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.760]   So let's start this again.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.720]   Sammy says, "What are your tips for a mother
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.600]   of two small kids doing masters?"
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.520]   All right, it's a, what is that, like a dangling modifier?
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.120]   It's the mother, not the children's doing the masters.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.640]   All right, we get that.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.280]   "How can she find focus time in the midst of being a wife
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.200]   and a mother?"
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.400]   That's good ages, nine-year-old and a three-year-old.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.200]   I have one of each and a seven-year-old in between,
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.880]   so I empathize.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.320]   Sammy, two things.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.080]   One, acknowledge it's a really hard thing
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.240]   you wanna do right now.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.000]   So it's important that you don't come into this
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.560]   with a psychology of, "Oh, I should just be able to do this.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.480]   No big deal.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.680]   Let's just rock and roll.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.520]   I bought a bullet journal, we're good.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   Let's just go after it.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520]   I read Lean In."
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.120]   That's really hard.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.400]   If you're, those are hard ages.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.480]   The nine-year-old is probably in school,
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.640]   but the three-year-old might not be.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.080]   So that's hard, acknowledge that.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.440]   Think about it like you told people,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.760]   "I'm gonna run a marathon."
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.960]   We're like, "Oh, that's so hard."
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.040]   And like, that's how you think about it.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.640]   Don't think about this as an easy thing to do, it's not.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.560]   So I don't want you to feel bad about this being hard.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.640]   Two, in those situations,
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   you need to autopilot all the work.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.440]   And by autopilot, this is my terminology.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   This goes way back to the early days of my writing
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.560]   on my website for students.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   But autopilot schedules was where
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.160]   all of the work that needs to be done,
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.040]   you figure out in advance.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.320]   This is where it always gets done,
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.400]   when it always gets done.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   You can't, in this situation, succeed by just saying,
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.440]   "Oh, what's due tomorrow?
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.800]   Oh, I gotta do some readings and write a paper.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.280]   Let me go get that work done."
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.120]   That barely works for 19-year-olds
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.040]   who are living in a dorm and only doing school.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.720]   It's not gonna work for a mother of two children.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.640]   So you gotta just figure out,
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.440]   like, this is when my reading gets done.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.600]   All right, I dropped a three-year-old off at daycare
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.720]   and I have this two-hour window,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.080]   and that's always when I do my reading
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.440]   for the English class.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.760]   And Sunday afternoons is for paper writing.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.320]   So every other Sunday I work on papers.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.640]   Like, you really gotta not be thinking at all
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.720]   about what should I be doing today.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.920]   Autopilot that all out.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.040]   Figure out how much time you need,
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.760]   what work you have to do when it gets done.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.480]   So you can be really optimal about this
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.200]   and really be smart about where you try to fit that time.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.120]   If it still doesn't fit, which it might not,
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.420]   then you have to slow down.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.680]   You have to slow down the program.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.800]   You have to find a way to do it on a longer timeline.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.400]   Face the productivity dragon,
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.360]   but if the dragon is too big, don't charge into the cave.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.360]   That's a great thing about autopilot scheduling
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.400]   is you get to stare it in the face and say,
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.900]   "Can I make this work?"
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:14.400]   And if you can, this autopilot schedule
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.480]   is gonna give you the best possible chance
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.320]   of making it work.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.640]   And if you can't, you say, "Okay, what can I make work?"
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.500]   And you adjust what you're doing until it fits.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:30.120]   All right, I think that's good for questions on deep work.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.080]   Looking at our time now, running long, that's okay.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.760]   Let's do a few questions on the deep life.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:40.940]   All right, we got a question from Sarah.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.240]   Oh, another parent question.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.680]   Sarah says, "Do you view raising children
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.560]   as something that can be part of the deep life
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.440]   or something that is mostly an obstacle to the deep life,
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.380]   though valuable in a different way?"
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.360]   So Sarah, when I think about the deep life,
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.800]   as you know from the show,
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.200]   I often think it's useful to break up
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.140]   the aspects of your life in the different areas
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.560]   that for historical reasons on this show,
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.400]   we call buckets,
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.060]   even though that might not be the best terminology.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.400]   And what you really wanna make sure
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.840]   is that in each of these buckets,
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.400]   each of these areas that's important,
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.860]   you're putting energy,
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:23.280]   real energy into things that are really important,
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.640]   things that are really important in that bucket
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.080]   and not wasting too much energy on things that are not.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.360]   One of those buckets that's probably, I would say,
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.060]   the most important bucket is what I often call community,
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.060]   but community is family, friends,
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.940]   and the people around you.
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.520]   That's the key one.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.480]   I mean, I've said this before on the show.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.300]   If you neglect that one, the other ones don't matter.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.120]   Like you might be okay for a while
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.840]   neglecting what's in that community bucket,
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.440]   neglecting family, neglecting friends,
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.680]   neglecting the people around you,
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.880]   but you have no resilience.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.840]   And when you hit hard times, that bottom is gonna fall
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.120]   and you are gonna plummet.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.600]   Homo sapiens are very social beings.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.400]   Sacrificing on behalf, time and energy on behalf of others
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:12.620]   that are important to us is at the absolute foundation
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:13.820]   to living a deep life.
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.740]   So no, it's not an obstacle to the deep life.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.960]   It's a bucket you have to take care of first
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   before you think about the craft bucket, for example,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.200]   where your work might be,
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.480]   or before you think about the constitution bucket,
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:33.100]   where exercise and fitness and health might be, for example.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.560]   Now, the reason why I think this is an important question
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:41.040]   is you know that, so I think the issue is
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.300]   there's a semantic thing we should clarify.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.880]   So when you say valuable in a different way,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.380]   I think what's happening here is that you are
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.740]   defining the deep life too narrowly.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:56.140]   You're probably thinking of the deep life as meaning
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.080]   I do deep work in my job.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.980]   And so a deep life does a lot of that.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.320]   And anything else that gets in the way of that
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.460]   is an obstacle to that.
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:07.680]   That is not the deep life.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.940]   And this is why I actually introduced
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:09.900]   the notion of the deep life,
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.760]   which I coined the term in March of 2020.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.500]   The historians among you will look at your calendars
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.940]   and realize there were some important things happening
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:19.880]   during that month.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:22.260]   And the whole point of actually coining the term
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:26.000]   the deep life and starting that thinking in March of 2020
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.440]   was to make sure that we were considering
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.340]   the whole picture of what matters in life.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.380]   That was a time period, at least that month,
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.000]   where people did not care much
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.980]   about exactly how much deep work
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.420]   they were doing on their job.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:43.460]   Because if you're in the type of job that you do deep work,
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.620]   what you really were doing was being on Zoom all day
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.420]   and just panicking.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.660]   So it was a time period where we said,
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.940]   okay, the whole life matters,
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:53.540]   this disruption makes that clear.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.500]   If you do not have all of the buckets firing,
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.100]   what happens when there's huge disruption?
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.080]   Your bottom falls out, you plummet,
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.580]   we don't want that to happen again.
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:02.840]   All parts of the deep life matter.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.820]   So no, your kids are critical to it.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:09.060]   My whole professional life is built in part
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:12.060]   around making sure that that bucket of my deep life
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.060]   is serviced.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:17.120]   It's why, I mean, I do the work I do.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.220]   It's why I really prioritize,
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.420]   and I built my entire career trajectory around this,
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.800]   autonomy and flexibility, control over my time.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.020]   I wanna be, on the short scale, I wanna be able to,
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.220]   though I can't do it every day,
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:32.800]   have days where I'm just take the whole afternoon off
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.840]   and I pick the kids up and spend time with them.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.420]   I wanna be able to take them to their practices.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.140]   On the bigger scale, I wanna take summers really quietly.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.140]   I wanna just be around.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.260]   I wanna have long breaks.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.820]   The academic life gives you long breaks.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.860]   The writing life gives you full autonomy.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:52.020]   I'm really big on having huge flexibility and seasonality,
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.220]   busy periods and not busy periods,
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.580]   so I can be around and deeply ingrained in my kids' life.
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:57.760]   We decided where we moved.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.120]   We're in Tacoma Park because a family is the right place
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.300]   to raise a family, et cetera.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.580]   So Sarah, that's all to say, no,
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.440]   your kids are key to your definition of the deep life.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.740]   But you gotta look at all the buckets
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.580]   and then come up with a configuration of life
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.780]   that serves all of them.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.380]   All right, good question.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.540]   We got a question here from Coach Pete.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:21.340]   Coach Pete says, "Is listening to audio books
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:25.980]   "just as beneficial as reading actual hard copy books?"
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.900]   Yeah, just read a lot, read a wide variety,
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.720]   use a lot of formats.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.560]   It's all good.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.620]   It's all good.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:39.620]   I just think reading is calisthenics for your brain.
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.740]   It opens up your brain.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:44.820]   It's also the source of raw ideas and vocabulary
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.860]   and even argument structure.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:49.460]   It is the grist that you then chew up in your brain
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.980]   to make that brain way more effective.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.620]   So I just say read as much as you can
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.440]   and don't sweat the details.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.900]   This is why you'll see, for example,
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.900]   when I do my monthly report on the books I read
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.160]   that I'm all over the place.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.980]   I read a huge variety of different topics
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.820]   and I don't care.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.220]   I just, let's go, let's read.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.460]   You know, let's just have it going.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.300]   And I think it's the same thing
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.940]   as if you wanna just be generally in shape,
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.060]   do a bunch of different things.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.140]   Bike, I row, I lift weights, I do calisthenics,
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.380]   I do some CrossFit, I'm playing on an Ultimate Frisbee team.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.180]   You just throw a bunch of stuff at it.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.080]   It's good for you.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:27.540]   All right, we've got a question here from Jacob.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.100]   Jacob asks, "How do I realistically accomplish
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.700]   "a digital detox when all of my leisure
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.180]   "is currently spent on technology?
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.700]   "I am currently an online student
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.260]   "and I spend all of my vast amounts
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.660]   "of leisure time on my phone.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.100]   "I really wanna do a digital detox,
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.940]   "but I believe it might be too drastic and unsustainable."
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.860]   So Jacob, read my book, "Digital Minimalism,"
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.660]   where I really walk through how to do this.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.940]   Two points here.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.300]   One, I do not use the terminology digital detox.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:01.180]   That term has been appropriated by people
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.300]   in the digital space in what I believe
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.620]   to be an inappropriate way.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.820]   They took this term that's most heavily used
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.620]   in substance abuse and they completely changed it
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.900]   to be the opposite of its original use,
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.580]   its original intention, so I don't like it.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.780]   So if you look in the substance abuse community,
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.820]   what is a detox?
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.620]   Well, you're literally trying to eliminate
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.740]   the chemical dependence on the substance
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.620]   and doing it under a controlled circumstance.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.980]   So you're at a detox center,
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.580]   so there is no alcohol there,
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.580]   and there's people there who can watch
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.500]   to make sure that from a health perspective
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.580]   that you're okay, so that's part of it.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.860]   But the second part of it,
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.800]   and it's the part that makes the whole thing make sense,
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.740]   is that you also then re-engineer your life
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:50.980]   during this process so that when you come out of it,
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.940]   you no longer have that relationship
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.300]   with the substance that caused the problem
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.300]   in the first place.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:59.020]   You would not run a very successful,
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.540]   let's say, alcohol detox center
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:01.540]   if you say, "Here's our plan.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.900]   "You come here, you spend the month,
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.080]   "it's really hard, you get the DTs,
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.480]   "trying to get off your alcohol dependency,
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.460]   "you white-knuckle it, we get you off of it,
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.920]   "and then on day 31, we all go to the bar
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.380]   "to celebrate you doing it."
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.140]   No, you build a whole life without alcohol,
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.460]   and yet in the digital community,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.580]   they have taken this term and they apply it
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.340]   to mean exactly that.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.940]   Like, yeah, let's take a break
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.520]   from these technologies that we feel like
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.980]   are ruining our lives before going back
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.380]   to using them as before.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.820]   That is the opposite of the intention of a detox,
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.940]   so I do not like that term.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.220]   So I introduced a new term in my book, declutter,
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.300]   digital declutter.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.980]   And you spend 30 days away
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.820]   from all these optional technologies
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.340]   with the goal of completely rebuilding
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.300]   your digital life from scratch when you're done
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.700]   so that it's something that is sustainable
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.640]   and a source of good, not bad.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.260]   So no detox, declutter.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.800]   Read the book, and I walk through how to actually do it.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.400]   The key thing you're gonna see is that
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.060]   if this is gonna work, you have to aggressively fill
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.060]   the newly free time with experimentation and reflection.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.480]   You have to actually go do lots of other activities,
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.040]   learn new things, try new things.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.060]   You have to join things and go places.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.300]   You have to spend a lot of time alone
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.080]   with your own thoughts and reading.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.480]   Active, active, active.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.240]   That is the key, Jacob, is you replace
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.320]   what you're doing before with things that are better.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.140]   You get much more insight about what matters to you,
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.900]   what you find important, what real pleasure feels like
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.880]   versus superficial dopamine hacking
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.940]   that these devices are doing.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.420]   And then when you're done with those 30 days,
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.180]   you rebuild your life from scratch.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:42.820]   Read "Digital Minimalism," chapter three, I believe,
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.820]   will walk you through exactly how to do it.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.660]   And I gotta say, Jacob, you need to do it.
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.340]   You are spending, and I'm quoting you,
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.480]   "vast amounts of leisure time on your phone."
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.680]   That is a simulacrum of a real life.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.640]   You, my friend, are in the matrix,
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.000]   but if they were running the matrix
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.500]   off a kind of sucky computer,
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.840]   you're in like an Apple IIe matrix
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.240]   where it's not only like a simulation of life,
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.360]   but a pretty bad simulation,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.880]   pretty impoverished simulation of life.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.960]   You don't even know the feelings of deeper satisfaction
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.800]   you could be experiencing.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.480]   You don't even know the sense of competency
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.400]   and awe and gratitude that you could be feeling.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.500]   You don't even know what's possible professionally
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.020]   with building skills and crafts
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.980]   and seeing your intentions in your brain
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.300]   be made manifest concretely in the world,
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.340]   the quiet satisfactions that provide,
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.900]   the non-trivial sacrificing of time and attention
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.660]   on behalf of people that you really care about.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.340]   There is a depth and a resilience that is possible in life.
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.860]   It makes life not only worth living,
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.380]   but allows you to go through the ups and the downs
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.460]   with your head held high
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.240]   and still doing good in the world.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.660]   All of that is possible
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.260]   once you stop spending your vast amount
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.600]   of leisure time just looking at your phone.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.240]   You are clocking in right now into a factory, my friend,
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.380]   a factory that is being run
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.060]   by a small number of social media companies.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.120]   And you're doing long shifts,
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.940]   producing stuff for them that's valuable for them.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.320]   And you're doing it for free
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.660]   and you're doing it at the sacrifice
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.760]   of the stuff that really matters in your life.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.360]   Quit that virtual job in the Instagram factory
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.640]   and let's build a deeper life.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.840]   And this podcast will help you do it.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.520]   Look at my episodes about the deep life, keep listening,
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.960]   but I want you to get better.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.500]   All right, we got time here for,
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.100]   we'll do two more quick deep life questions.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.500]   So we have one here from Charles.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:33.420]   Charles says, how can high school students excel
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:35.700]   in this new age without SATs?
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:39.100]   Well, Ben, focus on your grades.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.500]   I mean, the academic formula has always been grades
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.460]   plus SAT scores for the vast majority of colleges.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.500]   Basically the only thing that matters is your grades
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.600]   and SAT scores, if they're where they need to be,
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.760]   you get in, if they're not, you don't.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.880]   So now you're just doing grades
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.040]   instead of grades plus SAT scores.
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.280]   If you're in one of the very narrow group of people
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.020]   who's applying to a college that is selective enough
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.480]   that grades alone are not gonna be enough
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.440]   to determine if you get in
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.120]   and they're gonna look at other aspects of your life
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.480]   and your activities,
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.000]   read my book, "How to Become a High School Superstar."
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.880]   I get into how to do that game sustainably.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.400]   How to make yourself impressive
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.500]   as a college admissions officers
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:23.020]   without living a overworked, miserable grind life.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.100]   It's a cool book.
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.140]   I profile a bunch of students I call relaxed superstars
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:29.420]   who got into good schools without stressing out
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:30.900]   and I deconstruct how they do it.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.180]   So you'll like that book.
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.300]   But again, for the most part,
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.700]   for 95% of the people, get good grades.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:41.340]   All right, final question here comes from Helen.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:43.580]   Helen says, can you talk about the dangers of social media
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:47.300]   in two particular contexts, stalkers
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.920]   and people who put their jobs at risk
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.380]   by silly things they post?
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.760]   Both of these are real issues.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:55.600]   Helen, these are good.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.880]   I'm glad you brought these up.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.680]   There's lots of issues that come with
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.280]   having a kind of constant interactive interaction
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.960]   with basically the entire world
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.040]   in a wide scale platform with a homogenized interface.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.000]   So everyone just looks the same to everyone else.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.840]   Yeah, stalkers are a big deal.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.980]   You get weird.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.080]   Sometimes it's just trolls,
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.040]   but sometimes it can be more scary than that.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.440]   Tim Ferriss have talked about this.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.900]   Tim Ferriss has huge issues with this.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.740]   People find him, they look up his address
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.800]   and real estate records.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.320]   They crazy people get obsessed with them.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.920]   But yeah, there's a cost to putting yourself out there.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.960]   Now, Tim Ferriss is very famous,
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.720]   but why expose yourself to those costs?
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.220]   Especially if you don't get the,
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.360]   whatever the fame and fortune that comes with that fame.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.200]   Social media just allows you to expose yourself
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.060]   to this type of issues without the reward.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:43.560]   And then people who put their jobs at risk.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.080]   Yes, it's a big source of stress.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.280]   That's a big source of stress.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.240]   You hear these stories because they get captured
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.960]   and amplified and spread of individuals
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.880]   that said the wrong thing, whatever.
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.360]   It was a joke that landed flat or was taken out of context
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.660]   or they weren't at their best and then their job is gone.
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.400]   Yes, there's a fear of that happening to you,
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.660]   but way more pervasive is the fear.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.060]   I mean, that could actually happen,
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.760]   but the fear that that could happen
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.240]   is just gonna pervade your life
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.880]   if you've decided that I'm gonna just post
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.480]   a lot of things on social media.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:26.360]   I do not understand this cultural belief we had.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.800]   It's something I've really pushed back on a lot.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.800]   They're like, everyone has to be
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.040]   on these platforms using them.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.520]   They don't, and most people shouldn't be.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.440]   Most people should not be on Facebook or Twitter
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.480]   or whatever sharing their thoughts about everything.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.980]   I mean, I know it presses some buttons,
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.820]   but people don't care.
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:41.660]   They're not following you.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.920]   They don't really care,
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.900]   but you're giving yourself all these stresses
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.660]   by being out there in the public eye.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.780]   I mean, I'm barely in the public eye
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.720]   and there's like 80% of it I hate.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.200]   Why would you wanna do this voluntarily?
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.960]   I mean, this video camera
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.200]   makes me a little bit uncomfortable.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.600]   I'm like somewhat uncomfortable
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.980]   with people knowing what I look like.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.160]   I'm an academic writer.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.520]   I like books to come out.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.060]   Now, I thought this was important
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.880]   because this information's important
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   and it has to be broken up into whatever.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.760]   I mean, we've talked about this whole thing,
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.320]   but why bring this upon yourself,
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.380]   the stress of weirdos that can now follow me,
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.940]   the stress of what if I say something wrong
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:17.780]   and I get fired?
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.260]   And again, whether or not that's actually gonna happen,
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.100]   doesn't matter.
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.620]   The fear is causing issues in your life.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.660]   And there's other things, Helen,
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.940]   that you're not mentioning here that can be just as bad.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.140]   The stress of seeing someone say something negative
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.500]   about you or what you said.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.960]   We're not wired to handle that.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.500]   We're wired to take that very seriously
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.000]   because historically when someone is saying,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.520]   you're terrible, it was someone in our tribe
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.460]   and it meant that we were probably doing something terrible.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.800]   Now it's just sport on Twitter,
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.460]   but why expose yourself to that?
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.900]   This cultural idea that you have to be on social media
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.580]   and it's weird if you're not, I think it's just crazy.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.780]   I think social media should be a thing
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.620]   that for some people has a very clear use.
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.900]   But it's not a universal.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.840]   It's not like if you're not on Twitter,
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.540]   it's deciding to ride a horse instead of driving a car
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:08.140]   or you don't own a television.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.780]   I think it should be way more narrow than that.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.300]   Most people don't need to be on there.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.620]   Most people, at least posting on there,
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:16.140]   most people's life would be significantly less stressful
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.700]   if they weren't for all these types of reasons.
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.660]   There's a lot of negative externalities
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.300]   to interactive social media use.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.340]   And Helen, you were right to bring this up
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.460]   'cause it's yet another reason
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:28.060]   why we should be way more careful about these technologies
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.580]   and be way more suspicious
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.880]   about the current cultural climate
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.300]   that at least until a minute ago,
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.660]   basically made it seem like if you were not
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.300]   on all these platforms sharing your thoughts with the world,
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:43.380]   that somehow there was something wrong about you.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.940]   Being in the public eye is a weird place to be.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.820]   It's a fraught place to be.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.260]   Don't throw yourself into that for no other reason
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:54.380]   than just people thought it would be cool to have that at.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.260]   All right, well, that's all the time
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.020]   we have for this episode.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:00.860]   Thanks for watching.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.700]   Thank you everyone who sent in their questions.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.340]   If you like what you heard,
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.460]   you will like what you read.

[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:11.700]   We'll be back on Thursday with a listener calls episode.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.740]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:18.060]   (upbeat music)
