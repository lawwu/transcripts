[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740]   The reason why having your number out there is a problem is because, if you think about
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.940]   it, most people who use multi-factor authentication, the second factor tends to be a code sent
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.980]   to their phone number.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.740]   If your phone number is stolen as a result of a SIM swap, which is not as difficult as
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.020]   one would think, for a few bucks, unfortunately, people call people at mobile providers and
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.740]   get them to switch things based on the fact that they go, "I'm sorry.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.860]   I forgot my password.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.780]   This is my phone number, and I just got a new device, by the way, so can you please
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.300]   transfer to my new device?"
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.580]   And then, all of a sudden, you don't get the code.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.540]   We've had cases where people have lost millions in cryptocurrency because the code was sent
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.260]   to the phone number that had been stolen by a hacker.
