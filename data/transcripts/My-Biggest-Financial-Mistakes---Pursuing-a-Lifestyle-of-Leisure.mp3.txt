[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Welcome to radical personal finance a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge skills insights and encouragement
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.820]   You need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.280]   My name is Joshua sheets today. I'm going to continue this series
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.040]   called my biggest financial mistakes my biggest financial mistakes again, I've
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.200]   Done a lot of introspection and analysis over the past six to twelve months in my own life, and I've made a list
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.640]   It's quite long of my personal biggest financial mistakes the things that have cost me more money than
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.360]   anything else and
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.680]   I've been sharing those with you little by little and in no particular order just in the order that I feel like I want to
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.920]   talk about them
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   and today's
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   Mistake is is actually quite simple. It is simply this
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.880]   One of my biggest financial mistakes has been
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.160]   having a selfish focus on
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.400]   myself and my own lifestyle goals
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.400]   Rather than being willing to focus on
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.240]   serving others I
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.360]   Think here a little bit of background will help you to understand this. I
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.640]   Could have also titled this particular podcast
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.080]   Episode how I feel like I've been bamboozled by the financial independence movement
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.360]   Because it's taken me
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.560]   Quite a while to work through and experience enough to be sure of what I'm actually saying to you
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.200]   by way of background
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.240]   When I was younger I
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.920]   Wanted to be financially independent I wanted to be financially free and
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.360]   I spent time reading things and listening to people who promised financial freedom
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.760]   Who promised that I would be able to achieve my goals?
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.960]   I read personal finance literature and personal finance literature taught me that if I would put money in my IRAs and
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.320]   contribute faithfully and invested into stocks that someday I would be a
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   Wealthy millionaire and have a lot of money and then I would be able to retire I read
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.120]   and listened to
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.160]   literature and things that that people talked about that helped me to have that goal of financial independence and while I've
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.320]   personally made fun of and pilloried for many years the
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.120]   scam of retirement
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.360]   The reality is it affected me deeply
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.520]   The idea that even though I made fun of it right the Merrill Lynch ad with the gray-haired couple walking calmly down the beach
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.000]   I made fun of it. I still it was still held in my mind as a vision
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.560]   something that I wanted and
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.720]   as I worked my way through the world of employment, I
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.080]   Systematically grew to want it more I started as a teenager
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.120]   Consuming mainstream personal finance books that talked about the value of retirement in your mid-60s
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.320]   Then I started working in
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.800]   Then I started working in
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.820]   Financial services in 2008 I joined a financial services company
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.920]   I started selling life insurance disability insurance long-term care insurance. I got my securities license. I started selling investments
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.720]   Became a financial advisor and started doing comprehensive holistic financial planning at the time
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.120]   And when I was doing that I was working in a business model that was structured
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.200]   based upon that that
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.560]   mainstream
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.520]   understanding of retirement and so I of course had those goals one of the ways that the company that I worked for attracted me was
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.680]   by talking about their pension programs and I I knew people that
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.080]   Were very wealthy and had a great retirement
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.000]   Lifestyle, it seemed awesome. It looked awesome
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.920]   And so I worked at that then along the way I became exposed to what is now known as the fire movement
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.880]   I found out that if I could save money
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.000]   More money then I could reach my goals even faster
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.080]   I
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.800]   Discovered the idea that I didn't have to wait until I was 65 to retire that I could retire
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.160]   perhaps 35 or 45 or 50 or 30 or 25 if I worked really hard and
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.040]   as I
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.920]   Discovered those concepts they became very very attractive to me and
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.080]   I started to work on those and I started to save and I started to really
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.800]   Invest myself into that approach and I've shared with you many of those ideas here at radical personal finance
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.720]   Along the way I discovered what I considered to be an even faster path. The faster path was
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.040]   Entrepreneurship as I was working through my own
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.280]   financial independence
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.040]   planning I thought well, why should I wait and
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.600]   Wait to be a millionaire and just save and invest to become a millionaire
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.280]   when I could live a millionaire's lifestyle with the right kind of lifestyle business and
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.640]   I started building a lifestyle business now at the beginning it was radical personal finance
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.680]   it has since been radical personal finance, but I do some other things as well and
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   my goal along the way was to build a lifestyle business and
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.000]   Originally my goal in building
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.000]   Said lifestyle business was six figures from a laptop
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.720]   All right
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.160]   because I thought what are all the things that I would do if I were financially independent and I created this vision this this goal of
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.080]   Kind of how I would live my life
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.680]   I engaged in these visioning exercises and I I thought it through and I became very clear on how I would live my life
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.600]   And I thought if I make six figures from a laptop with a very small
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.440]   Number of hours worked per week
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.920]   That would that would be great
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.720]   I never wanted to not work entirely
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.800]   That's that's that's never been a priority of mine, but I always wanted just to work a little bit, right?
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.400]   Maybe not four hours a week
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.840]   But maybe 24 hours a week seems pretty ideal for me for 24 hour 20 hours 24 hours a week
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.880]   Four days a week six hours a day. However, you slice it right for years
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.720]   I've wanted to and plan done actually to a good degree
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:44.040]   I haven't done it purposefully but work three months on take a month off work three months on take a month off
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.040]   I've always been attracted by this
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:53.240]   Kind of 50% effort 50% lifestyle because it has seemed to me to promise all of the things that I have wanted
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.600]   You know the the personal goals of things like not having to set an alarm clock to wake up in the morning
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   Being able to live wherever I want in the world not having a tremendous having tremendous time freedom
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.960]   I don't like to be constrained by a calendar where I have to be places at a certain time
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:15.280]   And so this these these at least we're all have always been the elements of kind of my dream life of how I would like
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.760]   to live
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   Part of that has also been that I wanted minimal stress
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:27.880]   Having had employees in the past. I determined I don't want to have employees. I don't want to have to
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.400]   Supervise people. I don't enjoy
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.440]   Supervising people. I don't enjoy managing
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.560]   Employees and I said, okay, I don't want that. And so I've I've over time I've made decisions
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.720]   I could have expanded and hired employees. I didn't want to do it. I also
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.640]   didn't want the responsibility right when you take responsibility of
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.600]   Paying people money then when you run out of money
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.080]   It it hurts a lot more when you know that other families are
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.600]   Relying on you and on your work. It's a tremendous amount of pressure
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:07.720]   I've always been pretty capable and never worried too much about running out of money for myself because I've got lots of backup plans
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.800]   But then of course you have people working for you and you observe and you think it's gonna hurt them a lot worse than it
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.240]   Hurts me and it it's a big responsibility. And so I said I don't want that and
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.280]   so I built a lifestyle business and
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.840]   I
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.400]   Told myself and I that it was awesome because it is it is right
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.040]   There's no there's no arguing that it's it's nice to have a lifestyle business
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.480]   it really is and I've told myself that that would be kind of the the ultimate that was as that was as big as as
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.520]   my
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.720]   It was as big as I could see right that was as big as I could see but what I have realized over the past
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.400]   year
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.800]   Especially is that that's always been a selfish goal. It's always been about me
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.200]   It's always been
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.920]   about me and what has happened is when you have at least when I have when I have had as
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.080]   As I have a selfish me focused goal
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.840]   Then it makes me worry
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.800]   About making it too big some people don't worry about that
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.740]   But there are some people aren't affected by that, but I personally have have have often been
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.180]   Affected by that right? Maybe you want to have a nice car
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:28.120]   Well, I look at it and I find it hard to justify why I should want the nicest car in the world
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.440]   right if what why if a if a
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.320]   If a car gets me down the road
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.680]   Then it's good enough
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.760]   But maybe I want a nicer car. Well, how much of a nicer car do I want? Do I want a Toyota Corolla?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.280]   Do I want a Lexus? Do I want a Tesla?
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.880]   Do I want a Ferrari or do I want a Bugatti right?
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.800]   There's a big difference between these vehicles and you look at it and you think well, I don't really
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:00.120]   Not really a Bugatti guy. I don't I don't even fit in those most of those supercars. Although to be fair
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.560]   I haven't tested them all maybe there's one that's big enough for me
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.660]   And so you think that's not really me and then what's the goal is the goal to have one or is the goal to have?
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:14.560]   A fleet is the goal to have 15 of them and some people have that that sense of ambition that sense of desire that that
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.800]   Endless lust for more more consumption, but I've never really had that
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.560]   partly due to my background partly due to my worldview partly due to my
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.440]   Looking at that and just consciously saying like this is stupid. Why not be content?
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.120]   You know, why not have enough to
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:44.080]   Channel John Bogle right with enough or to channel the scriptures right godliness and contentment is great gain
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.840]   and so
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.000]   I've cultivated a sense of contentment. And so what I've told myself is
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.880]   Philosophically, all right if Joshua if you're content and then you have enough you have enough money
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.080]   I've never I've not found myself limited much by lack of money
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.680]   So you're doing fine
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:09.040]   And so you should just enjoy enjoy take your make your 24-hour work week and and go with it
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.720]   but
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.800]   That has resulted in my producing last that has resulted in my working less because I've often been under motivated to
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.440]   to
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.440]   To achieve more from my own ends
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.800]   So what's changed
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.600]   What has changed for me is I
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.480]   Have finally become willing to embrace a sense of responsibility
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   Related to
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.000]   service and
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.640]   I have embraced on a deeper way than ever before
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.000]   the reality that I have a
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.440]   responsibility to serve I
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:06.080]   Have been given much and therefore much is required of me and I'm that much that is required of me
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:13.720]   For me to achieve that for me to do that. It's not enough for me to just engage in
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.120]   Lifestyle business. It's not enough for me to engage in
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.200]   kind of hanging out hanging out and doing just enough and
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:29.680]   what a tragedy it would be for me if I wasted some of the most important years and
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.280]   God willing decades of my life
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.240]   hanging out
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.840]   Now it's taken a while for me to be willing to say that without hedging in a public way
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.240]   Because I have found
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.440]   the siren song of
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.800]   financial independence very attractive I
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.920]   found that siren song of of
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.120]   the beach lifestyle
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.160]   very attractive and
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.240]   I don't wish to condemn others for the decisions that they have made
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.440]   I I've said I don't I haven't quite gotten it for a number of years
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   But I have often felt like I need to try it out
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.960]   Who am I to criticize someone else for the decisions they make if I haven't tried it out and the more that I have tried
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.840]   It out the more I have realized it's it's it's not for me. It's not fulfilling. It's not
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.160]   I wish I could have learned this at an early age
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.360]   one of the jobs that I've had in my life that is just
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:39.640]   Taught me this lesson and gave me a good reference point when I was in high school
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.200]   I had a job working in an office for a friend of mine and
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.160]   He was giving a high school student a summer job
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:52.600]   and so he just basically brought me into the office and told his office manager here have Joshua work for you and
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.800]   the office manager
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.480]   Didn't quite know what to do with me. She hadn't necessarily been looking for an employee
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.320]   she was just giving
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.520]   giving the boss's friend a
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.640]   Job, and so they kind of gave me some things to do but not a lot and at the time
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.880]   I could come into work every day and I was supposed to answer the phone
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.800]   But the phone very rarely rang and there were a few errands that I could run for them
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.960]   But they didn't really embrace the idea of teaching me a lot or training me a lot
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.900]   And so I've sat at the desk and I read novels all day every day. I
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.960]   Love to read novels. I had great novels to read but I felt like I was useless. I felt like what's the point?
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   why am I sitting here reading and
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:41.080]   I learned that just because something is fun doesn't mean that that's what you want to do all all the time doing something
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   That's fun is great
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.720]   when it's a
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:53.400]   Break from the work and I've had other experiences that have shown that to me, but I think I was still
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   Engaged with the idea that well, maybe it's just that I didn't have enough autonomy, right?
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.680]   Maybe it was that with my summertime work
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.920]   Maybe it would have been fun if I hadn't had to stay in the office, right?
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.840]   maybe that maybe it was fun maybe reading novels would have been more fun if I could go to the cigar lounge every day and
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.880]   Smoke cigars and read my novels there from 10 a.m. To 4 p.m
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.680]   And maybe it would be fun if I didn't have to worry about paying 15 bucks for a stick of tobacco
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.880]   Because I had so much money and I was actually financially independent and it would be fine
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.440]   and so I've I've had these lessons along the way thus my
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.240]   oft-stated discomfort with
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.140]   Many aspects of the financial independence movement, but I've often wondered maybe I just haven't experienced enough
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.660]   Maybe I just don't have enough money. Maybe it's different if I had a couple million bucks
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.560]   Maybe it'd be different if I were in a different society a place that I liked more
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.460]   Maybe it would be different if I had a nicer house
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:58.360]   Maybe it would be different if my my personal hedonism were or more appropriate to me and the way that I want to live
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:04.920]   Well, I'm here to say that it's not and
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.520]   Pursuing lifestyle
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.600]   Has never been a
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.680]   Has not ever been fulfilling for me
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.100]   meaning
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:26.360]   pursuing lifestyle just well if I could just get a little bit have a little bit more money or have a little bit more freedom
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   or have a little bit more a
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.620]   Little bit more
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.140]   Fun be in a more more beautiful place
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:40.540]   Then I'll be able to do it, but I don't find it. I don't find it enjoyable
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.300]   I don't find it. I find it not fun and
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.700]   What it has become clear to me is
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:17:00.500]   Those activities those lifestyle pursuit activities are most rewarding
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.180]   When they are an interlude
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.820]   For your other moments of work and of contribution and of service
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:22.300]   An ice-cold drink is best after a long day's work
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:28.380]   And I've reached the point where
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.660]   That has become clear enough for me
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.740]   by
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:40.860]   philosophical introspection and by practical experience for me to be willing to
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.900]   reject
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.860]   building
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:52.240]   Lifestyle so-called lifestyle to the extent that it costs me service
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:18:02.820]   How does this relate to money why is this a financial mistake well because when I have pursued lifestyle I have always
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.940]   labored under the
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.820]   Constraint of what's enough?
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.380]   All right, if you could live on
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.620]   $50,000 a year or a hundred thousand dollars a year. Well, then enough is
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:20.500]   25 times your expenses and so two and a half million bucks in the bank. Boom
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.180]   You're good. Fifty thousand dollars a year two and a half million bucks in the bank. You're financially independent
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.980]   100,000, you know
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.020]   Fine, you're good four million
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.300]   So as
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.420]   I've I
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.580]   Get that math
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.020]   Totally messed up. You know what? I mean? I was alluding the 4% rule. Forgive me
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.340]   The math totally totally did not come out right there
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.300]   25 times annual expenses so 50
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.980]   100,000 a year
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.100]   You need two and a half million bucks
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.320]   The point is that you're always looking at it saying was just just enough right just enough
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:10.860]   so I need just enough and while I don't deny that contentment is a virtue that I wish to
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:16.300]   That I wish to appreciate I think that contentment
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:22.980]   can be seen can be something that keeps people from pursuing more and that the pursuit of more is
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.500]   Deeply gratifying
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.500]   That the pursuit of improvement is
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:35.380]   fundamentally an important part of the human condition I
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:42.900]   Still struggle to put this into words. I've thought about this concept for
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.420]   Months and months and months and months and I don't know how to
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.220]   Express it more clearly. I've written it out for myself. I've thought it out. I've talked it out
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.780]   I'm doing it publicly, but if I were to put it into a concise
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.580]   statement
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.620]   I would simply say that
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:08.020]   There are some things in life that don't get old
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.500]   So, for example, can you experience
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.940]   Deeper connection with people that you love and care about I don't find that that gets old
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:25.220]   You can
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.860]   simultaneously
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.380]   enjoy
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:35.700]   What you're doing enjoy where you are while looking forward to experiencing more if you gather your
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:42.860]   good friends around your table and you share a great meal together full of
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.180]   amazing food and fun conversation and rich connection
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.060]   You come away from that time
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:56.340]   So thankful for the depths of relationship that you have enjoyed and the love that you have shared with one another
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.260]   Looking forward to the next time of being able to do more of that
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:07.220]   There are other things in life that are the same way you do a lot of it and
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.740]   You do more of it and it feels really good
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.260]   What I don't think is one of those things is
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.180]   Taking it easy or having a break or
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.060]   Goofing off or doing all the things that you want to do
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:31.740]   there are other things in life that are best in moderation and I guess what I have I
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.020]   Guess what has become very clear to me over the past few years
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.260]   Simply that if you pursue
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.020]   lifestyle
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:48.220]   That's what and and and that life and by lifestyle here. I mean if you pursue
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.300]   Disengagement if you pursue I'm just gonna hang out
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.900]   It's not one of those things that can be done more of without damage
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.340]   It's rather one of those things that is wonderful in small doses
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:11.100]   Whereas service work you can do more you can serve more effectively you can work harder
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:17.220]   That's one of those things that is like love like relationships. That's one of those things that can go deeper on
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.760]   So what does this mean practically? How am I correcting this particular thing?
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.560]   Well, I have made some changes
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   that
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.640]   I'm becoming I'm willing to
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.160]   give up
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.640]   some of my personal freedom some of my lifestyle and
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.160]   A in order to work more and to be able to serve others more in various ways
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.000]   much of this related to business, but not all but I'm willing to
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.620]   Give up some of my freedoms and give up some of my
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.120]   indulgences in order to serve others more
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:02.160]   Part of this has to do with a recent travels. I started traveling and for some reason it was kind of a mini retirement
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.960]   You'll notice I said was I have ended for now our
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:12.260]   Global tour. I ended it prematurely for the moment because of the
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.840]   coronavirus restrictions
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:20.320]   partly due to my not being able to get into some of the places that I'm very keen to get into at the moment partly
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.000]   Due to just the frustration of dealing with it. There's nothing that'll break a father's heart
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.240]   Then seeing your children
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.680]   Subjected to invasive medical testing that is not fun
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.240]   and now if it's necessary you do it because you know, that's what's best for them, but I just
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.920]   So tired of seeing my two-year-old my four-year-old my six-year-old and my eight-year-old. It's not such a big deal
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.240]   But just seeing them cry with having swabs stuck in their noses so we can get on an airplane
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.440]   It's brutal and I'm I don't want to do it anymore
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.560]   So part of his Kovan partly also is that Asia is still shut down
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.840]   I was planning to be in Asia this winter and the places that I want to go
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.820]   I can't get into and so I've ended our travels for now
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.960]   and
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.740]   I've rented a house back in the United States. I've moved back to the United States
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.100]   I don't know that that will be forever
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:15.080]   But for now in order for me to serve people effectively, I can't be across the border. It's just too difficult
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:22.840]   I haven't been able to to do things that are important because of the the difficulties with the travel restrictions
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   so I've rented a house in Florida and
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:31.960]   I'm in the process of moving my family back into that house. And one of the things that I'm doing with it is I'm simply
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.360]   Committing myself to
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.920]   work
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.200]   To work now. I'll share with you. Honestly, what is
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   You know what my experience is with that but what I mean by I'm committing myself to work is I'm giving up on
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:57.280]   The the freedom the I don't want to work too much. I'm giving up on the I don't want employees
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:04.640]   I'm gonna hire employees. I'm going to take on that responsibility again. I'm gonna take on calendar appointments again
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.280]   I'm gonna do those things and because I don't want to
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:15.400]   Sorry to steal this from other people, but I don't want to die with my music still in me and I feel like the pursuit
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:21.600]   As I have pursued quote-unquote what I'm calling the financial independence lifestyle
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.160]   There's that that hasn't been
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.840]   What I have wanted
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.520]   And so I'm grateful that I have had the chance to try it out
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.880]   I'm one who likes to test things. I'm one who likes to verify things
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.840]   I'm one who likes to know for my for myself is the pot actually hot
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.680]   I have one of my children is like this
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:46.240]   I see so much of me in him you'll tell him something and he just wants to see wants to find out for himself
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.160]   And so I'm grateful that I've had the good fortune to be able to try things for myself
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.440]   But I believe that there is more fulfillment in working
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:04.080]   Than there is in resting. I believe that there is more fulfillment in service
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.760]   Than in being served. I believe that there is more
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.680]   fulfillment in a lifestyle that
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.080]   prioritizes
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.320]   Labor and growth and impact rather than a lifestyle that
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.760]   prioritizes rest and
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.160]   Relaxation and an
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.040]   inward focused selfish lifestyle and
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:38.320]   How does this apply financially well if you're going to work and if you're gonna serve then that means that
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.160]   You're gonna make a lot more money
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.080]   As long as you're not as long as you are working in an area where money is
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.580]   Where money is exchanged as a measurement of value?
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:54.520]   My wife her work with my children is not measured in terms of value
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.240]   There are many professions and worthwhile
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.200]   sources of labor
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:05.640]   you might have an aged parent that you are caring for or an ailing relative that you're caring for and those
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.080]   Though that that hard work that labor is not going to be denominated in
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.360]   financial terms
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.440]   but
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   Most areas of labor can effectively be denominated in financial time terms and the more people that you serve the more money that you make
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.840]   And so it's been good for me to experience the things that I have experienced
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.880]   I've enjoyed our little mini retirement over the past few months traveling the world and taking my children and doing cool things
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.960]   And having great adventures with them
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.320]   but I
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.040]   Want at this point? I want more work and I want
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:50.240]   More service more labor more responsibility more impact
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.360]   Much more than I want more personal freedom more lifestyle, etc
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.080]   I've asked myself
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.640]   Well, Joshua, do you need to change things that you've said publicly? Are there any?
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:12.440]   Episodes of radical personal finance that you need to repudiate. Is there anything that you need to adjust?
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.160]   The answer is I don't think so I
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.040]   Don't think that there's anything
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   fundamentally flawed
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.360]   with
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.640]   The pursuit of financial independence. It doesn't have to be at odds with
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.320]   financial independence, you know financial independence versus
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.360]   versus work I don't think that
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:40.520]   Having personal freedom has to be at odds with saying well, I I I'm willing to give up personal freedom
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.360]   In fact for years I have said I believe that those who?
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.840]   Those who
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.440]   You value the though the people who seem to have the strongest
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.920]   Point to say are those who?
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:03.240]   Know the opportunities that they're giving up. For example, let's think of a relationships, right?
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.720]   maybe I'm let's say that I come into a relationship and and
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.640]   I'm a very unattractive person. Maybe I'm
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.320]   very obese and
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:21.720]   physically handicapped and just emotionally incompetent and I'm a jerk to all around me, etc
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.560]   And then by magic someday I find a woman who says, you know what?
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:31.840]   I'll accept you Joshua and is willing to go into a relationship with me
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.240]   And so we go ahead and get married
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:42.480]   How's she gonna feel knowing that she was the only one in the world who was willing to accept me and my brutish?
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.720]   Personality and my ugly behavior and my boorish mannerisms, etc
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:55.560]   it'd be very different in terms of her confidence in my love for her if she knows that I'm
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.480]   Someone who was attractive physically attractive emotionally attractive
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.680]   kind had lots of options and
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:10.340]   Then I chose to enter into a relationship with her. That's gonna put a very different
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.440]   feeling on you if you're chosen to do something versus if you're just the only person that says yes and
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.240]   So relating that kind of same level of thinking
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:29.040]   When people give up things people give up freedom then they can make a more focused decision as
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:36.640]   I've taught over the past year as my survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis course where I teach internationalization always said
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.920]   to make a plan
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:47.440]   That allows you to escape from a crisis does not mean that you have to leave during the crisis
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:54.720]   It's just simply to know that you have the choice to leave during the crisis and I think that a lot of us
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.800]   Will feel better about our decisions knowing that we're making those decisions voluntarily
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:07.240]   By choice rather than being forced into it. That's that's how I feel is I don't regret
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.600]   Building additional layers of freedom for myself. I still appreciate freedom
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.840]   I desire to to engage in a free lifestyle in the future
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.280]   but if I
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   choose to surrender
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.220]   Some aspect of my own personal freedom to gain something else that I want
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.640]   it makes me feel better doing that knowing that that's of my own choice and
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:42.040]   that I'm making a conscious decision rather than feeling like it's out of my out of my grasp and so I
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.600]   Don't think that there's any
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   Fundamental disconnect between what I have shared
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.560]   And what I teach and what I've articulated in this particular
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.120]   Podcast for you for me. It's more a matter of
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:05.720]   Am I willing to build a bigger business am I willing to hire employees am I willing to
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:12.480]   Chain myself down to some degree to one location. Am I willing to
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   To do those things. Am I willing to work outside my house?
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:24.320]   Am I willing to commit to a calendar? Am I willing to get on an airplane and travel for business more, etc? And
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.360]   As
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:34.200]   I'm willing to do that then of course that will result in a far higher income and that's something that in the past I
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.400]   Didn't want I didn't value I didn't feel it was necessary
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.200]   I didn't want it because I didn't want the corresponding losses of freedom
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.000]   but now I see that as I desire more service if
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.480]   My focus is on service. It's going to require more work from me and
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.440]   I'm willing to do that. But then of course effective service
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.960]   Will be rewarded by far more financial gain
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:08.600]   So that's one of my mistakes I share that with you part of it's just a way of me telling you
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.000]   Some of the changes why am I quitting working? Oh, I'm I quitting traveling right now
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.440]   It's not that I can't continue to travel. It's that I feel like I'm wasting my time. I feel like I'm wasting my precious time
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.760]   It's like okay. I've been traveling for months. I've done some work along the way, but it's like
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:31.360]   What's the point? What's the point? Why just bounce from one place to another? I don't that's not
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:38.780]   I've gotten antsy and frustrated because the logistics of traveling harm the logistics of working and even
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.600]   As I've shared, you know a couple months ago
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.360]   I was doing a lot of traveling and I
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.840]   Booked a house in France for a month getting to be able to sit down and work
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.520]   Which is such a relief because it felt like okay, finally
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:56.360]   Finally I can get some work done and I just felt felt that and so what I'm doing now is a continuation of that
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.900]   Where I'm canceling the travels now
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:04.080]   At least on an ongoing basis setting up a household and there's this
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.760]   for me kind of an intense sense of
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:15.200]   Relief about doing that. It's there's an intense sense of okay. Finally I can I can stop playing around
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:21.080]   I can get to work and it feels really good in my head to be willing to do that. I
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.480]   Encourage you if you are in the other side
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:31.280]   It's good to get a chance to to take a break, right if you're feeling like Josh
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.360]   I've been working non-stop for 10 years. I appreciate that. I've served others
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   I've worked and this has been great, but I need a break take a break. Take a sabbatical take a rest
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:47.880]   All right, give give yourself a rest if the land itself can benefit from being furloughed for a time
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.280]   Then you yourself
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   May need a time of rest
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:35:04.200]   But then if you find that your rest period was enough don't be scared to get back to work
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.160]   That's where I'm at
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   I'm ready to work.
