[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Hey, Stackers, just a quick note before we get today's show a-rolling.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.920]   I know a lot of you follow our movie and television suggestions, and you also may know that every
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.840]   year I publish my top movies.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.720]   I list every single movie that I saw the year before.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.080]   This last year, I saw 39, which is down significantly from the 62 that I saw the year before, but
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.080]   still a big number.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.680]   I saw a lot more TV this year, as some of you that follow the show closely know.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.840]   But I've listed them from best to worst.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.520]   If you want to see my rankings and avoid bad movies, which will be the bottom third of
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.240]   the movies that I saw, and also if you want to help the show and you're watching them
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.660]   on Amazon, we have click-throughs right to Amazon.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.660]   So you'll help the show.
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.120]   We get a little thank you from Amazon when you do that.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.760]   And you also can make sure that you don't see movies that stink.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.600]   Here's where you go, stackingbenjamins.com/2015.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.200]   It's stackingbenjamins.com and the number 2015.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   All right, let's get on it.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.840]   Hi, this is James Kenson from the Cash Car Convert podcast.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.760]   When I'm not crushing car debt, I'm stacking Benjamins.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:40.480]   Live from Joe's mom's basement, it's the Stacking Benjamins Show.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.880]   On today's show, we're getting radical.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.360]   From radical personal finance, Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.880]   Plus, why 44% of top US executives don't want to hire you.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.320]   And it's not because of all those papers you plagiarized in college, Mike.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   Yeah, we know you did that.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.080]   And we'll have a discussion of the recent film, The Big Short.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:19.120]   And now, two guys we refer to as a couple of big shorts, Joe and O, G-G-G-G-G.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   Think of me as Big Shot.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   Big Shot, yes.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   Yeah, got that.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   Got that.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   Totally got that wrong.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   Unless you're from the Northeast, then there's an R in just about everything, isn't there?
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.760]   I'm not going to touch that.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.320]   That's making fun of another area, man.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   I'm not making fun of anybody.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.560]   I'm just saying that you just throw an R in there and you fit in.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560]   It's fine.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   It's all right.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.560]   It's good.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.960]   It's like now, you know, I've got to learn to start saying y'all.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   Now that I'm-
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   You don't say y'all.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   I don't.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   Why not?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   It's so much easier.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   I know.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   And it's more appropriate too, isn't it?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   You guys.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   Youse guys.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   Hey, youse guys.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   Okay.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   Right.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   Youse guys want to go get a cheeseburger?
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   Hey, welcome to the Stacking Benjamins Show.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   I'm just letting it go.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   I'm Joe Stewart.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   I'm Joe Sheets.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   I'm Joe Salci.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   I'm Joe Salci.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   I average Joe money on Twitter.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.800]   And on today's show, we've got some fun because as Doug so appropriately said before, Joshua
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.440]   Sheets, radical personal finance, getting radical, OG.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.320]   It's getting radical here on the show.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320]   It's going to be crazy.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.100]   We're going to talk about Dave Ramsey.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.480]   You want to be Dave Ramsey?
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.040]   We're going to show you how to invest like Dave Ramsey to become- and by the way, it
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.920]   ain't a rip on Dave Ramsey, OG.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.080]   This is not going to be a anti-Dave Ramsey show.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   That's okay.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   He's a nice guy.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   He's good.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.720]   I'm just pointing out that just because we're pointing out a different-
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   And put your pitchforks away, everyone.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   Easy.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.160]   And torches.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.060]   You know how the Dave Ramsey fans get.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.060]   And that's not a slight-
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.540]   I was thinking they're going to come with us to go torch and pitchfork Dave Ramsey.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.540]   His fans are?
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.540]   No, our fans.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.540]   Oh, our fans.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.280]   Put them away, everybody, because Dave is a friend and Dave's always trying to get on
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.420]   the show and we never seem to have time for him.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.240]   But something we do have time for is to head to stackingbedgements.com/magnifiedmoney.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   You know why, OG?
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.580]   Because you save so much money when you go there.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.980]   $450 on average.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.420]   I love getting letters from people saying, "Guess what?
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.840]   I just found out how bad my checking account stinks because I went to stackingbedgments.com/magnifiedmoney."
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.100]   You can also up that.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.820]   So I'm talking to my brother on the phone and my brother says, "I hear your magnified money
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.780]   commercial all the time."
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.500]   And I've heard Nick on the show.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.660]   I just never think it applies to me.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.220]   So he never opens his bank statements because he does all his banking online.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.940]   So in fact, he was saying the other day, doesn't he know why he still gets bank statements.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.420]   He's like, "I should have had that turned off."
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.700]   But anyway, he said he decided to look after listening to a recent show.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.380]   Point zero one.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.740]   He said, "I made three cents of interest on my money market account."
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.180]   Yeah, nothing good.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.380]   So stackingbedgments.com/magnifiedmoney and my brother and everybody else out there will
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.380]   find heaven.
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.300]   That's what we call it here, heaven, right?
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.700]   And another place that's heaven, if you pay your bills on time, stackingbedgments.com/sofi.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   These are so bad.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.420]   It's S-O-F-I.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.380]   Don't call it Sophie, OG.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.760]   It's Sofi.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.180]   And when you go to Sofi, what you'll find is that they have fantastic rates on refinancing
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.680]   your student loans.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.980]   Talked on Monday about our friend, Cece, saving her friend a bunch of money because she told
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.980]   her about stackingbedgments.com/sofi.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.080]   Dan Macklin and the gang over there, they do a great job of taking care of you when
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.680]   it comes to your personal loans, to refinancing your house, buying a new house or student
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.260]   loans, the area that they started with.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.660]   That is that.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.660]   You know what?
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.220]   Sponsors are happy.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.400]   Fans are happy.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.220]   Let's make you and I happy by talking about some headlines, OG.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.100]   Hello, darlings, and now it's time for your favorite part of the show, our Stacking Benjamins
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100]   Headlines.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.700]   I know why 44% of the top U.S. executives don't want to hire you, OG.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.860]   Because I'll overshadow them in the boardroom.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.220]   Joshua Spodek, contributor from Inc.com, wrote this at Inc.com recently in a survey of U.S.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.220]   executives.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.980]   44% said Americans lack soft skills, which are poorly taught by traditional education.
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.700]   You know, we were talking about English majors a couple of weeks ago.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.540]   Don't get that riled up again.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.200]   Put those pitchforks away.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.940]   We're about to say something good about English majors.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.900]   Because soft skills, it turns out, are the area that most employers think that people
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.220]   are competent when it comes to the area of expertise, OG.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.580]   They don't know how to get along with other people.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.400]   You have to be nice to your cube mates.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   And isn't that horrible?
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   Isn't that...
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   Office mates.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.940]   That's the thing you have a problem with, isn't it?
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.740]   Well, I think that's why you keep me down here.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.340]   But I have been known to have a tough working environment relationship before.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.340]   Which is not good.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.180]   Do you recognize that is not good?
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.180]   I don't necessarily care.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.180]   Because...
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.980]   You see those studies about how hard it is to train a new employee though, and how much
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.980]   money you lose?
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.500]   Well, that's like the whole Zappos thing, right?
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.620]   They go through the whole first two weeks of training and then tell them, "We will give
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.540]   you a $2,000 check to leave."
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.820]   If this isn't for you, take the two grand and run.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.940]   Because it's more expensive for us to keep you around than it is just to cut your check
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.940]   rent.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.940]   They say that the US is not the only country monopolizing this stat, that the people don't
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.420]   know how to interface with other people.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.140]   Across the Atlantic, a study by Development Economics Research Group last year estimated
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   that by 2025, the shortage of soft skills in the UK alone could cost as much as $22
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.620]   billion a year in foregone economic output.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.940]   Just because people don't know how to communicate with each other and get the job done right
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.940]   the first time.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.940]   We've talked about this.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.940]   Imagine if you could do it with Emojicons.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.940]   Emoticons?
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.940]   Emojicons?
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.980]   What are they called?
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.980]   Just completely...
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.540]   Anger face, anger face, lightning bolt.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.340]   That means get your act together.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.500]   That means we need you to be more productive.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.660]   That commercial with Mike Krzyzewski from Duke, where he texts his former player and
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.260]   his player's like, "What?"
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.900]   Because he texted him like an Emojicon.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.900]   What are they called?
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.900]   Modicons or Emojicons?
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.900]   I think it's a Modicon.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.900]   Modicon.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   Okay.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.100]   So he texts him an Emoticon and it doesn't represent anything.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.380]   He just thinks it does.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.020]   So then the next commercial, he's watching with his kids and he says, "Hey, great shot.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.020]   Way to go to the hoop.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.140]   I'm cheering for you.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.140]   Keep going."
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.140]   His kids are like, "Basketball, basketball.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.140]   Clap, clap.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.140]   You know, 100, 100.
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.140]   Yay."
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.140]   And he's like, "What do you say back?"
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.140]   He goes, "Thanks, coach."
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.140]   You know, or whatever.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.260]   They're all just communicating in this weird language.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.940]   That's what we need as a 14 year old to translate this whole show.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.140]   Maybe transcribe the show into all Emoticons.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.580]   Angry face, angry face, lightning bolt.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.660]   That's the whole show.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.820]   There you've got the Stacky Benjamin show right there.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.340]   You never need to listen again.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.340]   That's all we do here.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.700]   But please listen again.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.700]   But soft skills.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.700]   Please clap.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.960]   It says we know how to teach soft skills.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.060]   Soft skills come from experience, not abstract learning.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.980]   You have to be engaged with other people.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.980]   It's called empathy, right?
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.100]   You have to have communication with other people so you can decide what's appropriate
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.540]   to say and not say.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.140]   That's why when I see kids buried with their faces in their iPads and not talking to anybody,
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.820]   this is what they're talking about right here.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.780]   It's so interesting when you look at all of these platforms we have, right?
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.980]   These social platforms we have to talk to each other and we've forgotten how to talk
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.980]   to each other.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.980]   Not good.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.540]   We'll link to that on our show notes at stackybenjamins.com.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:31.820]   Second article today comes to us from Napa-Net.org, the National Association of Plant Advisors,
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.980]   people that handle things like 401ks.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.260]   This headline, health savings accounts surged last year in 2015.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.980]   Assets and health savings accounts, HSAs, totaled more than $30 billion in assets at
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.500]   year-end 2015.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.500]   Ready for this?
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   It's a year-over-year increase of 25% for HSA assets and HSA investment assets increased
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.780]   even more.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:02.860]   HSA investment assets reaching an estimated $4.2 billion in December, up 33% year-over-year.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.860]   That's amazing.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.740]   Well, HSAs are the wave of the future, right?
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.780]   Everybody's going to these high deductible plans and putting more of the cost of standard
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.500]   care onto the individual.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.980]   And assuming you're healthy, OG, it's a great way to go.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.740]   Well, healthy, unhealthy is immaterial because more and more companies are going to these
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.540]   plans exclusively, you know, just to help mitigate the rising cost of healthcare.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.660]   They say that with retirement security of growing concern and paying healthcare expenses
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.580]   in retirement is of course a large part of that concern.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.220]   HSAs offer account owners a number of advantages, including contributions, reduced taxable income
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.540]   because your money goes in pre-tax, earnings on the account build up tax-free, distributions
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.180]   for qualified expenses from the account are not subject to taxation.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.060]   According to recent Fidelity study, a couple aged 65 today needs a quarter million dollars
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.260]   set aside just for healthcare costs.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.780]   So when you look at your investment portfolio or you look at your retirement accounts, take
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.660]   250,000 of that and say, this is my healthcare account.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.300]   And then the rest you can live on.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.020]   I think that's really shocking to people.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.580]   HSAs are a popular option that you can consider, especially if you start early, whereby you
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.220]   might be able to accumulate some of that, or if not all of that, quote unquote, need
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.220]   for retirement.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   Big sums of money.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.140]   A lot of tax-free money there, OG.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.140]   Good stuff.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.220]   We'll link to that also in the show notes.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.900]   So our lessons, number one, be nice to your neighbors, OG.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.460]   Be nice to people.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.820]   Practice what mom preaches.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.820]   Empathy.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.100]   Empathy goes everywhere.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.820]   Learn to deal with people around you.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.780]   Far more, well, not far more important, but equally as important as the technical aspects
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.100]   that we talk about on this show, learn to deal with other people and you'll get further
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.100]   ahead in the office.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.000]   And those 44% of people that don't want to hire people will want to hire you.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.940]   So that's, you want to get a leg up in the workforce, learn communication skills.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.860]   And then number two, HSA, it's not just for lunch anymore.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:03.820]   Yeah, that probably didn't make sense.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.900]   It doesn't make sense to me, but rarely do things make sense to me.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.740]   Just trying to put a slogan on these, you know, all the popular shows have slogans these
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.740]   days.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.740]   I got you.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.940]   So yeah, the segment brought to you by, right.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.460]   Hey, guess what?
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.500]   Joshua, Joshua Sheets, radical personal finance.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.260]   We've been talking to Joshua about coming on this show forever.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:31.420]   And finally, Joshua is finally, he was bored enough, ran out of everything else to do.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.940]   Of course, the show radical personal finance, Joshua and I joke that we are the yin and
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:41.220]   yang and the personal finance shows where our show is magazine style, lots and lots
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.220]   of different topics.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:48.280]   So Joshua dives deep into one topic while on most of his shows, he has more letters
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   behind his name.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.280]   So Joshua, ready?
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   MSFS, CFP, CLU, CHFC, CASL, CAP, RHU, REBC.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   What the heck is an REBC?
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   Nope, don't know.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.280]   BMOC?
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   That's the one I have.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   He's a financial planner of the world's leading authority.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   The world's leading authority.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.280]   The world's leading authority.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   Integrating lifestyle goals without conflict.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280]   Love talking to Joshua.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   And of course, he always has a strong opinion.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   Let's talk to him about his opinion on becoming Dave Ramsey.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   How about that?
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   Cool, let's do it.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   Joshua Sheets, the world's leading authority.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   I'm a big fan of Dave Ramsey.
