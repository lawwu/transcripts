[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   we tackle the subject of mortgages.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   For many of us, our housing decisions
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   will be some of the biggest financial transactions
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   in our lives, and the cost associated
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   with those housing decisions will be dramatically affected
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   by our mortgage decisions.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So I'm gonna equip you with some ideas
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and tools and tactics and information
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   on how to get the best possible mortgage.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Conveniently enough, I'm speaking to Casey Fleming,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   who's the author of a book called "The Loan Guide,"
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   "How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   your personal finance podcast dedicated
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   to helping you figure out how to live a rich life today
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   while building and destroying,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   in the positive, you know, modern,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   like, hey, I'm crushing it sense,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   destroying the path to financial freedom
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I'm your host, your guide,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and your fellow journeyman on this path.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   (siren blaring)
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I don't know about you, but, you know,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   when I first got my first mortgage,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I've only ever had one so far in my life,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and I don't have it anymore,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   but when I first got my first mortgage,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I thought I was pretty smart.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I thought I had, you know,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I thought I knew what I was doing,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   because after all, I was just gonna go out
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   and get a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate interest, right?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So it's simple, and I considered getting
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   a 15-year mortgage or a 30-year mortgage,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and I decided to get a 30-year mortgage.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I knew that you should never do anything
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   except get a fixed-rate mortgage.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I knew that you should only get a 15 or 30-year mortgage,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and I didn't want a 15.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I got a 30, and I knew that you should put
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   at least 20% down, and I knew that I was
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   making the right decisions.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   (laughs)
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   In retrospect, I'll tell you what.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I don't think I knew nearly what I wish I had known,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   and in hindsight, I wish I had done some more study
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   and preparation for that decision.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Now, I've tried to make up for lost time
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   and mend the error of my ways with some additional study,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and today's show is part of that.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   My guest is Casey Fleming, who is the author
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   of "The Loan Guide," how to get the best possible mortgage,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   which is an excellent book on the subject.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   If you're gonna buy a house, I recommend you probably.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   This is a good one for you to read.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And we're gonna try to chart the path for you a little bit
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   and help you with some knowledge and wisdom
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   and insight to make your next mortgage
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   a little bit better.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Casey, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   - Well, thank you very much, and thank you for having me.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   - For sure.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So we connected at FinCon 2015 in Charlotte,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and you gave me a copy of your book,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and we had breakfast together, and I was so impressed
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   with what you talked about that I said,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   "Let's have you on the show, and let's talk about mortgages."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And what I'd like to do quickly before we get started
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   is give a quick background.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   What's your background in the mortgage industry?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   - I started off as an appraiser.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And founded a company and built it to one of the largest
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   appraisal and consulting firms in the San Francisco Bay Area
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   back in the '80s.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And then in the mid-'90s, I transitioned over into lending.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So I've been lending now for a little over 20 years.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   - So why did you write a book on lending?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   'Cause your book is called "The Loan Guide--
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage,"
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   which is the focus of our conversation.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   What led to creating the book?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   - Well, some folks have asked me if it was a labor of love,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and actually I answered that no, it was a labor of being
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   really ticked off.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And what I mean by that is everything that led up to the crash
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   was a lot of really bad lending practices
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   on the part of players throughout the entire industry.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And it was very frustrating as someone who is very involved
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   in our professional organizations, and I know a lot of really good,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   ethical, professional loan officers,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   watching the bad apples ruin everything by essentially
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   taking advantage of the consumers was really maddening.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And obviously we all know how bad the results were.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We all know who all got hurt.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So the purpose of the book was really to empower consumers
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   to educate themselves so that they can make wise choices
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   regardless of whether or not they're getting good advice
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   from their particular mortgage advisor.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   - I think it's a good job, and it's one of the best books
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   on mortgage--I mean, just the mortgage process that I have read.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I want to read a quote from "The Forward"
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   to establish the context for our conversation.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You wrote this, "Nothing in this book is terribly exciting or sexy.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Reading about mortgages won't keep you up at night.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   You'll be going through pages excitedly,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   wondering how it will all turn out.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   If I had my druthers, I'd rather be reading a tabloid.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yet a mortgage is almost certainly the largest debt you will ever have.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   There are some sobering implications to this.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You will probably spend more money on your mortgages over your lifetime
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   than you will on anything else.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I repeat, you will spend more money on your mortgages over your lifetime
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   than you will on anything else.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   More of your working hours will be spent earning money
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   to pay your mortgage than any other debt.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Families that manage their mortgage portfolio properly
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   can have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   more in assets when they retire than those who don't."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   In case you thought that was a great quote
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   because it sets the context for how important the discussion is,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   no, it's not exciting or sexy, but it is important.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Yet so many of us wander into getting a mortgage
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and we know nothing about it, nothing about our options.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   What are the biggest--let me say maybe the two or three biggest mistakes
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   that you see borrowers make when it comes to getting a mortgage?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Well, I think probably the first thing is not shopping hard enough.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   They'll go off and they'll shop online and they'll end up being drawn in
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   by some great advertising, some great marketing.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And there's a lot of money in the mortgage industry,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   so there's some pretty refined marketing that's very, very well done.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And it's pretty easy to draw someone into something
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   that isn't necessarily the best thing that they should do for themselves.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The other thing that folks do, I think, is they walk in
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   with a preconceived notion as to what they want.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And I hear these strange rules of thumb all the time.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   You should never pay points or you should never pay any costs
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   or you should always get a 30-year fixed mortgage.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And the problem is, of course, is if you do that,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   it really limits your ability to structure a mortgage in a way
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   that gives you the lowest possible lifetime cost
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   for your specific profile and goals and needs.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Can you give some examples of perhaps cases that you've worked on
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   where by laying aside the preconceived ideas
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and just considering the market at the time of purchase,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   the borrower was able to get a better deal?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Oh, sure. I work with a lot of Silicon Valley engineers,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   so they do tend to walk in with a lot of preconceived notions
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   because they've done a lot of research.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So one of the most common is you should never pay any points.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And what I do is we earn the exact same amount,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   no matter what you choose to do, whether you pay points or not pay points.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And--pardon me.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   So we're going to earn the same amount no matter what you do.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   So what I do is I give people options to pay points if they want to,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   and then I show them how much the various options are going to cost over time.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And probably 75%, 80% of the time, engineers who walk in and say,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   "I don't want to pay any points," will take a look at what it's really going to cost them
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   over whatever they believe their holding period is going to be, say, 7 years or so.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   They'll look at the total cost over that holding period,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and they will decide to go ahead and pay money to buy down the interest rate by paying points.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   So they walk in with one notion as to what they think is the best way to go,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   and they walk out doing something totally different.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So why does that work? Why is that option available?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And why would the bank offer that to them to allow them--explain what buying points are
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and why the bank allows that such that it reduces the costs?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So it's actually pretty simple.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   The bank doesn't keep the loan. They sell the loan off.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And there's a price in the industry we call it par, where if a bank sells a loan off,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   it's going to be fairly neutral for them.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And on a typical loan, the lender is going to earn typically somewhere in the vicinity of about 3%
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   of the loan amount when they sell the loan off.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   So what happens is that if the interest rate is higher than that,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   then the buyer of the mortgage will pay more for that mortgage.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And if the interest rate is lower than that, the buyer will pay less for that mortgage.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So the bottom line of this is that if the lender has--if you accept a higher interest rate,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   the lender's going to receive more profit on that.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And what they can do is they can use some of that profit to credit you for closing costs,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   points, origination fee, even title and escrow fees.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   If you want to earn--if you want to pay less in interest,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   then the bank can simply earn their profit by charging you points
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and then sell the loan off at--because it's a lower interest rate--
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   at whatever price the buyer is willing to pay for that loan.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Describe a scenario where somebody made a choice other than a 30-year fixed
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   and perhaps it was a better financial choice for them and why.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   So there's--on adjustable-rate mortgages, you have the option of different fixed periods initially.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So it could be a 5-year fixed or a 3-year fixed or a 7-year fixed,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   where that initial period, it's fixed for that period of time.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   So many folks, if they are pretty confident that they're only going to be in that home
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   for 5 years or 7 years, may choose to have a 7-year fixed.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And if they save, let's say, half a percent over the course of the first 7 years,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   what they've done is they've saved thousands of money,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   knowing--thousands of dollars of money--knowing that they're going to end up
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   selling the property before it turns into an adjustable-rate mortgage anyway.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   It's quite common in Silicon Valley because most of the engineers and high-tech folks
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   that work here end up with fairly large occasional windfall income from RSUs
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   or stock options or even bonuses.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And I've had quite a few clients who came in and said,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   "My intention is to actually pay this loan off in 7 years."
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And because the adjustable-rate mortgage offers a lower interest rate,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   they can pay it off faster and cheaper if they're fairly confident
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   they're going to be able to pay it off in only 7 years.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The fear with adjustable-rate mortgages is the potential for the mortgage
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   to adjust to crazy levels.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And this is the approach, say, "Well, wait a second.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   If I get an adjustable-rate mortgage and interest rates go up by 3%,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   all of a sudden my payment is going to be through the roof."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   How do you actually analyze an adjustable-rate mortgage to figure out
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   if that's the case or if there is a margin of safety?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Great question.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   It's very important to understand the terms of your adjustable-rate mortgage
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   before you accept one.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   The most important terms to remember are the index,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and this is going to be defined in your actual contract.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   An index is just simply a measurement of interest rates.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   What they'll do is they'll say, "We're going to base--
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   when we do adjust your interest rate, we're going to base it based on this index."
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   The most common index, and it's one probably most folks have heard of,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   is LIBOR.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   That's just simply a measure of where interest rates are at any given point in time,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   just like the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a measure of where stocks might be
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   at any point in time.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Then in your contract, they're also going to define the margin.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Now, a typical margin on a LIBOR loan is going to be between 2.25 to 2.75.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   So you want to look at that margin, and what it says is when we adjust,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   we're going to take whatever the current value of the index is,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and we're going to add the margin.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   So if the index, let's just say, is 1% and your margin is 2.25%,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   your new interest rate will be 3.25%.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   The reason that this becomes important is today LIBOR is running under 1%.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   So folks who have an adjustable-rate mortgage that is adjusting today
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   are finding that their loan is adjusting out to lower than where fixed-rate loans are,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   so it's not exploding at all.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   The other elements that you really need to understand are your caps,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   which is the cap on how high the interest rate can go,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   and there's three caps that are really important.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   There's an initial rate cap.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   So if you have, let's say, a 5-1 arm that's fixed for five years,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   at the end of five years, then your loan can be adjusted a maximum of either 2%
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   or what's more common now, 5%.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Then you have an annual adjustment, and that's always 2%.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And then you have a lifetime cap, which is today in most cases 5% over the start rate.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So it's really important to understand those five terms whenever you're looking at
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   an adjustable-rate mortgage.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   If you're comparing offers, for instance, you should be asking all five of those questions
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   and understand exactly how it's going to adjust.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I had a family member recently, as in the last few days, who's saying,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   "Okay, I need to refinance my house, and where do I go?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Who do I start with?"
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   How would you advise somebody who is looking at their house saying,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   "I'd like to refinance," and trying to figure out how to approach finding somebody
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   to work with?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   How would you advise someone in that situation?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I think the best way to do it is to start online just so that you educate yourself
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   a little bit and understand where the various products are.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   And then really write down, figure out what your real goal is in refinancing
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   because there's a lot of different reasons to refinance.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And when you actually go speak to someone--I'm a brick-and-mortar guy.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I prefer working with somebody that I can meet face-to-face and look them in the eye,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and that way I get a feel for whether or not they're being honest and ethical.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   So I would educate--as a consumer, I would educate myself first, figure out why I want
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   to refinance, and then find somebody local, somebody who's referred by a family member
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   or a friend that you trust would be ideal, and ask them sharp questions.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   You have the right to ask a lot of questions about why they're recommending
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   whatever they're recommending and about whether or not it's really going to be
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   beneficial for you.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Is there a way to know which is the cheaper option, working with a bank,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   working with a broker?
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   How do you deal with that situation?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   A lot of it depends on the circumstances.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Generally, we all get our money from the same pool.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Ninety percent, roughly, of all loans made today are sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   At any given day and in any given moment of time, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   actually advertise what they're willing to pay for loans that are going to be
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   delivered 60 days from now.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   So the differences between most lenders are fairly small.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   The reason there are some differences is some lenders strategically go for the
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   lowest possible cost.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Some lenders go for offering the best service.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And also, if a lender has been slow over the course of the month, then oftentimes
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   they will narrow their margin a little bit just to fill their pipeline a little bit.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   So it's worth shopping.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   In my experience, brokers have a lower overhead cost and can usually do a better
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   job, especially on conforming loans that are sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   which would be loans under $417,000 to prime borrowers.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Usually, a broker can give you a better deal, but I still think it's worth
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   shopping and comparing.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   It's a challenge.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I know even here in my local market, when I took out a mortgage on the house that
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I bought, looking back at it, the process went fine, but I never was confident
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   that the lender knew all the little tricks.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And what was the biggest frustration for me was I found out six months after I
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   bought the house about the Florida Mortgage Credit Certificate Program.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And I found out that the house that I purchased and the terms, I would have
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   qualified for the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, which was a bonus tax
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   credit on top of all of the normal tax deductions that people are aware of.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And it was free money that if somebody had just told me about it, I could have
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   gotten and it would have been several thousand dollars a year, but except I had
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   to do it in advance.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And I just remember being so frustrated with the fact that the broker didn't
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   tell me about it, the real estate agent didn't tell me about it, the broker
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   didn't tell me about it.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I was just incredibly frustrated and I was like, "Do you guys not do your job?"
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And even just in terms of the options, I never found a broker who was willing to
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   sit down and say, "Let me talk you through the options."
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Rather, what happened was, "Well, here's a standard 30-rate fix and here are
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   the three companies," and boom.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And I was looking for more of someone to say, "Let's look through your situation
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   and look at the options."
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Nobody presented to me a few different adjustable-rate mortgage options and
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   explained to me, "Here are the risks and here are the advantages and here's the
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   price over the holding period."
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I found it to be a very frustrating experience and I've not known how to
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   advise people to get a better experience.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Well, and that's a good question.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   I think as a consumer, what you have to do is you have to be ready, willing, and
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   able to shop and talk to different people until you find somebody that you're
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   pretty confident will do that.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   One of the tricks about going to the real estate agent, if you're purchasing a
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   home and your real estate agent is steering you towards a particular lender,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   which is very, very common, we work as partners with real estate agents.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   One of the challenges to that is that it's in everyone's interest except yours to
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   make the deal as smooth and effortless as possible because that gets us to
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   close faster so everybody gets paid sooner and more reliably because the longer
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   a deal is in escrow, the more chances there are for it to fall apart for any
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   reason, for some reason.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   So what you're going to find is complicated elements like the mortgage credit
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   certificate program are rarely brought up at that point in the process because,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   quite frankly, it adds a lot of complexity and a lot of time to the process of
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   getting your loan approved and through the system.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   So my advice is if you educate yourself and understand that you have the right to
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   understand a bunch of different options, then find somebody who's willing to
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   present you with at least three different options.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   - Right.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Yeah, as with anything, I can't blame other people for my lack of homework.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   It's just I wasn't aware of it.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   But it definitely – it just seems like in so many industries, I'm sure in the
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   service industry too, it should be pretty easy to stand out.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   But you got to bring value.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   So let's talk about types of loans.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   I'd like you to give just an overview, a few minutes of discussion of each of the
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   types of loans and thinking about what to do and how to approach it.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I want to start with the one that's abnormal but I get a lot of questions about
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   reverse mortgages.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Explain what a reverse mortgage is and how to approach the decision of whether or
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   not you should take one out.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   - Okay.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   A reverse mortgage is simply a mortgage where you do not have to make the
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   mortgage payments.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   The interest on the loan accrues and simply eats into your equity on the
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   property.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   So it's for older folks who do not have enough income to live.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And there's four different ways that a reverse mortgage can be structured.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And very briefly, one is just simply a lump sum payment.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And that's an ideal situation for someone who has a relatively large mortgage.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   They're having difficulty making the payment.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   They can get a one-time lump sum reverse mortgage which pays that off.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And then from then on, they simply have no mortgage payments at all.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   There's also one where you get payments for your lifetime.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So you get monthly payments for as long as you live.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   That's ideal for someone who has a little bit more equity in their property and
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   needs basically supplemental monthly income in order to be able to just live
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   life normally and have a nice life.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   The third is set up as an equity line.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And the equity line is perfect for folks that are okay on a monthly basis but
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   have occasional needs.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And a good example is a couple that I worked with where the husband had a
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   stroke.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So all of a sudden, they had some large medical bills.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And they were fine except for that.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   So they used an equity line but they ran it all the way up to the limit and
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   they were not qualified to increase that limit.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And they were looking at large medical bills that they simply couldn't pay
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   but a tremendous amount of equity in their home.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   So we set up a reverse mortgage to pay off the equity line and then give them
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   -- to pay off the existing equity line and then give them another equity line
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   or let's just say it's all one loan but they had enough room to be able to draw
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   off money whenever they needed it for medical expenses.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And they would never have to make a payment for the rest of their life.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   So it allowed them to stay in the home for as long as they wanted.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So the point here and I flipped it just in hopes of keeping the conversation
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   interesting but I may have made it more confusing.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   The point of a reverse mortgage is to take equity that you own out of a house
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and basically give it away to the bank in exchange for money now in one of those
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   forms.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So this is the exact opposite of a mainstream mortgage.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   You see the value but you also see some dangers.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   So what would be -- what are some reasons why people would choose not to get a
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   reverse mortgage?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Well, it is the most expensive mortgage available and that's because virtually
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   all reverse mortgages today are FHA insured and that FHA insurance is fairly
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   expensive.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   So the rest of the costs are more or less the same as a forward mortgage or
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   conventional mortgage.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   But on the reverse mortgage, what we find is that you have -- it's a very,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   very high cost mortgage.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   The second thing is it does eat up your equity.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   So if you have concerns about that, if you have children that you want to leave
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   your property to, you'll have less equity when you're ready to leave that to
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   your children than you would if you didn't do the reverse mortgage.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Reverse mortgages today are designed so that it would be virtually impossible to
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   eat up 100% of your equity but not completely impossible.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   So there is some risk there as well.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   And then finally, the last bit is the -- the last thing that's important is that
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   the reverse mortgage is still the one product that the -- where the lender can
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   actually earn more money by selling you a higher interest rate.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   On all other products, especially for brokers, we're unable to increase our
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   revenue in any way.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   We have to make the exact same amount on everything.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   That rule doesn't apply to banks and mortgage bankers, large mortgage
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   bankers, but it applies to brokers.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   With reverse mortgages, you can actually earn huge incomes by selling a very
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   high interest rate.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   And because the consumer doesn't make any payments, often they don't actually
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   care or they don't know that they care.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   So it's sort of a little trap that's important to understand so that you can
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   avoid it if you're actually shopping for a reverse mortgage.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   - Are the costs of mortgages declining, meaning as they've become more popular,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   is the cost of insurance declining and is the cost of taking out the mortgage
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   declining at all?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   - In terms of the reverse mortgage?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   - Yes.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   - Yes.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   The upfront cost of a reverse mortgage declined this year.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   FHA sets the insurance premium and it declined this year.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And now it's down, your upfront premium is down to one-half of 1% of the value
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   of your home.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And it was at one point as much as 2.5%.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   So in virtually all cases, there's some exceptions, but in virtually all cases
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   today, the upfront insurance is actually considerably less than what it used to be.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   - That's what has confused me about the reverse mortgage market, and I'm not in
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   it every day, but it just seems to me that it's a useful tool and you've got to
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   analyze it each time, but the prices shouldn't remain high forever.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Like there should be competition and there should be reasons why the prices
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   would be declining.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So yes, when it was a newer product, I could understand why the costs would be
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   high, but I'd like to see it coming down and being possible.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I want to transition.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   I want to describe a scenario and you can tell me what's available in the market
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   today.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And this is the thing I've kind of puzzled over.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   But in my ideal world, if I were a traditional retiree, say 65-ish, whatever,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I would, and assuming most people today, the concept of the family house that the
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   kids want to inherit is for most people dead and gone.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Maybe that was the case when you had the family farmstead and your kids were going
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   to take over.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   But today, most of us, the houses we live in are a commodity.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   They're nice, but it's not like we're going to pass them on through the
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   generations.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   So most of the time, if I die and leave behind a house to my 45-year-old kids,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   they just got to go through the hassle of selling it and getting rid of it.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And they just got to deal with that and then they split up the money.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   So in some ways, my ideal scenario if I were a retiree would be to have either a
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   rental house, which is less than normal because of the risks there.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Most retirees aren't willing to face the prospect of a landlord adjusting things
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   on them.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   But I'd like to have either a maximum interest only mortgage or some way set up
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   with maybe a reverse mortgage where I don't own the property.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   I just simply live in the property and I have a maximum mortgage on it possible so
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   that my assets are somewhere else that's a little bit easier to deal with than a
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   personal house, but minimum payments possible and to do that for the longest
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   period possible.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   If you get the scenario, what would be the best way to set that up if I were going
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   to try to accomplish that?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Would it be through using a reverse mortgage product?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Would it be through an interest only loan of some kind?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   How would I set that up in today, 2015, 2016?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Just to clarify, so one of your goals is to not make payments or just you don't
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   really care whether you're leaving equity or not?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I have enough money.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   I don't care about equity.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I want to strip the equity out of the house.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   So $300,000 house, I want the maximum equity out of the house.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And I'm willing to make payments, but I don't want to make principal payments if
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   possible.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I want to make minimum payments.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   It's not a problem to make some payments, but I want to make either minimum
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   payments or no payments.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Well, an interest only loan would be significantly cheaper.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   As a matter of fact, an equity line would actually be, by far and away, the least
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   expensive way to do that.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And with an equity line, you can certainly get -- with a conventional equity line,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   you can get significantly more money out of your property than you could with a
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   reverse mortgage.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So -- oh, go ahead.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   No, so then I would take the maximum equity line out and just pay the interest
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   payments on that line on an ongoing basis?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Yes.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   And the only caveat to that would be that within 10 years, usually exactly 10
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   years, the equity line draw period will be over.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   And so you'll have to change your strategy at that point.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And possibly you could refinance if you still qualify.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   You could just roll it into a new equity line.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Or at that point, you could go out and get a reverse mortgage, too.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Interesting.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And could -- in an equity line, can they lower -- I guess it would depend on the
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   terms of the contract, but wouldn't it be normal that they could lower the amount
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   of the line and forced repayment of some kind?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   They can.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   But historically, the only time that's happened is when we saw large declines in
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   the value of the homes back in 2008, 2009.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Okay.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Because I know that's something that I did see happen with some clients.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I was just asking you because you're a creative thinker and it's a scenario
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   that I've changed my tune on.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And the basic scenario has been this.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   I used to think that the goal for a retiree would be to have a paid off home
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   mortgage, that this is the ideal scenario, have a paid off home mortgage and then
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   eliminate the risk.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   But what I've realized is when you're living off of the investment income from a
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   portfolio, you don't have the same risk that somebody who's living off of the
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   income from wages has.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   So for me, I'm 30 years old, it would be very valuable to have a paid for house.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And I'm not saying that if I had abundant other money that at 65, if I had a paid
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   off house from 30 to 65 that I'd go borrow money on it.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   I might not.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   But I would consider it because if I'm living on a portfolio of income, then by
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   definition I have income and I no longer have -- the mortgage is just a cost of
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   financing.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And houses are really clumsy as far as passing along generationally.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And so I've looked for strategies to say, "What's the best way to cut the cost
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   down on this thing?"
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   So I've really looked for ways to do that.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   So that was the scenario.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Walk through some of the different options.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   So in your book, you talk about fixed rate mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   interest only loans, option arms, private money, second mortgages, and equity
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   lines.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Let's walk through those options.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And if you were approaching it, what are the pros and cons that an individual
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   borrower would need to understand when thinking through their decisions?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   So what I like to do is I like to start off with finding out what a borrower's
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   goals are.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Most borrowers will say their goal is to have the lowest interest rate possible.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   But that doesn't really tell me a lot.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   What I need to know and what they need to know is, you know, are you looking for
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   the lowest monthly payment, the lowest upfront cost, the lowest lifetime cost,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   or do you want to pay it off as fast as possible, or something else.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   But it's usually one of those four things that becomes most important to them.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   So that's the first thing I look at.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   With a 30-year fixed mortgage, obviously the greatest advantage is the interest
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   rate's never going to change, your payment's never going to change.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   It's a very secure mortgage.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   But it is the most expensive mortgage out there, unless in the future interest
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   rates just go through the roof.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And given the fact that in the last 20 years they've been extremely low,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   maybe the odds of them going through the roof are not that high.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   The adjustable-rate mortgages we've kind of already touched on,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   the greatest advantage to them is they're significantly less expensive,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   at least for the fixed period.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And as it turns out, over the last 10 years they've been significantly
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   cheaper even after they begin adjusting, as long as it's not one of the
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   toxic adjustable-rate mortgages.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Option arms are no longer an option today.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   There was actually nothing wrong with the product.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Unfortunately, they were sold improperly to people that shouldn't have had them.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   And so those are considered toxic loan products today,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   and they're not available, so that's kind of off the table.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And then private money is very expensive.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   You would only use that if you can't qualify in any other way.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   But I think for each person individually what they have to figure out is what
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   really is their goal.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And then I do take a look at their income and spending profile.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   If somebody has abundant disposable income, for instance,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   some folks are really conservative and instead of spending 40% of their gross
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   income on housing debt, they only want to spend 30% or something.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Or if they have large bonuses or stock options, RSUs,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   somebody with those kinds of income profiles usually have a higher risk
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   tolerance, so doing something like an interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   could be a really good option for them.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   If someone has really thin disposable income,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   like they're really stretching out their qualifying and they're qualifying for
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   as much house as they can possibly buy, or if they have bad spending habits,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   they've got a lot of credit card debt,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   that tells me that they're likely to continue spending and they could get into
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   trouble.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Or if they have uncertain employment.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   I mean, here in Silicon Valley we have a lot of layoffs,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   and certain companies are more prone to it than others, for instance.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Well, if someone has those elements in their income and spending profile,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I would say they'd have a lower risk tolerance and I would be more inclined to
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   recommend a fixed-rate loan for someone like that.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   You work in an interesting mortgage environment.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   I mean, again, Silicon Valley.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   So you're not dealing with somebody in the Midwest who's taken out a $75,000
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   mortgage.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   You're more likely to be working with a $750,000 mortgage.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   How does that affect the mortgage decision process?
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Well, the bigger the mortgage, the bigger the risk/reward equation becomes.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   So it's a great point if someone's got a $75,000 mortgage in the Midwest,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   their savings potential from getting an adjustable-rate mortgage is really
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   very small, as is the risk if it begins to adjust.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   With a $750,000 loan, which isn't uncommon at all here,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   you can save tens of thousands of dollars over the next seven years is a
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   typical period for what people kind of look at here because they figure they'll
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   be moving up within seven years or paying it off.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And you've got tens of thousands of dollars in potential savings and
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   significantly greater risk unless you manage it properly.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And the best way to manage risk on an adjustable-rate mortgage is to have a
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   plan to pay the balance down as fast as possible because,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   just like with a Midwest person, the lower the principal balance when it
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   begins to adjust, the lower the impact is if interest rates happen to go way up.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I love my favorite chapter in your book is Chapter 19,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and I'd recommend listeners buy it if for no other reason than just to get
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Chapter 19 where you talk through the money-saving strategies.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   And you walk through these scenarios step by step.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   So you talk about the holding period, just like you're doing just now.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   If you're going to hold the house for longer, do this.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   If you're going to hold the house for shorter, do this.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   You walk through the life stage and the different products and price
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   recommendations for life stages, risk tolerance.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   You even have a section on if you're going to have babies, having a baby.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   If you're going to have a baby -- and here I'll read just -- this is the
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   shortest one.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   But if you're going to have a baby and lose one income for a while,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   get an adjustable-rate mortgage with an initial fixed period that is longer
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   than the time you want to spend at home.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   If you think you want to stay at home indefinitely, get a fixed-rate
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   mortgage.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And if you decide you want to have lots of babies, you may want to consider
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   the possibility that you'll want to add on to your house in a few years.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   If this is the case, then now might be a good time for an adjustable-rate
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   mortgage.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   When the time comes to build on, you're very likely to refinance again to
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   pay for an addition.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And you go on and give these examples for each one.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   In my mind, this is the whole key.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   This is a really important aspect of financial planning.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   And listeners would be well-served to pick up your book and work through
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   those situations.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Because as mortgage costs are going to be a big deal for you in the grand
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   scope of your life and in your life plan, it's important to get them right.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Well, exactly.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   And all of the elements that I discussed in Chapter 19, every one of them
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   reflects a real-life client situation that I had.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And the more somebody talks to me about, "Here's what I'm thinking about
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   doing," the more we can sit down and talk about how the various options are
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   going to impact them.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   A good example is somebody that wants to start a business, because that's
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   really common.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And someone that wants to start a business, for God's sake, get a fixed-rate
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   mortgage and make sure you get it before you start your business.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Because once you start your business, you will not be financiable for at
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   least three years.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   So it's just little things like that.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Talk to your mortgage advisor about your plans and make sure that they are
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   part of the consideration in terms of your strategy.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Why get a fixed-rate mortgage in that context?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Explain that scenario.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Well, because I guess it depends on the time frame.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   But the main reason I would say get a fixed-rate mortgage if you're about to
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   start your own business is businesses, when you first start them, have a way
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   of sucking up a lot of cash.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And sometimes it takes a long time before you're actually generating any
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   income.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   So your risk tolerance on a mortgage might be significantly lower if you're
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   about to go into the self-employment world.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   - Yeah.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   It's amazing how no matter how hard you try to predict the future,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   things can change.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And my final question, and I'll give you a longer intro to it,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   my final question is, do you have some strategies to create maximum
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   flexibility for people and minimum cost?
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And I'll explain the scenario.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   As we record this, we're recording this on December 1, 2015.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   This will likely air either later in December or in January.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Hopefully, by the time we record this, I will have sold the house that I bought
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   a few years ago.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   But when I bought that house, I chose the house very, very carefully.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   I didn't intend to do a short-term house.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   I didn't intend to do a -- it wasn't intended to be a starter house.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   It was intended to be a long-time house.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   I didn't have any reason why I didn't expect to be in that house for 20,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   30 years, 40 years, who knows.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   I bought a house that was big enough.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   I would be happy in it for a long time, nice enough and be happy,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   but not so big.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Without going through the whole list, I chose the house really carefully.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And I intended to make a -- I made a 20% down payment.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I got a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   I was intending it to be the long play.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Well, a year after I bought the house,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   I wound up completely changing everything,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   deciding to close the business I'd been running for five or six years
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   and start Radical Personal Finance, which adjusted everything.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   I had no need to live in the neighborhood where I wanted to live.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   I wanted my money back out of the house, et cetera,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   and I looked at different strategies and ultimately decided to just go ahead
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   and sell the house.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   And so what was funny is I've ended up owning the house,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   and there were some timing strategies as well.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   I had some -- it's a good time to sell as far as assuming the contract goes
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   through as planned.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   I'll have made a healthy profit on the house and some kind of timing the
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   market a little bit to take some tax-free income as well.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   But all of my plans -- I'm glad that I had some flexibility because even
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   though I had my plan set in one way, life changed.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   And I couldn't have anticipated that.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   So the question is do you have some suggestions and strategies that would
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   help listeners always keep flexibility so that no matter how much they're
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   planning, if their circumstances do indeed change -- they do what I did,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   they start a business, they decide to move to another state to take a better
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   job, et cetera -- that they have more options?
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Any suggestions for them?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Sure.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   One of the things that I like to do -- I work with financial planners a lot
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   where we kind of partner on strategy and we sit down and kind of think about
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   things.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   And financial planners that I work with tend to really like the idea of
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   having an equity line, which provides a tremendous amount of flexibility.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   So it's not uncommon for us to use two different loans for financing a
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   property, whether it's a refinance or a purchase, especially if there's a
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   break at which your first mortgage becomes quite a bit cheaper because it's
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   in a certain category, in which case we could limit that and we use the rest
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   as an equity line.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Or sometimes we just refinance your mortgage into the lowest rate possible.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   But then add an equity line on top of that.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Because the equity line, essentially if you're not using it, doesn't cost you
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   anything.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   But provides you with a great deal of flexibility.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   So I think the first thing I would say is in your situation is consider having
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   two loans, which means that you've got access to cash, especially if you're
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   starting a business, where you have quick access to cash.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Another probably very important consideration would be is if you end up
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   owning two homes, I'm not sure if you were going there or not, but if you end
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   up owning two homes, I like diversification in my debt portfolio as much as I do
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   in my investment portfolio.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   So it might be a really good idea to have one fixed loan and one variable rate
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   loan so that if rates go up, you're protected on one.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   If rates go down, you get the benefit on the other.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   - That's an interesting approach.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   I hadn't considered that.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   No, I went from owning to renting.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   I was able to find a rental deal that worked.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   But that's an interesting approach to consider to diversifying that.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Are there other approaches?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Let's say that I were a real estate investor with a portfolio of loans.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Are there other approaches to intelligent diversification that you would consider
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   on managing rental properties?
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   - Well, I do own rental properties.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   That's a good question.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   What do you have in mind?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   - I guess I'm just thinking my scenario of real estate investment is borrow a
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   million dollars and let your tenants pay it off.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   So if you don't manage, however, your risks carefully on that million bucks,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   it'll sink you.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   And so as you're working into it, you've got to build safety for yourself.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   You've got to build flexibility.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   And if you're starting without a ton of money, you're going to be borrowing a
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   good amount of money.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   And so you're going to be steadily managing your properties and kind of
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   adjusting your financing.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   And I just was curious if you had any big picture suggestions.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   - Well, you hit the nail on the head with regards to risk.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   I mean, you have no idea with a rental property how much it's going to throw off
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   every month.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   In the long run, you can make some fairly accurate projections most of the time.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   But on a month-by-month basis, you just never know.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   So an excellent strategy there is to start off with an interest-only
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   adjustable-rate mortgage.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   For instance, a 711 arm that's adjustable for...or that's interest-only for 10
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   years.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And the reason that that might work is that you have the option of making a
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   minimum payment for those first 10 years.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   So you save a little bit of money because it's an adjustable-rate mortgage.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   And what you do is when the property is performing well and throwing off a lot
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   of cash, you use that cash to buy down the principal as fast as you can in order
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   to mitigate any risk that you have once it begins to adjust.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   But then if you have a bad month, you know, the property is vacant for a month
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   or requires a lot of repairs, you can make just the minimum payment,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   which is going to be only whatever interest is due for that month.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   So it's a way of reducing your cost and reducing your risk,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   or at least your monthly risk, at the same time.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   If that's your strategy, however, I certainly wouldn't finance all your
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   properties using the same thing only because at some point the loans begin
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   to adjust.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   And once they do begin to adjust, if the rates have gone up,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   all of a sudden what you've done is you've converted all of your debt
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   into extremely expensive debt.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Right.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   High risk.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Well, Casey, thank you so much for sharing some of your insights and wisdom
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   with the audience.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   The book is definitely a great book.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   If you're going to buy a house, I definitely recommend reading the book.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   It's called "The Loan Guide."
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   I'll link to it in the blog post for today's show and in the show notes
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   on your phone.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   And then you also blog and have a site at LoanGuide.com.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Do you work with clients across -- you said you prefer to work locally.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   Do you work with clients across the country or just primarily in California?
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   I work only in California.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Licensing today is state by state, and I am only licensed in California.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   Our company is licensed in several other states as well,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   but I personally work only with California clients,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   but anywhere in California.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   I regularly finance all over the state.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Great.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Well, any California listeners would definitely encourage them.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Check out LoanGuide.com, and if you're looking for a good broker, talk to Casey,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   and you can provide the same kind of personalized advice that we all wish that we had.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Anywhere else that you want people to connect with you or any final words of advice, Casey?
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   No, as far as connecting, the best way to reach me is through LoanGuide.com,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   and the final words of advice I think are don't be afraid to shop,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   don't be afraid to ask sharp questions.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Many of the loan officers you talk to don't know any more than you do,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   so do not be intimidated by them and hold their feet to the fire.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Sounds like the insurance industry, sounds like the investments industry.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   We're all the same.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   Yes, it does.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   All the same.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Well, Casey, thanks for coming on the show today.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Thanks so much for having me, Joshua.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   It was a pleasure.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   As we go today, I encourage you to check out Casey's book,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   and I encourage you to think deeply and always look for a way of optimizing your scenario.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   I don't know what's right for you.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   Every decision has pros and cons, and that's not just some random disclaimer.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   I killed all the stupid disclaimers.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   You've got to figure out your situation.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Guess what?
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   It's your money, it's your life, and you are responsible.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   You're the one who's going to sign on the dotted line,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   so do a little research before you sign
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   and make sure that you have a little bit of a sense of what's going on.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   Buying a book, let's see, on Amazon right now, this book is $25.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Paperback, shippable with Amazon Prime, $25.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   15 used from 1881, I wouldn't bother with those.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   There's not enough of a savings there.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   But $25 might be worth investing in for an education
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   that will impact the potential expenditure or savings of thousands,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   on the cost of your next mortgage.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Do a little research.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Become a person who researches things intensely.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   You can't always be successful at always making the right decision.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   We all make mistakes.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   But at least be somebody who does your best to do research.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   I encourage you to do that.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Don't make big financial decisions without spending time
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   and spending a little bit of money on your education.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Definitely encourage you to get Jake Casey's book.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Books are going to be the best investment you're going to make.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   $25 in, plus shipping if you don't have Amazon Prime
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   or wherever you buy your books.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   $25 in and thousands of dollars of potential savings out.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   I'll take that trade any day.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   So, Casey, thanks for coming on the show.
