[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Today, I'm going to show you how to track and analyze your LLMs using the Weights & Biases
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.360]   Prompts Tracer.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.760]   Once you've logged your LLM chain output using WNB Tracer, you'll have this tracer view.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.380]   The table at the top gives you high-level information about what you've logged, such
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.860]   as whether the chain was successful, the inputs and outputs of the chain, what the main components
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.640]   of the chain are, any errors that occurred in the chain.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.120]   Now, when we click different rows in the table, we can see the trace timeline view update
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.480]   with more details.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.880]   Here we see the entire execution trace of the chain, as well as all of the component
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.520]   chains, LLMs, and tools used.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.880]   Clicking on a component shows more information about the inputs and outputs, as well as metadata,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.320]   such as how many tokens were used.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.120]   If your chain failed, the component that failed will be highlighted.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.240]   You can check the inputs to that component and try and debug what went wrong.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.240]   Finally, the model architecture tab shows the full config of your chain.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.480]   Here you can see what LLM model was used, which prompt template was used, and much more.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.280]   That's it!
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.560]   Now you can see the full overview of your LLM chain and quickly debug when things go
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.000]   wrong.
