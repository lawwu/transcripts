[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:17.920]   the Gospel according to St. Luke, in chapter 13, verses 34 and 35.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:30.800]   In the 13th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680]   killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.960]   gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:52.240]   not; behold, your house is left unto you desolate, and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.920]   me until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:20.000]   Lord." These undoubtedly are the saddest words that were ever spoken by our blessed
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.400]   Lord and Savior. They are his lament over the city of Jerusalem, over its people, its
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.720]   common people who cried, "Away with him, crucify him," and desired that a robber called
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.400]   Barabbas should be set free to them instead of the Lord. They are spoken with respect
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.600]   to all the great religious leaders and rulers, the Pharisees and scribes, the Sadducees,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.280]   the doctors of the law, the Herodians, and all who are in positions and places of authority
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:10.520]   and power. Our Lord here expresses this lament with regard to the city. You remember how
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.840]   he came to do so. We were considering it partly last Sunday evening. You remember that the
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.120]   Pharisees came unto him saying, "Get thee out, and depart hence, for Herod will kill
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.520]   thee." And he replied, saying, "Go and tell that fox, behold, I cast out devils,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected. Nevertheless,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.080]   I must walk today and tomorrow, and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.280]   perish out of Jerusalem." You remember that we saw that he had been prophesying that his
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.840]   death was to take place there in Jerusalem, not in Herod's territory. There was no danger
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.800]   of that. He knew that he was to be tried and condemned in Jerusalem, and then crucified
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.080]   outside the city wall. And having that in his mind, he goes on to utter this lament,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.200]   "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.840]   thee! How often would I have gathered thy children as a hen doth gather her brood under
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:35.440]   her wings, and ye would not!" In other words, what our Lord is doing here is to deal with
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.800]   this whole question of the attitude of men and women towards himself. If you like, we
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:53.000]   can say that in these verses he is summing up his own mission, the purpose of his coming
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.760]   into this world. He is reminding them of what the mission was, the reason, the purpose for
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.440]   his coming. And he also reminds them of the reception which he received.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.760]   Now in the Gospel of John you will find all that in the introduction. John puts it into
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.720]   the prologue, "He came unto his own, and his own received him not." Now our Lord is
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:31.000]   saying that very thing here and putting it in terms of his rejection in this way, especially
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.640]   by the citizens of Jerusalem and by the leaders especially of the people. Therefore it is
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.680]   a very convenient way of considering together what the Gospel of Jesus Christ really is
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:56.800]   and what it has to say. Our Lord, you will notice, represents it here as an offer. He
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.400]   says that he has come into the world to confront men and women with a choice. "How often
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.840]   would I have gathered?" But you would not. He stands before them, he says, as one who
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.200]   has come on a mission and he is offering them something. And the whole question is, what
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.560]   are they doing with, what are they making of the offer? He knows full well at this stage
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.760]   in his ministry that he is to be rejected by these people in Jerusalem. Now that, my
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.200]   dear friends, is precisely the position still. This is the very business and purpose of the
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.880]   preaching of the Christian Gospel. It is to confront men and women with this offer, with
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:58.360]   this choice. Every preaching of the Gospel worthy of the name does that. It is to hold
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:06.920]   Jesus Christ before men and women and his offer, and to confront them with a choice.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.880]   That is the Gospel. That is the message of the Gospel. That is Christian preaching, nothing
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:21.920]   else. This is, we are ambassadors for Christ. And we plead with you in God's stead and
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:29.480]   in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. Now, our Lord makes that very plain here.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.320]   This is his own summary of his mission, of his purpose in coming into the world. That
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.840]   is what he has come to do. And he makes another thing equally plain and clear, doesn't he?
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:50.000]   That there are only two possible attitudes towards this. One is to accept, the other
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.120]   is to refuse. There is no other possibility at all. There is no such thing as neutrality.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.040]   Not to accept an offer is to refuse the offer. There is no middle position between those
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:15.000]   two. You cannot think of it. It is quite inconceivable. Confronted by an offer like this, Isaiah,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.080]   we are left in one of these two positions. Either we have gladly received it, or we have
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:26.840]   spurned it, we have rejected it. He makes that, I say, equally plain and clear. And
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:34.320]   it is my business to remind you this evening that the position is still the same.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:43.160]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is here making this self-same offer. And every one of us
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:54.000]   in this congregation has either accepted it, or else we have rejected it. And every one
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.280]   of us is in one or the other of those two positions.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:08.880]   Now the question is, had we realized that? Because, I say again, not to accept is to
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.560]   refuse. "Ah, but," you say, "I've never thought of it very well. You haven't accepted
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:23.880]   it." It is one or the other of these two. I wonder whether we realize further what all
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:32.120]   that means and what all that involves. Well, thank God our Lord himself shows us here very
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:43.400]   plainly what it means. He analyzes and shows the terrible truth about unbelief. He does
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.720]   it in terms primarily of these people of Jerusalem, but as I say, what he says about them is equally
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:55.440]   true of all others. They are just a glaring example, the most striking illustration of
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:02.240]   all. But what was true of them is equally true of all others who do not believe in him.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:10.600]   Here then, I say, we have our Lord's own analysis of unbelief. He tells us very plainly and
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.400]   clearly the truth about anybody tonight who is not a Christian, who has heard this gospel
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   but who does not believe it. And it is, I say, because it is such a solemn and a terrible,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:34.040]   such a tragic thing, that I am holding it before you. "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem."
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:43.720]   Do you hear the tragedy in those words? Can you hear this note of lament? Can you get
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:51.120]   this accent in the very utterance of the Son of God? This is to him the final tragedy.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:57.320]   There's nothing worse than this, nothing more terrible than this, that these people of Jerusalem
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.360]   amongst whom he had appeared and to whom he made this wonderful offer, that they should
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:11.080]   have rejected him, and he would not. It's the final tragedy, but not only of them, but
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.840]   I say, of all, in all ages, at all times, and in all places, who having been confronted
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.280]   by him and the offer of his gospel, reject it and refuse it and won't have it.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   Well, now then, let's follow his analysis. The first matter, surely, that should engage
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   our attention is this. Why do they refuse him? And he would not. Why did they treat
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:53.560]   him thus? Well, he says, the answer is, this is an old story. There's nothing new about
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.680]   this, he says. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, you've always done
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:07.760]   that, and always have stirred them that are sent unto you. That's been your long and sad
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:16.240]   story. In other words, he's giving there a summary of the history of the Old Testament.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.440]   You had another more extended summary of it in that portion of the speech of Stephen at
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.560]   his trial, which I read at the beginning out of the seventh chapter of the book of the
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.240]   Acts of the Apostles. That's the point that Stephen was making from beginning to end.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.960]   He says, you know, in arresting me and threatening to kill me, you're only doing what you've
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:41.440]   done recently to the Son of God, but you're simply repeating and reenacting what our forefathers
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.840]   have always done. They did it with Moses. They've done it with all the prophets. That's
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:55.040]   the story. Stiff-necked, resisting the Holy Ghost. That's always been our history, says
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.800]   Stephen to his fellow countrymen. And our Lord reminds them of the same thing here.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.960]   He says, you've always done that. You've killed your prophets. You've stoned them that have
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:13.160]   been sent to you by God. You're just keeping up the reputation which, as a race and a people,
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.280]   you have gained throughout the centuries. That was the story, alas, of the children
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:27.480]   of Israel. And here he's reminding them of the kind of coping stone of this terrible
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.520]   building that they've erected. They're now going to reject and crucify their own Messiah,
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.080]   the very Son of God. They've murdered his servants throughout the centuries, one after
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:46.680]   another. They're now going to murder the Son. But let us not fail to observe this, my dear
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:56.080]   friends. This is the story of the whole of the human race. This is the story of man.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.240]   You see, the children of Israel are just a great object, listen. But what is true of
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.080]   them is still more true of the remainder of mankind. What is the story of the human race?
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:12.240]   Isn't it this? God making men, putting him into a position of perfection in a place called
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:23.040]   paradise. And what does man do? He turns his back on God, rebels against God, rejects God,
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.680]   feels he can get on without God. The God who had blessed him, showered his blessings upon
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.280]   him, rejects all his overtures. That's what the human race has been doing ever since it
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.520]   fell. That's the position tonight of any man who doesn't believe in God and who isn't a
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:50.040]   Christian. It's just this same process of rejecting God and saying no to all his gracious
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:58.960]   offers and invitations. Why does mankind behave like this? Well, our Lord tells us the answer
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.640]   in terms of these people in Jerusalem. It's true of us all by nature. He says the reason
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:12.120]   is you would not. What he means is this, you see, that the trouble is down in the realm
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:20.160]   of the will and in the realm of the heart. You would not. You refused, deliberately,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.280]   obstinately. In other words, the point I'm making is this, that the essential cause of
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.680]   this trouble is not a matter which is intellectual, primarily. It's not a matter of the mind.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:38.360]   It's much deeper than that. Oh, I know that men and women try to say that their rejection
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.760]   of Christianity is entirely in terms of their minds and their intellects. I'm constantly
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.040]   referring to this and showing how utterly ridiculous it is. We prove that very simply
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.240]   like this, that if you could establish the case or the fact that any man who's a Christian
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.720]   is therefore of necessity, a man who has no intellect or no mind and cannot think, well,
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.440]   then you'd have a case for your argument. But the simple fact is that throughout the
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:09.720]   centuries there have been men of great intellect and vital ability who have believed the gospel.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.060]   There have been men with equal intellect who have rejected it. It isn't a matter of intellect.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.840]   So don't run away with the notion that you're not a Christian simply because you've got
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.680]   a great brain. Infinitely bigger brains than yours have been Christians. The trouble isn't
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:38.000]   in your head, it's in your heart. That's the great message of the Bible. He would not.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.520]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews calls it an evil heart of unbelief. Stephen made
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.960]   the same point. He said, "You stiff-necked, that's your trouble. It isn't in your head,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.840]   it's in your neck." And that's another way of saying it's in your heart. Stubborn, stiff-necked,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:03.280]   it's in the will, it's in the sensibilities, it's an attitude. No, no, it's not a purely
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.200]   intellectual matter. It's much deeper. It's much more fundamental. Did you notice how
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.400]   we read about those men that they gnashed with their teeth against Stephen? Do you remember
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.920]   how they treated the Son of God? They cried in fury, "Away with him, crucify him." And
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.560]   though he was there expiring on a cross, they passed in front of him and they mocked him
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:31.680]   and they jeered at him. Look at their bitterness. Is that the calm, rational, intellectualist
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:40.080]   attitude of the scientists? Of course it isn't. They hated him. Evil heart of unbelief, stiff-necked,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:48.640]   he would not. Why wouldn't they? What's the cause of this? Well, again, the Bible is full
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:56.520]   of expositions of this everywhere. My dear friends, whether we like it or not, the fact
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.520]   of the matter is that every one of us, as we are by nature, has a natural antagonism
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:09.680]   towards God. The Apostle Paul has put that plainly, as everybody who attends here on
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:20.280]   a Friday night knows full well in Romans chapter 8, verse 7. The carnal mind is enmity against
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:28.920]   God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Enmity against God. "Oh, but
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.720]   you say I've always believed in God." You've never believed in God. You've believed in
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:43.920]   something that you call God, but that isn't God. The natural mind, the carnal mind, is
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:52.000]   enmity against God. Of course it is. How ready people are to believe that there isn't a God.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.720]   How ready to believe anybody who writes a newspaper article or says something on the
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.320]   television screen or on the broadcast. Oh, they're ready to believe it. Why? Well, there's
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.840]   a natural antagonism to God, feeling he's against us. They're trying to get rid of God.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   They hate him. Not intellectual at all. It's this antagonism, this bitter hatred, this
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.720]   feeling that God's against us, and we want to emancipate ourselves from that. There's
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.840]   nothing new in it, you know. This isn't 20th century. Man's always been like that. The
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.200]   fool has said in his heart centuries ago, "Before Christ, there is no God." Of course,
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:38.240]   that's men in sin. Natural antagonism. He will not. He would not. Well, why then? Well,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.280]   you see, another reason and a cause for the first, in a sense, is this. It's nothing but
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:55.880]   pride. You notice how our Lord repeats this name, Jerusalem. "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem."
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.680]   Why does he repeat it? Well, it's for emphasis, of course. The trouble with them was, you
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:08.400]   see, that they were proud of the fact that they were the people of Jerusalem. You read
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.120]   your Old Testament, you'll always find it. They were proud of it. "We are Jerusalem.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:19.760]   We are God's people." That was their tragedy. They felt, in other words, that all was well
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:28.520]   with them. They were complacent. It was because of that, whenever a prophet came along and
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.840]   even had the temerity to suggest that there was something wrong with them and that they
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.920]   needed to repent, they were furious. You remember John the Baptist? John the Baptist was a stern
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.840]   preacher of repentance. John knew his audience very well. He looked at them and he said,
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.320]   "Now, begin not to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham to our father.'" He knew
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.520]   that that is what they'd say. They'd say, "Why are you preaching like that to us? Don't
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.640]   you know that we are Abraham's children?" "Why," he said, "John, God could make of
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.040]   these sterns, raise up of these sterns children unto Abraham. You don't get out of it like
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.960]   that," says John. But he says, "I know that's what you're saying. We are Abraham's children.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.840]   We are the Jews. We are all right. Of course, these Gentiles, they're dogs. They're irreligious.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.920]   They don't know you. They haven't got your oracles. Oh, they're damned, of course. But
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.360]   we, Jerusalem, we are the children of God, the children of Abraham." Indeed, they did
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.480]   exactly the same with our Lord. He was preaching to them on one occasion and they seemed to
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.360]   be believing his message. He said, "Now, if ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:39.160]   indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." Instead of praising
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:45.240]   God for that, they stood back on their dignity and said, "We be Abraham's seed," and were
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.920]   never in bondage to any man. "How sayest thou, 'Ye shall be made free'?" He said, "You know
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:57.200]   you're insulting us. What are you offering us freedom for? We are Abraham's seed," and
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.480]   were never in bondage to any man. They forgot all about the captivity of Egypt and of Babylon.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:13.120]   Mad, proud, filled with a sense of their own importance, complacent, they reject this message.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:20.320]   That's why they wouldn't listen to the Son of God. They didn't need his salvation. "We're
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.920]   Abraham's seed. We belong to Jerusalem, the chosen people, city of God. We need nothing.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:41.800]   Who are you?" Good people resent this gospel of salvation as much as bad people. Indeed,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:48.160]   I've got authority for saying they do some more. Because our Lord says towards the end
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.560]   of his ministry, "The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you." John
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   came unto you in the way of repentance and he believed him not, but the publicans and
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:09.200]   the harlots believed him and he repented not afterwards when he had seen it. A man says,
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.600]   "Why do you preach like that to me? I've always been brought up in a religious home. I've
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.880]   always been brought up in the realm of the church. I've always lived a good life. I've
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.200]   never done any harm. I've never got drunk. I've never committed adultery. I've never
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:27.400]   done... What are you saying that I need to repent for?" And so Jerusalem feels that she
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:37.360]   is all right, consumed with her own pride and a spirit of self-satisfaction, when he
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:49.800]   comes and offers salvation. She doesn't want it. She rejects it with scorn. He would not.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:55.560]   In other words, the trouble is, you see, as our Lord is here indicating, that these people
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:02.160]   always resent the message of the prophet, "Which killest the prophets and stonest them
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.360]   that are sent unto thee?" Why? Well, because of what they say. And what they say is this.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:15.080]   They come with a message of condemnation of sin. There were other prophets. They were
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.640]   called false prophets. What did they come? Saying, "Ah, they came saying, 'Peace, peace,'
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.600]   when there is no peace. They came healing the affliction of the hurt of the daughter
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.880]   of my people lightly, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace." The false prophet
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.960]   is always a very nice man, always preaches a beautiful gospel, never makes you feel uncomfortable
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:45.120]   at all. He says, "It's all right. Peace, peace, when there is no peace." And he was
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:52.920]   always very popular. But not so the true prophet. The true prophet was stoned, he was killed.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:59.360]   Why? Well, because he came and condemned the life, the sinful life of the nation and the
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:06.600]   people. He called them to repentance. John the Baptist was the last of that mighty succession.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.280]   And what was his message? Well, he preached a baptism of repentance for the remission
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:20.760]   of sins. He says, "Come along, the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Repent. Flee
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   from the wrath to come," said John. He was the last of the prophets, the forerunner of
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.440]   Jesus Christ. And the Lord came Himself and did exactly the same thing. It was a message
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.920]   of condemnation of sin. It was a call to repentance. It was an exhortation to a righteousness and
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:43.240]   holy life and living. You remember the deputations were sent to John one after another. What
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:51.920]   should we do? John gave them the answer, "Exect no more than that which is appointed you."
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.960]   And he said, "If any men have two coats, let him impart to him that hath none, and any
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.760]   men have meat, let him do likewise." And the soldiers came saying, "What shall we do?"
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:09.400]   He said, "Do violence to no men and be content with your wages." Righteousness, holy living,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.520]   truth before God, that's the message. And of course, our Lord preached the same message.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:20.960]   Read his Sermon on the Mount. There it is. He describes the character of the citizen
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:27.320]   of the kingdom. "Blessed are the poor in spirit. Blessed are they that mourn. Blessed
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.520]   are the meek. Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness." There it
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:38.000]   is. And then he takes them point by point through the law. "Love your enemies. Do good
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.200]   to them that hate you. Don't think that you're guiltless because you've never committed an
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:48.040]   act of adultery. If you've done it in your heart, you're guilty." You remember the teaching.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:53.880]   Well, it was because he preached like that. He preached this prophetic message. He denounced
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.360]   the sin of the nation. He exposed it. The Pharisees and scribes felt uncomfortable.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.000]   They felt he was convicting them. "Who is this fellow," they said. "Who is this man
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   who arrogates all this to himself?" And they hated him with a bitter hatred and intensity.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:19.680]   And it ended in their crucifying him and utterly rejecting him. And he would not. Why not?
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:27.440]   Well, because you don't like the truth of God. It disturbs you. It makes you feel miserable.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.320]   It makes you feel unhappy. You say, "I don't want to listen to that sort of stuff." Death
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.800]   and judgment. "Ah, I'm not interested. I want something to comfort me." But here you
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.200]   see the Son of God preached this prophetic message as all the prophets and all who had
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:49.160]   been sent by God had done before him. And they didn't like it. They hated him. The bitterness
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.560]   and the antagonism came out. My dear friends, as you meditate about the cross of Jesus Christ
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.000]   during this coming week, try to explain that. You may say to yourself, "What a terrible
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.400]   thing to do. If I'd been in Jerusalem, I wouldn't have done that." Well, you know, our Lord
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.880]   dealt with that very argument. He exposed it to the very depths. You'll find it in the
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   twenty-third chapter of Matthew's Gospel. Let me just read it to you.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:22.000]   To these words of our Lord. He said, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites."
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.720]   He says, "You're like whited sepulchres." "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.360]   because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous."
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:39.160]   And say, "If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   with them in the blood of the prophets." "Wherefore, be ye witnesses unto yourselves that you are
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.400]   the children of the prophets, the children of them which killed the prophets." "Fill
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.480]   ye up then the measure of your fathers, ye serpents, ye generation of vipers." "How
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:02.560]   can ye escape the damnation of hell?" What's he mean? He means this. He says, "You know,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.400]   you say, if we'd been alive in the days of our fathers, we would never have crucified
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.680]   the prophets." He says, "You would, and I'll prove to you how you would have done so. You're
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:20.320]   now plotting my death, and I'm simply saying what they said. You're doing exactly to me
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.080]   what your fathers did to them. You're praising the prophets. If you'd been alive, then you'd
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.560]   have hated them. Even as you're hating me now, that is the position, and it is still
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.360]   the position. You think of this holy week so-called, and you say, 'What could have overcome
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.440]   those people that they should have crucified this blessed Jesus, this beautiful character?'
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.040]   My friend, if you don't believe in him, you know you would have done exactly the same
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:50.440]   if you'd been there. By not believing in him, you're doing it now." The human heart remains
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:58.600]   the same. Jesus Christ is rejected tonight as he was rejected here in the days of his
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.000]   flesh. Well, that's the first thing. That's the reason why they rejected him, why they
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.320]   refused him. But oh, let us listen as he tries to help us by reminding us of what it is we
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:20.600]   refuse when we do refuse. "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets and
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.440]   stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:38.160]   as a hendeth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not." Oh, this is the tragedy.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:48.280]   They didn't realize this. This is the most tragic part of the whole trouble. Why did
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:58.480]   they reject him? Well, because they didn't realize who he was. "How often would I have
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:07.360]   gathered thy children together." Who is this that speaks like this? Who is this who is
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:15.560]   big enough to take under his wings the city of Jerusalem and all its peoples? Who is this?
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:21.560]   If they'd only realized who he was, they would never have refused him. They never realized
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:29.760]   he was the Son of God. They never realized that he was the Messiah, that he was not a
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:36.480]   prophet only, but the Son, God, sending his only Son into the world. They didn't realize
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:47.120]   that he was God incarnate. And it is still because men and women don't realize who he
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:54.960]   is that they treat him as they do. But listen to what he tells us that he offers. What does
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:02.480]   he offer? Well, he offers protection. And never did even the Son of God use a more beautiful
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:12.520]   illustration. "As a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, oh, how often would I have
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:18.520]   gathered you like that." What is he offering? Well, there it is in the picture. He's offering
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:26.160]   protection. He's offering salvation. Do you see that hen and the little chickens? There
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.800]   they are dancing, prancing round about. Suddenly there comes a cat or a dog or some predatory
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.360]   animal and in their terror and alarm, they run to their mother and she covers them with
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:43.840]   her wings and they're safe. He says he's come into the world to do something like that
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:52.240]   for mankind. To protect, to save. In what senses? Well, there are two main senses here.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.560]   You know, he was telling these people that he had come to protect and to save Jerusalem
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:04.080]   even in a temporal and in a physical sense. You read the twenty-first chapter of this
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.880]   gospel according to St. Luke, or read the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew's gospel,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.680]   or the thirteenth chapter of Mark's gospel, and you will find that in each one of them
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:20.560]   our Lord predicts and prophesies the coming destruction of Jerusalem. It actually didn't
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:29.600]   happen until A.D. 70, some twenty-seven years after he was speaking these words. But there
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:36.320]   and here also he looks forward to the coming destruction of the city of Jerusalem. And
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.600]   he says, "Do you know, if you'd only believed in me and accepted my message and protection,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.240]   your city would not be destroyed." What's he mean? He means this. There was only one
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   reason finally for the destruction of the city of Jerusalem. It wasn't the Roman armies.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.560]   They actually did the job, but that's not the reason. Why was Jerusalem sacked and destroyed
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:09.400]   in A.D. 70? I can tell you. It was God punishing the city. As God had allowed them to suffer
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:16.360]   in Egypt and as God had sent them to the captivity of Babylon, it was God who raised up the Chaldean
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.560]   army which sacked the city of Jerusalem then. The same God was going to do it again. Why?
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:29.520]   Well, because his people had apostatized. Because they had turned their backs upon him.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:35.840]   Because they had groveled in sin and had rejected him and his rule over them. And here our Lord
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.320]   is telling them that. Look here, he says, "You don't know Jerusalem. You're proud
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.160]   of yourself, the great city of God standing there on the top of that great crag. You say
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.720]   you're impregnable and you point to your buildings. It's all going to be razed to the ground."
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:56.840]   It need never have happened. If only you'd accepted me as the son of God and your Messiah
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:04.720]   and your Savior, I would have saved you from the destruction of your city and of your temple.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.600]   But he would not. Yes, it's true in a temporal sense, but of course the main thing is the
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:17.000]   spiritual sense. And his message to us tonight is this spiritual message. Here is the Son
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.440]   of God standing and speaking to you this evening and saying, "Friend, you can be rescued.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:30.760]   You can be saved. You can be protected to all eternity. Come unto me." What is he talking
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:41.880]   about? Well, it is just his pictorial way of reminding us of the coming judgment of
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:54.720]   God. We are all of us under God. God is there in his heavens and we are upon earth. And
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:01.280]   every one of us is responsible to God and accountable to God. And as certainly as we
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.320]   are in this chapel at this minute, every one of us will have to stand in the presence of
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:13.680]   that holy God at the dread day of judgment. And what will he demand of us? Well, he's
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:23.760]   made it so plain. I beseech you, read your Ten Commandments. Read your moral law. Read
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.440]   the message of this great succession of prophets to whom Christ refers. Read the Sermon on
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.640]   the Mount. Read the Epistles. Read the book of Acts and its speeches. And you'll find
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.320]   there is one great recurring message, that man is under God and we'll have to meet him
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.360]   and stand before him and give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:57.680]   bad, and you and I will be there. And what he came into the world to do was to offer
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:12.120]   us safety and protection when the blasts of the law are booming, reminding us that there
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:17.480]   is only one God and no other, that we must worship him and love him with all our hearts
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:25.640]   and mind and soul and strength, and our neighbor as ourself. When the stern demands of the
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:35.080]   law will be coming and we will be asked, "What's your answer?" Don't you see the need of protection
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:46.440]   and of safety? "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:55.560]   together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings. Do you know, my dear friends, the
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:03.080]   Son of God came into the world to save?" He said, "The Son of Man is come to seek and
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:12.440]   to save that which is lost. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:19.200]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish. He will otherwise, but he sent his
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:25.800]   Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." That's
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:31.200]   what he's come to do, to spread his wings, to shield us and to protect us so that we
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.280]   can't be seen. He says, "That's what I've come to do." That's what he's saying here.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:41.040]   How does he do this? What does he mean by his analogy? Well, here's the message of Good
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:55.880]   Friday. As the wings of that hen stand between those little chicks and everything that is
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:04.040]   threatening to kill them and to destroy them, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, stands between
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:12.680]   all who believe in him and the law and the wrath and the punishment of God upon men's
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:20.080]   sins and unrighteousness. What was he doing on the cross on Calvary's hill? Do you know
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:30.440]   the answer? Spreading his wings, giving us a place to go and hide, so that when the law
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:39.320]   shouts, he answers. He did answer. He stood between us and everything that threatens us.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:45.200]   And what threatens us is the law and the justice and the righteousness and the holiness of
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:50.880]   God. We've sinned and we deserve punishment and hell. He stands between us. He covers
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:39:02.000]   us. He's covered our sins by taking them upon himself and dying for them. That's what was
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.960]   happening on Calvary's cross. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was receiving your punishment
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:16.680]   and mine. That's what was happening. He stood there and he received it all. And not only
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:26.640]   that, he offers to cover you with the cloak and the robe of his own spotless righteousness.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:32.800]   He lived a perfect and a holy life. He never broke a single one of God's laws. He has satisfied
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.160]   God in the demands of God's holy law. And you know, he offers to cover you with that,
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.640]   so that when the law comes and says, "What have you done about this?" you point to him
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:53.720]   and you say, "He's done it." And God looks upon all who believe in Christ. And he sees
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:04.400]   not us and our miserable failure and sin and shame. He sees the righteousness of Jesus
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:15.200]   Christ. You see, Count Zinzendorf had seen this very clearly when he sang, "Jesus, thy
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:24.680]   blood and righteousness, my beauty is my glorious dress. 'Midst flaming worlds, in
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:36.120]   this arrayed, with joy shall I lift up my head.'" Oh, my friend, do you realize what
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:44.280]   the Son of God offers you? You see, men rejected him because they didn't realize who he was
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:51.240]   and they didn't realize what he was offering and what they were refusing. Do you realize
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:57.240]   it? That if you don't believe in him, you are refusing to be covered from law, from
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:04.960]   wrath, from death, from the grave, from everything that will destroy you. To be covered by Jesus'
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:14.520]   blood and righteousness and to be reconciled to God, that is what he offered.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:25.400]   And that brings me to his last word, which is this. You see the sequence? Why men refuse,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:37.240]   what they refuse, the consequences of refusing. "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem which killest the
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:52.040]   children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not behold
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:42:02.400]   your house is left unto you desolate. And verily I say unto you, ye shall not see me
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:09.760]   until the time come when ye shall say, 'Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.'"
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:20.160]   Oh, it was because Jerusalem had never realized the consequences of the rejection that she
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:28.600]   was guilty of the rejection. What are the consequences? I merely mention them. "Behold,
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:37.840]   your house is left unto you desolate." What does he mean? Well, primarily this is a reference
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:43.480]   to the temple, the house that they boasted of so much and which they believed was going
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   to save them, the house, the temple. And what he is telling them is this, he says, "You
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:56.280]   know that house in Jerusalem, that temple is nothing without me. There is no value in
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:02.480]   the house itself. God dwelleth not in temples made with hens, as Stephen said to his accusers.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.800]   Don't rely upon the temple, upon the house. It is God's house. If God goes, it is nothing
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:15.400]   but a derelict building. Your house is left to you desolate, derelict, useless." And
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.120]   what he is telling them here is this, he says, "If you persist in rejecting me, I will
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.040]   tell you what is going to happen to you. I shall leave you to yourselves. I will leave
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.000]   your house to yourselves and it will become an empty shell. And not only that, it is going
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.320]   to be destroyed, it is going to be razed to the ground. Your house is left to you desolate.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:40.120]   You are rejecting me and relying upon the temple of God. You say, 'The temple of the
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:46.240]   Lord, the temple of the Lord.' It can't help you. When I go out, it is a slum, it
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.080]   is derelict, it is desolate, and it will be destroyed, flattened. You will have nothing.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:44:02.280]   I leave you desolate." What a terrible thing. Here were people who rejected the Son of God
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:08.080]   and his offer because they were relying upon their religion, upon their offerings and sacrifices,
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.120]   upon their religiosity, upon all their goodness and morality, and all they were doing in the
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:23.320]   temple. He says, "It will be useless, desolate." And you know, my friend, this is the terrible
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:33.040]   thing for us to realize this evening. Anybody who rejects Jesus Christ and his offer always
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:43.520]   does so for some reason. I wonder what your reason is. Are you rejecting him because of
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.280]   some pleasure that you are holding on to, something in the world that you like very
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.720]   much and you say you are not going to give it up? All right, it may be that. What else?
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:57.720]   Well, there are others who hold on to their morality. They say, "I don't want your
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.600]   Christ and your atonement and your death. I am all right as I am. Look at my life."
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.000]   Others are relying upon their religion. They say, "We have always been brought up to
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.960]   it and I am a church member and I don't see that I need to be born again and believe
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:15.240]   that Christ died for me." Religion, as these Jews did.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:25.200]   Well, all I have got to tell you is what the Son of God says to such people. He says, "All
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:31.880]   right, if you are turning your backs upon me and refusing me and my gracious offer because
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:42.680]   of those things, I will leave you to yourselves and those things. All right, go on. Your house
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:50.840]   is left to you. Go on with your pleasure. Go on with your religion. Go on with your
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:57.560]   morality. Go on with your good works. Go on with whatever it is that makes you reject
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:08.120]   the Son of God. Go on with it. Carry on." And when illness suddenly overtakes you, "All
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:14.280]   right, go on. Carry on with your pleasure. Go on. Have a good time." When you get the
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.480]   verdict that you have got a bronchial carcinoma or a growth somewhere else that is going to
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:25.800]   kill you, "Go on. Get on with your pleasure. Rely upon your morality. Go on with your religiosity.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:35.160]   I leave it to you. Your house is left to you." But will it be of any help to you? Will it
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:42.920]   be of any value to you? Will you be able to be resting upon it? What is the value of your
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:50.600]   jazz and your drink and your sex when you have lost your health? Or when someone dearer
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   than life to you is dying at your side? Or when you are lying on your own deathbed? Or
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.200]   when you will stand in the day of judgment? What will be the value of your house to you?
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.800]   Whatever your house is, get on with it. And you will find that it is a shambles, it is
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.600]   a desolation, it is a derelict building. It will collapse round about your ears. You will
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:21.880]   have nothing. It matters not at all what we put in the place of the Son of God. I cannot
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.160]   imagine anything more terrible than this, than to be left with it, dying with beer or
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:31.400]   drink and all this that they boast so much about and praise so much on your wireless
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.360]   and television, as if it was the most marvelous thing in the world, dying with that or with
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:51.240]   sex. Your house is left to you, desolate, collapsing, disappearing, nothing left.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:48:00.040]   Oh, my dear friend, I beseech you, realize the consequence of rejecting this offer of
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:05.800]   the Son of God. It just means that you will go out of this life into eternity exactly
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:11.640]   as you are now. Have you got anything you can rely on when you come to die? Have you
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.600]   got anything to say when you stand before God? What are you going to rely on? If you
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:21.880]   are relying on these things, you will have nothing, desolate.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:29.400]   And still more terribly says, "Ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say,
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:36.120]   'Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,' but it will be too late then.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:43.360]   Every eye shall see him, yea, and they that pierced him, but it will be too late. Your
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:49.280]   fate and mine is decided in this world, but this Christ whom we reject, he remains. He
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.320]   is in glory, he will come back, and every eye shall see him, yea, and they which pierced
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:03.960]   him, they will see then that he is the Lord of glory, but it will be damnation to them."
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:14.680]   So you see, our blessed Lord and Savior looks upon us this night and warns us and pleads
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:28.800]   with us, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft, how oft would I have gathered thy children
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:42.040]   together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings? Realize who he is, realize why
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   he came into the world, realize what he offers you, the shadow of his wings, safety in life,
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:50:06.080]   safety in death, throughout eternity. Realize the consequences of refusing such a gracious
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:18.720]   offer offered at the cost of his life, his very blood, and realizing it, take immediately
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:29.800]   a stand with Charles Wesley and say, 'Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to thy bosom fly.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:35.920]   I want to be covered while the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high. I'm
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:42.320]   getting older, health is going, I've got to die, dear ones are going, calamities, while
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:51.000]   the nearer waters roll, while the tempest still is high. Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:03.400]   till the storm of life is past. Safe into the haven guide, O receive my soul at last.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:09.920]   Or if you prefer it, say it with Augustus, 'Top lady, rock of ages, cleft for me, let
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:22.320]   me hide myself in thee. Hide!' Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flowed
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:29.240]   be of sin, the double cure cleanse me from its guilt and pure while I draw this fleeting
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:37.080]   breath when mine eyes shall close in death. When I soar through tracks unknown, leave
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:44.680]   my friends and loved ones and die and am going in that unknown direction. When I soar through
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:58.160]   tracks unknown, see thee on thy judgment throne, rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:06.440]   in thee. Oh, fly to him, get under the shadow of his wings, fly, he offers protection still,
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:13.640]   it is not too late. See the hardness of your heart that has made you refuse him until this
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:24.080]   night. See what you are refusing, see the terrible, awful, tragic consequences of doing
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:34.160]   so. And fly to him, be covered, be made safe. Amen.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:40.760]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
