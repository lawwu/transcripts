[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   I should like to direct your attention once more to the great prayer of the Apostle Paul
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.200]   for the Ephesians, as it is to be found recorded in the third chapter of the Epistle to the
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.160]   Ephesians, reading from verse 14 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.880]   For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.760]   family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.840]   of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.380]   may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.040]   able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.320]   and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.060]   the fullness of God.
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.840]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.840]   according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.320]   Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.320]   Amen.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.440]   But at the moment we are still considering that great phrase at the end of the nineteenth
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:39.400]   verse, "that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God."
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.080]   I was reminding you when we began to consider this statement last Sunday morning that there
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:55.640]   is nothing more sublime, more exalted and elevated in the whole realm and range of Scripture
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   than this.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.040]   This is the highest conceivable petition that a human soul can ever offer.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.020]   There is nothing in the realm of contemplation or of meditation which is higher than this.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.820]   This is the end of all theology, the acme of spiritual experience.
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.000]   We certainly are standing at this moment, as we look at this phrase, upon the very highest
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.200]   mountain peak on which men and women can ever stand in this life and world.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.240]   Indeed, there is a sense in which it is true to say that we are looking at and meditating
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.320]   upon this morning what will be the theme of our meditation and contemplation throughout
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.280]   the countless ages of eternity.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.740]   We have seen, therefore, the necessity of being careful in our definition and understanding
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:07.160]   of this phrase, lest we misinterpret it in terms of a false mysticism which would teach
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.880]   the possibility of our being absorbed in the divine or the eternal, or an equally bad and
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.160]   nefarious pantheism which would suggest that God becomes lost, as it were, in us.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.800]   Both those, of course, are to be avoided.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.720]   And therefore, we considered this great statement more or less theologically and doctrinally
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.520]   last time, and saw that in its essence it means this.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.480]   This is the result of Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.440]   It pleased God that in him should all fullness dwell.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.120]   In him, indeed, dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and we are complete
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.880]   in him.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.000]   And then I ended by indicating that the Scripture does help us to look into this great mystery,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.840]   not to give us a final understanding, of course, but it does, with its analogies, help us to
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.360]   see something of how this actually works in us.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.640]   I referred you to our Lord's own picture of himself as the vine, and ourselves as the
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.420]   branches in the vine, and then the oft-used illustration of the body, the illustration
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.120]   used by the Apostle in this epistle.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.680]   We saw it again in that twelfth chapter of the epistle to the Romans; it's there in
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.080]   1 Corinthians 12.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.680]   He constantly uses it.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.360]   It obviously is the nearest that we can ever get in meditation and understanding to a realization
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.440]   of this extraordinary possibility that we may be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.520]   In us as members of the body dwells the fullness of the head.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.400]   The fullness of the head passes through to every single individual member of the body,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.760]   however poor, however uncomely it may be, and however much it may be considered less
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.320]   worthy by us in comparison with other members.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.080]   In other words, we indicated that this doesn't mean we all become equal and identical in
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.980]   every respect.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.920]   But as to use the word of the Apostle in that twelfth of Romans again, God gives this according
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.720]   to the measure of faith.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.000]   There is a division.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.720]   We can all be filled with the fullness of God, and yet we are not all identical; we
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.240]   are all different.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.480]   According to our measure, we are full, and can be full to overflowing.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.680]   Now then, there is the point at which we have left this great subject, but it is essential
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   that we should be carrying all that in our minds as now we proceed to look at it once
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.800]   more.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.040]   And as we do so, I would again insist upon our realization that we are dealing with something
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.480]   which is essentially practical.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.720]   Now there are people who seem to think always when they come across a phrase like this,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.600]   that here you've turned your back upon the practical aspect of the Christian life, and
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:31.520]   now you're just going to enjoy yourself in some kind of vague, abstract, mystic contemplation.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   That is a complete error.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   The man who wrote these words was an evangelist, and a teacher, and a pastor.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.800]   And as he wrote this portion, he wasn't simply concerned to give these Ephesians some mystical
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.120]   delight or some interesting metaphysical problem to unravel and to try to understand.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.600]   He didn't write this in order that they might argue about it.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.320]   He wrote this in order that they might know that he was praying, and praying constantly
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.920]   for them, that they might experience this, that they might know this in their daily life
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.980]   and living and combat as Christian men and women.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:23.280]   It is, I say, something which is essentially practical and active.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.820]   It is a concrete reality, a very real possibility.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:39.920]   Indeed, I venture to assert that there is nothing which is quite as practical as this.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.100]   Now let me demonstrate that proposition.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.820]   I am asserting that this which we are considering together here, this prayer of the Apostle
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:54.140]   for these Ephesians, is the most urgently practical matter for the Christian Church
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.620]   at this very moment.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:03.020]   But, alas, I'm afraid it's true to add that the Church doesn't realize that.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.360]   Because you see, we've got this fatal notion that to be practical means that we indulge
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.020]   in activities on our own level.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.580]   That isn't the New Testament view ever.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.700]   If you really want to do things for God and for Christ, says the New Testament, you don't
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.260]   begin to get busy.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.140]   You first of all make certain that you are filled with the fullness of God and the power
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.660]   that follows that of necessity.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.400]   You see, this man who writes here, who conceivably did more in the Christian Church than any
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.700]   other man has ever done, let us never forget that this man spent three years in Arabia
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.220]   before he set out in his ministry.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.060]   He didn't begin to act the moment he was converted.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.460]   He didn't subscribe, I think, to the modern slogan which is, "Give the converts something
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.460]   to do.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.340]   Rush them into an activity."
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.620]   Three years in Arabia.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.100]   But when he came out of that Arabia, he came out filled with this fullness of God and with
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.780]   power.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:13.860]   And that is the explanation of his mighty activity and the amazing results that attended
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.860]   his ministry.
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.540]   And this, of course, we know has been so many times proved in the history of other servants
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.260]   of God throughout the centuries.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:28.020]   There was never a busier man or a more active man than John Wesley before 1738, but he didn't
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.100]   lead to much.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:35.500]   But then you see as a result of that one experience in Aldersgate Street, his whole ministry was
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.260]   changed and he became powerful and mighty.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.260]   Why?
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:46.060]   Well, he had followed the New Testament pattern, realizing that he lacked this power and this
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.800]   ability, this fullness.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.020]   He almost felt that he must stop preaching, you remember.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:10:00.540]   But it was only when he came to this position that then God used him and the Spirit was
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.780]   able to imply him in that striking manner.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.220]   So that I say that there is nothing more practical than this.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.940]   The man who really is practical is not the man who is just bustling and busy and excited
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.200]   and rushing about here and there.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:22.660]   The man who really is practical is the man who is being employed by God and used by the
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.060]   Holy Spirit.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.020]   All that the Church might come back to realize this.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:36.140]   Its revival the Church needs, and it is only when she is revived that she becomes powerful.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:42.380]   And while we are trusting yet to our own abilities and activities, we shall avail nothing.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:50.620]   The Church needs this fullness, and this is the thing that leads to the practical activity.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:56.300]   But is it not true to say that the Church, I say, is lacking in this respect?
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:02.060]   I came across a phrase only this last week which seemed to me to say the truth about
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.140]   so many of us who are Christians at this present time.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:17.380]   The man writing said, "Religion seems to be part of the unexamined and largely unused
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.060]   background of life."
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:25.220]   He says, "Religion with so many people inside the Church is nothing but a kind of
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.860]   unexamined and unused background.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.860]   It's there in the background of their lives, but it isn't in the foreground, it isn't
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.860]   in the center."
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.340]   He then goes on to use what I think is a very wonderful illustration.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.980]   He says, "To the vast majority it can be compared with the knowledge that in an emergency
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:52.180]   999 can be dialed."
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.620]   Well let every man examine himself.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.380]   Where do these things come in your life?
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.340]   Is it something that you like to have, you know it's there, if you're taken desperately
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:12.020]   ill, or a loved one is, or if you're suddenly confronted by a loss of your income, or if
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.700]   some disaster happens, or if you're on your deathbed, then you can turn to it, "Ah,
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.940]   it's nice to have it in the background."
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.840]   But that isn't where it's meant to be.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.780]   That isn't the kind of thing the Apostle is praying for for these Ephesians in his
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.780]   prayer.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.860]   It isn't some reserve you can fall back on.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.140]   It isn't some emergency station you can ring up and be assured of help when you do
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.140]   so.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.260]   It's unexamined, and it's largely unused.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.500]   Now, I'm sure that we all must have felt, as we've been working our way through this
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.700]   great prayer, we must have felt condemned.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.780]   Do we know what it is to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man?
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.880]   Is Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith?
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.180]   Do we know with all saints the depth, the breadth, and the length, and the depth, and
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:13.100]   the height, and to know this love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that we might be
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.540]   filled with all the fullness of God?
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.980]   Are we?
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.020]   Are we concerned?
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.180]   Is this central to us?
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.180]   Is this vital?
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.540]   Where does Christianity come in our lives?
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.180]   Yes, those of us who are Christian.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:34.740]   Is it something that we only remember on Sunday morning, I wonder, and forget even the rest
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.740]   of Sunday?
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.260]   Or on weekdays?
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.580]   Is it something that we are only reminded of now and again?
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:47.740]   Or is it the very center and be-all and end-all of our life, and existence, and activity?
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:54.180]   Paul is praying that it may become such that we may know all the fullness of God.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.180]   Well, very well.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.820]   What does that mean in practice?
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.740]   What does it mean experimentally?
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.620]   We've looked at it doctrinally; now let's look at it experimentally, and from the practical
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.940]   standpoint.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:14.780]   What is true of a man who knows what it is to be filled with all the fullness of God?
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:26.060]   Well, first of all, it must mean this, that God dwells in us in such a way as absolutely
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:31.620]   to control us and all our faculties.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.580]   If we are filled with all the fullness of God, well, it follows, I think, of necessity
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:43.760]   by a logical inevitability that God controls the whole of our life.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:52.700]   He controls, if you like, our cognitions, our feelings, and our outward actions.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:15:00.380]   Man must be thought of ever in terms of his mind, and his heart, and his will.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.580]   And if we are filled with all the fullness of God, it means that God is controlling us
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:14.380]   in the mind, the realm of cognition, in the heart, the feelings, the sensibilities, and
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.220]   in the realm of the will, the outward actions, and all our activities.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.460]   Well, now let's examine this.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.460]   What does that lead to?
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.060]   What would it mean?
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:35.080]   Well, it means, I say first and foremost, that our thinking is dominated by God, and
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.820]   by the mind of God.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:44.660]   Now, there are statements here in the Scriptures which indicate very clearly what all that
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.660]   means.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.460]   Take, for instance, that statement that I was reading to you just now in the twelfth
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:55.500]   chapter of the epistle to the Romans, where the Apostle puts it like this.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.140]   He says, "You see, brethren, by the mercies of God I beseech you that you present your
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:08.740]   bodies, your literal, physical bodies, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.900]   is your reasonable service."
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.140]   Don't worry about the translation there.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.620]   It means, really, spiritual sacrifice, if you like.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:23.540]   But here's the thing I wanted to emphasize, "And be not conformed to this world, but
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:30.100]   be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.460]   That's it.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:38.220]   "That ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God, the renewing
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.140]   of the mind."
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.380]   You see, the mind is never free.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.940]   There's no such thing as free thought.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.700]   It's always an utter impossibility.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.380]   Man's mind is never free.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:03.700]   Oh, I know the Rationalist Press Association claims that it is, but that's just the tragic
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.380]   fallacy that ever results from sin.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:14.020]   The mind is, by nature and as the result of sin, always controlled by the world.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.020]   The outlook of the world.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.660]   Very well, the difference between a man who's not a Christian and a Christian is that whereas
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.420]   the non-Christian's mind is controlled by the world, this man's mind has been transformed
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.300]   and has been renewed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:38.740]   And the result is that this man is now able to think in a spiritual manner, whereas formerly
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.740]   he couldn't.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:45.260]   Now, there's a great exposition of this, as you recall, in the second chapter of Paul's
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:53.700]   first epistle to the Corinthians, where he says that the natural mind, the natural man,
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.020]   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.900]   He says that they are foolishness unto him.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:07.500]   He says that what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him?
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:14.620]   And so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.740]   He says this natural man doesn't receive them, their foolishness, unto him, neither can he
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.740]   know them.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.740]   Why?
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   Well, because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.420]   But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.860]   For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:42.460]   And then the most amazing statement, "But we have the mind of Christ."
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.420]   You see what he means?
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:50.780]   If we are filled with all the fullness of God, if Christ dwells in our hearts by faith,
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:56.960]   we have the mind of Christ.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.020]   It's inevitable, and the apostle claims it.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:06.220]   In other words, he says that the man who is filled with all the fullness of God is a man
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.980]   who can think spiritually.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.780]   And this is a very wonderful thing.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:19.500]   There is to me nothing more glorious, nothing in a sense more romantic, about the Christian
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:27.780]   life than the way it entirely changes a man's type of thinking, his whole mode and method
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.820]   of thinking.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:35.780]   Are we all clear about the difference between thinking naturally and thinking spiritually?
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:42.300]   This new outlook, yes, but not only the new outlook, but it's a way and a type of thinking.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.220]   For instance, do you find these epistles of Paul difficult?
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.460]   Or are you able to follow them?
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.700]   Do you feel you understand what he's talking about?
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.100]   That's a very good way of testing ourselves.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.460]   These are spiritual thinking.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.940]   This man thought spiritually.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:04.140]   He says we speak these things not in human language, not in the words of man's thinking,
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.040]   but according to the Spirit.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.840]   We express them spiritually.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.000]   The terminology is spiritual.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.420]   Everything is spiritual.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.860]   And of course, unless we have the renewed, the transformed mind, unless we have the mind
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.580]   of Christ, these things are foolishness, but not to the man in whom Christ dwells, not
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.500]   in the man who has this fullness of God within him.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:34.420]   His mind is now being governed and controlled by God.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.180]   In other words, I can put it like this, you know that great hymn of Francis Ridley Havergill,
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:45.340]   "Take my life and let it be," well, one verse, he puts it like this, "Take my intellect and
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:52.420]   use every power as thou shalt choose."
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:21:00.740]   It's very difficult to put these things into words, but it is this essential difference
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   in the type and the kind of thinking.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.080]   It's unlike political thinking.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.220]   It's unlike philosophical teaching.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:15.060]   It's spiritual thinking, and that's why, you see, a man who hasn't much intellect can think
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.800]   spiritually sometimes very much better than a man of a very great brain.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.380]   It's an entirely different type and mold of thinking.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:30.740]   There is an instinctive, intuitional element in it, but above everything else, it is spiritual.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.220]   Very well, that's the first thing, I must hurry on.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:40.860]   The second thing that it controls, of course, is our feeling, our emotional part of our
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:47.220]   being, and this, of course, is again equally inevitable.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:53.940]   The man in whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead, or the fullness of God, not the
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.220]   fullness of the Godhead.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.020]   The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.180]   We are not told that the fullness of the Godhead is to dwell in us, but all the fullness of
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.620]   God.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:10.180]   Such a man, I say, is controlled by the love of God in exactly the same way.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:16.060]   Now, you can't read the Gospels without noticing how frequently our blessed Lord and Savior
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.260]   makes that point.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.620]   He says that he hasn't come to do things in and of himself, he has come to please the
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.340]   Father.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.100]   He has come to glorify the Father.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.660]   And the thing he could say at the end was, "Father, I have glorified thy name."
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:42.780]   In other words, when God controls our hearts, self has gone out.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.340]   And that is really all that need be said.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.820]   When the love of God comes in, the love of self goes out.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:56.500]   And of course, when the love of self goes out and the love of God comes in, we begin
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.740]   to love others.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.620]   It was all there in the twelfth chapter of Romans.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:09.020]   But look at this great example of it, that notable example in the case of Stephen, the
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:14.660]   martyr Stephen, there he is condemned unjustly, being stoned to death.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:22.980]   But what he said was this, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge."
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:29.540]   You see, he was so delivered from self that like his blessed Lord and Master before him,
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.980]   he could pray for his enemies.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.300]   He could love his enemies and pray God to have mercy upon them.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.580]   "Lay not this sin to their charge."
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.740]   And it is the same exactly with this Apostle Paul.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:49.260]   Do you remember that great statement of his in writing to the Corinthians, first epistle,
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.260]   fourth chapter?
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:58.620]   He says, "With me it is a very small thing that I be judged of you or of any man's judgment.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.580]   Yea, I judge not mine own self."
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.620]   What a transformation.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.980]   There was a time when this man was very sensitive to judgment.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.540]   He judged others and he hated being judged himself, being criticized.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.180]   But he says, "Don't worry, it's gone.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.900]   It's a very small thing with me that I be judged of you or of any man's judgment.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.420]   I judge not mine own self."
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:32.020]   That means that this man was filled with the love of God and the love of self and concern
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.400]   about self had gone out.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.060]   He was controlled by God.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.480]   It didn't concern him, now, what people said and thought about him.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:46.320]   It's what they thought about God that mattered, what they thought about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.580]   That aspect of life is controlled by God.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.820]   And in exactly the same way, the will is controlled by God.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.500]   And all the actions and activities, again, you see our Lord puts it, "I came not to do
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:05.140]   mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.620]   That's it.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.580]   Even the Son of God didn't hold on to his prerogatives.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:18.060]   He humbled himself, he became a servant and he set aside his own will and all he said
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.780]   and all he did was the will of the Father.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.700]   "I came not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.660]   Ah, but it wasn't only true of the Lord himself.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.100]   You know, this is equally true of the Apostle Paul.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.260]   Listen to him saying farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:45.660]   He says, "I'm rushing up to Jerusalem," and he says, "I know not the things that shall
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:51.180]   befall me there, save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city saying that bonds
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.700]   and afflictions abide me."
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:01.220]   But none of these things moved me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.420]   I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:12.460]   Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.860]   His will was entirely lost in the will of his Lord.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:22.500]   "Take my will and make it thine, it shall be no longer mine," had been his prayer and
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.300]   it had been answered, it had come to pass.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:31.200]   And he says the same thing again, you'll find it in Acts 21, almost an exact repetition
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.680]   of what he said at Ephesus.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.540]   They were trying to plead with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.260]   They said, "We know that you're going to be dealt with very severely."
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:45.060]   Then Paul answered, "What, me need to weep and to break mine heart?
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.580]   For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.100]   Jesus."
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.740]   He had no will of his own.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.340]   It had gone, it had become absorbed in that respect.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.220]   He had surrendered it, it was lost.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:08.940]   He was entirely governed by the mind and the heart and the will of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.340]   who dwelt in his heart by faith.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.420]   Now that, I say, is the first inevitable result.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:23.220]   Oh, let me put it to you, in some great words by Charles Wesley, I think one of his greatest
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.500]   hymns of all.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:33.540]   It's in the book, hymn number 655, "Give me the faith which can remove and sink the mountain
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.780]   to a plain.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.980]   Give me the childlike praying love which longs to build thy house again.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:48.900]   Thy love, let it my heart or power, let it my ransomed soul devour.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:55.740]   I would the precious time redeem and longer live for this alone, to spend and to be spent
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:00.380]   for them who have not yet my Saviour known.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:07.620]   Fully on these my mission prove and only breathe to breathe thy love.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:15.020]   Thy talents, gifts, and graces, Lord, into thy blessed hands receive and let me live
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.260]   to preach thy word.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:26.740]   And let me to thy glory live my every sacred moment spend in publishing the sinner's friend.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:35.140]   Enlarge, inflame, and fill my heart with boundless charity divine.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:44.380]   So shall I all my strength exert and love them with a zeal like thine, and lead them
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:54.100]   to thine open side, the sheep for whom their shepherd died."
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.660]   That's it.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.260]   That's what he longed for, that's what he prayed for, this prayer that Paul was praying
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:06.580]   for these Ephesians, and that is what, by the grace of God, he was given to experience.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.020]   Very well, there's the first thing.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:16.740]   All the men, the mind, the heart, the will, are subdued by and controlled by God and the
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.660]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:28.860]   But secondly, a man who is filled with all the fullness of God is a man whose every spiritual
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:35.300]   aim and instinct are satisfied.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.500]   All his spiritual aims and instincts are satisfied.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.500]   Why?
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.180]   Well, he is filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.940]   You see, the moment we are born again, the moment we are regenerated, the moment this
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:55.740]   new principle of life is put into us, the moment we become partakers of the divine nature,
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:02.740]   there are new instincts, new desires, new aims, new objectives, and these begin to stir.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.500]   And we are anxious to have their fulfillment, and when we are filled with all the fullness
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.060]   of God, they are fulfilled and they are satisfied.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.060]   What are they?
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:16.580]   Well, here is one, isn't it?
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:22.140]   The moment you have this life within you, you begin to have a desire that you'd never
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.980]   known before, to know God.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:33.460]   I didn't say to know about God, I said to know him, to know God.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.980]   You see, "The psalmist knew it as the heart panteth after the waterbrook, so panteth my
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.340]   heart after thee, O God.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.980]   My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:52.520]   When shall I come and appear before God?"
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.440]   Do you know that desire?
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:03.620]   Has that desire been satisfied, that I might know him?
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.820]   This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.740]   whom thou hast sent, not to know about him abstractly, theoretically, so that you can
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.740]   talk and argue.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.740]   No, no.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:24.240]   A knowledge, an intimacy, a directness, a knowledge of God, that's the thing.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.660]   And that is in every child of God.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:33.500]   Oh, he is interested still in other forms of knowledge, but they are all secondary to
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.940]   this, to know him.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:50.500]   And likewise, there is a love instinct, crying, clamouring for satisfaction.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.740]   And here I'm referring not only to knowing the love of God and of Christ, we've already
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:04.380]   dealt with that, but you see a child of God longs to be filled with love himself.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.060]   He's unhappy because of an absence of love.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:15.340]   "Lord, it is my chief complaint that my love is weak and faint."
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.420]   He's unhappy about that.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:20.900]   He wants to love God more, he wants to love Christ more, he wants to be filled with love
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.540]   to his fellow men and women.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.540]   And he reads 1 Corinthians 13 and he says, "That's how I should be.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.020]   I want to be like that.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.340]   I want to be filled with this love.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.460]   I want to be an exemplifier of it."
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.860]   And you see, when a man is filled with all the fullness of God, he becomes like that,
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:47.700]   because the fruit of the Spirit is, first and foremost, love.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:55.900]   And he becomes a man that looks like the man depicted in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:01.220]   So, we ought to spend more time in that chapter.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.660]   It ought to be the subject of our daily meditation.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:14.500]   "Charity suffereth long and is kind; charity or love envieth not, vaunteth not itself,
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:21.900]   is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:28.860]   seeketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things,
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:40.060]   believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things, love never faileth."
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.580]   And if we are truly children of God, we long for that.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.740]   We long to be like that.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.660]   And I say, when we are filled with all the fullness of God, the longing has been satisfied.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.220]   And we know something about this.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:59.540]   We are like that, to our own amazement.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.940]   And then the longing for righteousness.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.380]   Oh, our Lord has said this himself, hasn't he?
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:12.540]   "In the most perfect manner blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:18.580]   for they shall be filled, filled with righteousness."
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:26.060]   Child of God, you of necessity must be hungering and thirsting and longing after righteousness.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.140]   Aren't you tired of sinning?
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.780]   Aren't you tired of failing?
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.500]   Aren't you tired of going wrong?
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.620]   There is an instinct in you now for holiness and for righteousness.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.700]   You no longer are complaining that the Christian life is narrow.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.500]   If you are, you are not a child, you are confessing it.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.420]   If you have to drag yourself to worship God, you are not a child, I am afraid.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.540]   Examine yourself.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:54.900]   The instinct of the child is the longing, the desire for righteousness and holiness.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:35:00.900]   And we have that blessed promise that it shall be filled.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.500]   And then one other I would mention in passing, and that is the longing to have power to serve
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.260]   him and to glorify his name.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.740]   I have already read Charles Wesley's Hymn to You.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.860]   He expresses it perfectly, it was his one burning passion.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:20.380]   Listen to Paul putting it, Paul had received it, in Colossians 1, 28 and 29, referring
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:25.260]   to the Lord Jesus Christ, he says, "Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:31.020]   every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, whereunto
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:41.060]   I also labour, striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily."
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.660]   He knew it.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:49.460]   He knew what it was to be thrilling with the power of God through the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.660]   He says, "I am working, I am doing this, I am doing it in all diligence, yes, but I
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:59.500]   am doing it according to, by means of, as a result of this mighty working that is working
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.860]   in me so mightily."
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.620]   Do we know anything about this, my friends?
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:13.780]   I take leave to say this to you in all humility, there is nothing more blessed under heaven
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.820]   than to know the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:22.980]   I am sorry for anybody who has never known it as he has been preaching and trying to
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.860]   expound this word.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.220]   There is all the difference in the world, it is almost the difference between heaven
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:33.340]   and hell for a man to be preaching in his own might and strength, and the power of the
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.300]   Spirit working mightily within him.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:46.780]   But it can happen to the individual in conversation and in all his activities and in all his endeavors.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:54.140]   Oh, when we are filled with all the fullness of God, all our spiritual instincts and aims
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:37:00.980]   are satisfied, and they are satisfied to the full, I must not keep you, but again go back,
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:09.900]   I beseech you, and read and learn and commit to memory that great hymn of John Casper Laverter,
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:16.500]   which we sang immediately before this sermon, "O Jesus Christ, grow thou in me, and all
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.740]   things else receive."
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.740]   It is all there.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.380]   There is the child of God crying out for the satisfaction of all these new instincts and
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.380]   desires.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:33.020]   "More of thyself," he says, "less of myself."
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:42.740]   Let this poor self grow less and less, be thou my end and aim, and so on.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:54.340]   Thou elong'd to be delivered from the darkness, my darkness, vanish in thy light, thy life,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:38:02.620]   my death efface, the longing to be delivered, to be set free from self and sin and shame
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:09.020]   and failure and weakness, and to be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:14.780]   It is satisfied, all the instincts are satisfied when we are filled with all the fullness of
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.780]   God.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:23.620]   And that brings me to the last matter, and oh, what a terrible thing this problem of
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.260]   time is.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.740]   I am having to cut down these precious things, my friends.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:37.980]   I know it is inevitable in the world as it is today, but it is, I say, a tragedy.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.700]   But we must press on.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.560]   The last thing I want to say is this, that when a man is filled with all the fullness
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:51.300]   of God, every sense of want or of emptiness or of insufficiency is gone.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:56.380]   There is no more want, there is no more sense of emptiness and inadequacy.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.380]   Oh, there is endless teaching about this.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.940]   Let me just quote a few verses to you.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.700]   Do you remember what the Lord said to the woman of Samaria?
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.660]   He said it all to her.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:12.140]   "Whosoever," he said, pointing to that Jacob's well, "whosoever shall drink of this water
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:21.180]   shall thirst again, but whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him shall never
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.180]   thirst.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:28.100]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:33.460]   everlasting life, shall never thirst again."
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.300]   Now, can you thirst if you are filled with all the fullness of God?
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.540]   But you know, our Lord wasn't satisfied with saying that kind of thing once.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:50.620]   He says it again in John 6, 35, "He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.340]   believeth in me shall never thirst."
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   Are you hungry?
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.180]   Are you thirsting?
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.180]   Are you unhappy?
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.860]   Are you ill at ease?
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.420]   Do you sometimes find yourself not knowing what to do with the next hour?
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.980]   Have you got a sense of vagueness and of loss and of emptiness and of purposelessness?
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.020]   Or are you hungry and you're thirsty, you have no right to be?
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.140]   If you are, it simply means that you don't keep on going to Christ.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:22.820]   "He that cometh unto me, he that keeps on coming unto me," it means, "shall never hunger,
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.940]   and he that believeth in me shall never thirst, never."
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.820]   How can you thirst if you are filled with all the fullness of God?
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:40.300]   How can you hunger if life itself, life indeed, is within you?
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.460]   There are the promises of the Master.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.460]   Are they true?
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.460]   Are they fulfilled in practice, in life?
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:50.500]   Well, listen to the Apostle Paul answering in writing to the Philippians, chapter 4,
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:56.820]   verses 11 to 13, "Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in whatsoever
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.540]   state I am therewith to be content.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:07.700]   I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound; everywhere and in all things I
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:14.860]   am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:20.580]   I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me."
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:30.260]   He has got there, he is in a state in which he is never hungry and he is never thirsty.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:36.340]   He says it again in verses 18 and 19, "But I have all and abound."
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.860]   And he was in prison when he wrote that, remember?
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:45.900]   A prisoner in prison, in prisons as they were in those days, dank and dark, unhealthy, perhaps
[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:52.300]   chained to a prisoner, "I have all and abound.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.260]   I am full," he adds.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.900]   Of course he is, because he was filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:06.420]   And then, writing to the Philippians, he says, "But my God shall supply all your needs,"
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:13.940]   all of them, no exception, "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:19.140]   in glory in Christ Jesus."
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:26.860]   That is, to be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.620]   Christian people, do we know this?
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.420]   We are meant to.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.300]   This is Christianity.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.080]   Did you know that it was because of this and in order to make this possible that the Son
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.980]   of God left heaven and went to that cross on Calvary's Hill?
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.700]   If you weep at the thought of his death when you take the bread and the wine and as you
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.140]   try to contemplate the cross, well, I say put the right content into it.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.140]   He died not merely that you and I might be forgiven and saved from hell.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:03.260]   He died that you and I might be filled with all the fullness of God here in this life,
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:08.860]   not when you are dead and have passed into heaven and into glory, here and now in greater
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:13.300]   fullness there but full here, filled to the brim, here and now.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.700]   He is praying it for these Ephesians.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.100]   It is not a vague ideal he is setting up.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.380]   He is praying that they may know it as he himself knew it.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:29.660]   This is Christianity and I say that to be content with anything less than this is dishonoring
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.660]   to the Lord.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.660]   It is sinful.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.540]   Do not be content with the mere fact that you believe in Christ and that your sins are
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.820]   forgiven and that you are a church member.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.820]   Have you got this?
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.740]   Press on, I say.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.740]   Never give yourself rest nor peace.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:48.300]   Offer this prayer for yourself, for all of it, and go on and on and on until you know
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:53.780]   something of this blessed satisfaction and have realized something of this fullness.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:44:01.780]   Above all, I plead with you, do not think of it as a substance, as an it.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.940]   The fullness of God is not a substance.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:08.300]   Do not think in terms of analogies of pouring from a jug into a vessel.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   No, no.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.300]   It is personal.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.300]   It is God.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.620]   It is Christ dwelling within.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.660]   It is personal.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.180]   Concentrate on the person, therefore.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.700]   Go to the person.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.180]   Act on your faith and speak to him.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.060]   Tell him your wants and needs.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.060]   Wait upon him.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.700]   Spend your time with him.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:31.180]   And then he will give you of his fullness.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:41.060]   And then you will be able to say, "With another man, William Tidmattson."
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.820]   Do you know anything about him?
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.580]   Well, let me tell you hurriedly something about him.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.320]   His father was a great man in the political world, and this young man was a man of very
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.320]   great ability.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.500]   And he was destined for the political world and would have done brilliantly with all his
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:03.380]   shining faculties and powers, but while still in the early twenties, he had a profound evangelical
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.380]   experience.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.380]   He was converted.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.820]   He received new life.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.180]   And he gave up all that and he became a humble preacher of the gospel.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:22.460]   But this is how he describes it, "O blessed life, the heart at rest, when all without
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:33.940]   tumultuous seems, that trusts a higher will and deems that higher will not mine, the best,
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:41.100]   O blessed life, the mind that sees whatever change the years may bring, a mercy still
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:45.340]   in everything and shining through all mysteries.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:56.460]   And then to end, O life, how blessed, how divine, high life, the earnest of a higher,
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:07.180]   Savior, fulfill my deep desire and let this blessed life be mine."
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:15.780]   Shall we all offer that prayer together as we sing hymn number 415, 415, "O blessed
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:22.940]   life, the heart at rest, when all without tumultuous seems."
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:44.580]   "O blessed life, the heart at rest, when all without tumultuous seems, that trusts
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:47:10.980]   a higher will and deems that higher will not mine, the best, O blessed life, the mind
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:30.140]   that sees whatever change the years may bring, a mercy still in everything and shining through
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.140]   all mysteries.
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.140]   And then to end, O life, how blessed, how divine, high life, the earnest of a higher,
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.140]   Savior, fulfill my deep desire and let this blessed life be mine."
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:55.140]   "O fill me with thy fullness, Lord, until my very heart overflow; O Lord, let this blessed
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:04.780]   life be ours; hear our prayer, that we not only may be filled with this blessed fullness,
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:13.700]   but that we may live more evidently and obviously to all to the praise of the glory of thy grace.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:20.660]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:27.300]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:36.660]   of this our short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see that blessed
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:44.460]   face and rejoice together in glory, Amen."
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:48.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
