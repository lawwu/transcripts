[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Well, how do I recharge my spiritual battery?
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.780]   Where is my spiritual energy refreshed in order for me to meet yet another week of temptations
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.340]   and trials?
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.960]   This was the topic on the table for Pastor John earlier in the year when he was ministering
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.940]   in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.640]   This is a tremendous clip and I wanted to make sure it was shared with you in the podcast.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.400]   There's a story to come shortly and for that you need to know two other people.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.520]   You need to know Chuck Stedham, who is the longtime worship leader who served along Pastor
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.920]   John and you need to know Tom Steller, a longtime co-pastor with Pastor John.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.620]   There will be a scene in a moment with Chuck on stage leading musical worship and Tom to
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.360]   Pastor John's side during musical worship.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.120]   Here now is Pastor John talking about how we recharge for the Christian life, which
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.640]   is really a celebration of corporate worship.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.080]   Have a listen.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   The reasons that corporate worship, singing, praying, responsive readings, confessing
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.640]   our sins, preaching, is so uniquely powerful.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.320]   I want to use a superlative here.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.680]   That's risky because God shows up superlatively in one-on-one moments and you yourself alone
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.560]   with him moments and any one of those can be exquisite power.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:45.160]   But on the whole, I would say my sweetest communion with God happens with Chuck.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.560]   I mean Chuck is a symbol when I say that.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.280]   He was the leader in those moments and so what I mean is corporate worship.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.280]   Why is it?
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.160]   I've tried to...it just is.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.320]   I think it is because I was made for this and you were too.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.640]   You may be resisting it for all kinds of reasons, but you were made to see and savor God with
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.680]   his people in the manifold ways of corporate worship.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.320]   That's what you were made for.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.880]   And therefore, when you are experiencing it, you are experiencing something of the end
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.240]   for which you were made.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.160]   And that's deeply satisfying.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.640]   That's one reason.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.680]   Here's a second one that I've watched in myself.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.920]   Corporate worship becomes not only an awakening of affections that I did not bring into the
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   service.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.840]   I'm coming there to feed on what God is doing in that moment, on the truth there and on
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.200]   the beauty of our songs.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.720]   I'm being awakened to be who I am, being awakened to know God, love God, delight in God, be
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.640]   satisfied in God by song and the truth of the songs and the beauty of the songs.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.000]   There's something about profound biblical truth about God mingled with beautiful tunes
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.040]   that is uniquely effective in the soul of a human being.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   It's unique.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.280]   It just is.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   And so that happens.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.840]   Here's a third thing.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.320]   I can remember moments.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.800]   Here's Tom Steller, who's with me for 33 years, to my left.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.520]   And Tom was saved in the Jesus People Movement.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.120]   He's been a hand lifter from day one.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.760]   I had to be converted because I grew up in you know what.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   And so I'm sitting there singing, going through the motions because that's what happens.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.000]   You just lose, it doesn't always click, right?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.800]   You're just going through the motions and my eyes glance over and Tom is like this.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.360]   That very posture, knowing what I know about Tom was like an arrow repeatedly for my soul.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.920]   That's corporateness.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.040]   That's corporateness.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.260]   Me being near somebody who's engaged with God is convicting, right?
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.840]   If you're near somebody who's really authentically not putting on any show, they're just engaged,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.560]   they're loving God in their relationship with God and you're not, that's good for you.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.640]   You see?
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.400]   So that's another piece of it.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.920]   Here's the one that I probably remember most poignantly.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.400]   I mean, everybody thinks, "Oh yeah, you've been married for 50 years, cool, got five
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.000]   kids, you're still married, must be wonderful."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.560]   We've walked through such deep waters together, Noel and I, struggled with so many things.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.920]   Kid problems and marital problems in and out of counseling maybe for 33 months total over
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.320]   our 50 years and tried to love each other better, not hurt each other with what we do
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   or say.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.960]   And so I'm a pastor, right?
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.320]   We're talking about 33 years of sitting on the front pew with about five or six, 700
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.000]   people behind me and I'm going to preach in a few minutes and I'm singing and this is
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.600]   the worst week of our marriage, right?
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   What do you do?
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   How do you carry on?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.540]   How do you not be a hypocrite?
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:43.680]   And I cannot tell you how many times some beautiful expression of the mercies of God
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.600]   broke over me with such conviction of my selfishness.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.680]   I stayed married.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.000]   I felt hope again.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.200]   I think I can go home and say, "I'm sorry."
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.320]   I mean, where do you get the strength?
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.400]   I'm talking to the guys right now, okay?
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.740]   Same issue with the ego with the women, but it's a little different with the guys.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.740]   Where do you get the strength to just humble yourself and say, "I was wrong.
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.900]   I'm sorry."
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.780]   Or even if you don't think you were wrong, to say something sweetly conciliatory because
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.420]   that's your job.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:30.860]   I get it on the front pew in the middle of, I mean, we weren't singing His Mercy is More
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.180]   in those days, but it would do it today.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.020]   It would do it today.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.700]   So that's another piece.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:46.340]   And maybe one last reason why I exist when I'm a pastor, I exist to create a God-loving
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340]   people.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.180]   That's why I exist.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.620]   My preaching is designed to build truth about God into the mind and affections for God into
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.620]   the heart.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.060]   That's why I exist.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.180]   That's my whole life in corporate worship.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.740]   I can hear it happening.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.260]   I mean, even now I know, I mean, hundreds of people have come to Bethlehem since I left
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.580]   in 2013.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.820]   Half the people downtown don't know me.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.660]   I'm sitting there as the 33-year veteran and they don't know me.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.660]   That's awesome.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.020]   That's glorious.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:26.040]   But I also know half of these people were under my ministry so that when I'm four pews
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.540]   up from the back on the left-hand side under the balcony with Noel in our little spot and
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:39.380]   15 people around me that I can recognize and know have their hands in the air at some magnificent
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.740]   climax of a hymn to God's glory, I feel I didn't live in vain.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.220]   So those are a few reasons why those moments...
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.700]   One more, one more.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:01.500]   I got cancer, I got pancreatic cancer and the biopsy was on our anniversary, December
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.700]   21, 2005.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:15.660]   The surgery to take out the prostate gland was on Valentine's Day.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.780]   Between December 21 and February 14, those were the sweetest corporate worship experiences
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.420]   of my life because I didn't know I was going to live.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.800]   It's wonderful to get a cancer diagnosis and still live.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.980]   Everybody should get that opportunity.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.860]   Otherwise we take so much for granted.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:44.300]   So standing at the front pew for those...
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   What's that?
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.880]   About eight weeks or so?
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:54.580]   Every Sunday was more intense than ever and it was glorious.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:00.500]   If that was to me a foretaste of what it would be like to get ready to die when the cancer
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.940]   is not going to be healed anymore, that's okay.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.180]   That will be okay.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.380]   Incredible reminder of the eternal things happening in hearts on Sunday mornings in
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.220]   musical worship and just a great reminder of what Sunday morning represents for the
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.940]   people worshiping around us.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:25.100]   There's a lot happening in hearts as God recharges, confronts, builds up, and prepares people
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.380]   for a week of news that's unforeseen.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.060]   It's really amazing what's happening in that room together.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.780]   And thank you for listening along to the podcast.

[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.420]   It's a question from an elder with ramifications for each and every one of us.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.420]   That's next time.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.420]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
