[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:10.320]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.320]   a show about upgrading life, money and travel,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.600]   all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.880]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm on my own quest to find every hack there is.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.240]   And today I'm talking to Morgan Housel, author of the fantastic
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.880]   bestselling book, The Psychology of Money.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.400]   Timeless lessons on wealth, greed and happiness.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.480]   We'll be talking about behavioral finance, investing, dealing with risk
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.320]   and approaches you can take to be more productive with your money.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.240]   Morgan is a partner at the Collaborative Fund
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.280]   and a former columnist at The Motley Fool and The Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.080]   He's a two time winner of the Best in Business Award
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.920]   from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.240]   and a winner of the New York Times Sydney Award.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.640]   And before we jump in, if you're enjoying the show, I'd really love your help.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.960]   If you could either pick your favorite episode and share it with a friend
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.000]   or leave a five star review in the podcast app, I would really appreciate it.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.080]   All right, let's get to it.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.840]   Well, after one more quick thing, Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.760]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.800]   and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.520]   This podcast is for informational purposes only
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.960]   and should not be relied upon for investment decisions.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.920]   Morgan, thank you for being here.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.640]   Thanks for having me, Chris. Happy to be here.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.840]   So you've been writing columns, articles, blog posts about money
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.240]   and investing for almost 15 years.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.160]   What about the psychology of money led you to write an entire book this time?
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.000]   What what actually got me to write the book was just the realization
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.720]   that I had accumulated enough stories, enough material to fill out a book.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   That's the honest answer.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.080]   And it took a long time.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.000]   It took 10 or 15 years of casual observing and reading about a bunch of things
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.360]   that led me to find what I thought were the most important parts
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.920]   about how people think about money and kind of how I've always thought about this.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.200]   Not always, but the main way that I've written, not just written,
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.640]   but thought about and researched behavioral finance
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.760]   is through the lens of other industries.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.000]   And the reason that is, if I take you back to when I started writing about finance,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.920]   which was 2008, which, of course, is when the world fell apart.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.040]   The financial crisis, everything was breaking and crumbling down around us.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.000]   In my early years of becoming a financial writer,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.920]   I wanted to answer the question,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   why do people do the things that they did during the housing bubble,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   during the financial crisis?
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.240]   Why did they why do people take on so much debt?
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.560]   Why did they make all these dumb, crazy decisions that blew the world to pieces?
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680]   Why did they do it? That's what I want to answer.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.520]   And I realized as years went on, the answer to those questions
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.000]   could not be found in a finance textbook or an economics textbook.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600]   You could not explain why people did what they did
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.120]   if you were just looking at finance or thinking through the lens
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.920]   and the frameworks and the theories of finance.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.200]   Just the answers weren't there.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.640]   But you could find clues like these, like tangential clues
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.160]   about why people did what they did.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   If you were thinking about psychology and sociology
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.040]   and political science and biology and neurology,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.240]   like all these things that had nothing to do with finance
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.840]   could actually explain why people did the things that they did.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.160]   Things like sociology, like keeping up with the Joneses
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.640]   or like, you know, your brother-in-law buys a big house.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.120]   So now you've got to go buy a big house.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.440]   Finance can't explain that, but sociology can.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.720]   So to me that just started this idea that money is not the study of finance.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.000]   It's a study of how people behave, like how people behave with money.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.200]   And since it's a study of behavior, you can learn so much about it
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.040]   through the lens of all these other disciplines.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.520]   And so I spent the huge majority of my time,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.800]   I almost never read finance books or economic books.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   I read books about all kinds of different topics,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400]   just trying to answer the question, like how do people respond
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.000]   and behave around fear and greed and risk and uncertainty?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.040]   And just trying to piece together little bits and stories about how people behave.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   And so I just did that for many years,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.440]   more than a decade before I felt like I had enough
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.760]   to throw it all together into a book.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.640]   And that's where this came from.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.400]   Well, I'm glad you did.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.360]   When I was in college, my wife and I actually went to college together
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.720]   and she had a major in finance.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.640]   And all of a sudden she was like, "Wait, finance is all about..."
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.040]   And I remember specifically taking the Fundamentals of Futures
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.480]   and Options Markets with her as a course in college.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.440]   And she was like, "This isn't what I care about."
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.960]   Like, I was really interested in how people think about money.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.680]   I'm not interested in, you know, the Black-Scholes model for pricing options.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.600]   And so that actually, I think if your book was around,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.360]   she could have taken a different path.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.280]   But she got out of finance pretty quickly
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.160]   because it was not framed around how people think about money.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.920]   So that's actually a really good point, because the behavioral side of finance,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.760]   the psychology side of finance, is really hard to teach.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.320]   You can't, like even to really smart people, it's hard to teach.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.200]   So what tends to be taught in finance, in colleges and whatnot,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.720]   is the part that is relatively easy to teach.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.840]   There's all the formulas and the data and the charts,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.120]   the things that you can memorize and regurgitate on a test.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.480]   The softer side of finance is just, it's much more mushy.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.120]   It's much more like answering the question, like,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.640]   "How do you become a good spouse?"
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.440]   It's hard, you can't teach that in college.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.120]   It's a really important topic.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.440]   It might be the most important topic of your entire life,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.360]   but you can't summarize it into a formula, so you can't teach it.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.680]   And this is true for a lot of disciplines.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.760]   Like, what is taught in school are the things that are able to be taught,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.840]   like the things that you can teach.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.520]   But there's a lot of things that you just can't teach.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.080]   Like, how do you teach someone to respond well around greed and fear?
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.960]   Tough thing to teach that in a way that you're going to be able to
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.720]   test someone on a midterm for.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.400]   So it's a great point that you and your wife brought up about,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.320]   you know, how finance is typically taught
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.120]   versus what it actually is in the real world.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.640]   Yeah, and there's so much in the book about how to start thinking about different things.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.120]   Before going kind of deep on a few of those,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.840]   I'd love to talk a little bit about the ultimate goal of learning and mastering money.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   I think, you know, you have a pretty good framework for what that unlocks in life
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.440]   and kind of what the highest form of wealth is.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I'd love to hear you kind of talk a little bit about that.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.520]   To me, the highest form of wealth is you wake up every morning
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.800]   and you're going to say that you can do whatever you want today,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.040]   whatever you want to do.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.560]   Even if most of the time, what you want to do is wake up and go to work
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.640]   and be a productive member of society, it's on your terms.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.400]   You're doing it at the company you want for as long as you want.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.560]   You can live where you want.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.240]   You can work with the co-workers who you want.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.520]   Having a sense of independence and autonomy,
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.360]   being on your own terms, owning your time, owning your schedule,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.680]   having control over your schedule,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.480]   that to me is the highest form of wealth.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.360]   And it's important because everyone knows,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.040]   I mean, this is virtually cliche at this point,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.400]   but you get used to things, cars, homes, it's not that it's bad.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.280]   I like nice cars as much as anyone else,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.880]   but people get accustomed to them.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.480]   The joy that you get from them is going to wear for virtually anyone.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.800]   People massively overestimate how much joy you're going to get from stuff.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.920]   It's not that stuff is bad, you just overestimate it.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.240]   But owning your time, owning your schedule,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.640]   having independence and autonomy
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.080]   is something that I think will give you a permanent level of lasting happiness.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.120]   Or I think a better, like a little bit of nuance here is that
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.200]   it's not that having independence gives you, makes you happier,
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.960]   it's that it makes you less miserable.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.840]   Like people who don't control their time,
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.920]   you just have more bad days than people who have that level of independence.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.400]   So to the extent that people can use money and wealth and savings
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.640]   to gain autonomy in their life,
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.400]   that to me is like the highest form of wealth.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.760]   And there's a couple of things about it.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.280]   One is that for a lot of people,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.640]   the amount of wealth that you need
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.600]   to gain some level of independence and autonomy
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.560]   is a lot lower than I think what most people would consider rich.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   And the definition of rich is different for everyone throughout the world,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.000]   different people, different generations.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.120]   But having just a level of savings so that, for example,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.600]   if you were to lose your job,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.040]   you can wait to find a good job
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.000]   rather than having to take the first one that you can possibly find.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.680]   That's a level of independence
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.520]   that can make your life substantially better.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.240]   Having just enough savings that if you have a medical emergency,
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.480]   it's not going to ruin you,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.640]   which for whom it does millions of Americans every year,
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.520]   that's a level of independence and autonomy.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.080]   So obviously, independence is a spectrum.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.440]   A lot of people when they think of independence, they think
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.040]   the fire movement, retire early, quit your job,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.720]   go on a road trip around the country.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.680]   And that's one level.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.640]   But there's a big spectrum below that
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.400]   that can lead to a lot of happiness of just being in control of your time.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.120]   The other way that people talk about this
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.480]   is, of course, the well-known phrase "F you money."
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.000]   Like so much money that you can just say "F you" to people
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.040]   who you don't want to deal with.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   That's one level of this that gets talked about.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.840]   And I think there's like a more polite version of that.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.480]   I call it like, "Please leave me alone money."
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.040]   Of just like, if you have enough money, you don't have to deal
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.320]   with a lot of the hassles that you have in life.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.880]   You can just say like, "Look, I don't report to anyone.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.800]   I'm not on anyone else's, you know, quarterly performance metrics."
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.560]   You can just kind of live the life that you want
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.200]   and pursue the creative ventures that you want
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   in a way that I think is really underestimated in life.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.520]   Yeah, I think in today's environment,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.680]   I hear lots of people say, "Gosh, you shouldn't hold any cash.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.560]   The interest rates are so low that you actually forget that the value
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.800]   or the kind of return on that money that's sitting in cash
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.400]   can be something really, really significant
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.280]   if you are able to use it to turn down a job
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.080]   or you're able to use it to work less hours on your hourly job
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.640]   and pursue something you're excited about."
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.800]   So I'm a big fan of using cash to buy yourself freedom
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.960]   and treating that freedom as a similar return,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.000]   though very different from the kind of return
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.920]   that's more tangible of investment returns and that kind of stuff.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.640]   You're so right that people look at the return on cash
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.720]   and they say, "Look, 0.1% interest.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.120]   Like, why would I possibly do that?"
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.360]   And then once they hit, whether it's next month or five years from now,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   once they hit some sort of life emergency where they need that cash
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.600]   and they realize that cash is the oxygen of independence.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.480]   Like, you don't think about it until you need it.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.840]   And then when you need it, it's the most important thing in the world.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.240]   Nothing else matters.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.840]   And so I think once every 10 years, at least everybody,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.040]   everybody, once every 10 years,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.880]   will have something happens in their life where they think,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.800]   where they realize, "Oh, I'm so glad I had this buffer of cash
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.080]   that I didn't know what I was going to do with."
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.560]   Or, "Oh my gosh, I wish I'd, like, things would have been so much better
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.880]   if I had just saved a little bit of cash."
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.280]   Everyone will deal with that once every 10 years.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.960]   And during the other 99.9% of the time,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.600]   your cash feels like it's a drag on your net worth.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.920]   And then, you know, one week every 10 years,
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.200]   it's the most important thing that completely transforms your life
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.480]   because it gives you options over your time,
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.880]   over your control of about what you're going to do
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.000]   and where you have to go, et cetera.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.200]   Yeah. So building up that cash,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.160]   you know, there's lots of ways to do that.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.240]   And, you know, it ultimately comes down to having more money.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.880]   And, you know, you could save more or you can earn more.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.280]   And by earn more, you could work or make investments that grow.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.760]   I personally think that saving is much easier to focus on.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.480]   It's totally in your control.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.440]   But it seems like everyone I talk to is focused on making more money
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.800]   and usually making more money from investments and seeking high returns.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.120]   Why do you think it's so hard for people to save more and spend less?
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.560]   I think, look, both sides of the equation are really important.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.120]   Like, of course, earning more and like proper investing
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.360]   and like long-term compounding, that's so important, of course.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.480]   But I think the side of the equation, which is just,
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.600]   you know, like all of wealth is money in minus money out.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.400]   Like that's what it is.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.120]   And the money outside of the equation is just more in your control.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.800]   Like to double your money in the stock market over the next five years is doable,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.400]   but it's not always easy.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.760]   Like people who are new to investing might think that's crazy
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.240]   because it's been so easy lately.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.000]   But most of the time, like doubling your money in the stock market
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.440]   takes a lot of work and a lot of patience and a lot of just like sticking it through.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.440]   But lowering your expenses is so much more in your control
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.120]   because you have no control of what the stock market is going to do next.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.640]   But you do have control over how big your ego is
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   in terms of how much you need to flash and show the world how much money you have
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.600]   through the cars you're driving and the clothes you're wearing
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.800]   and the vacations that you're posting on Instagram.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.240]   Controlling that side is so much more in your control
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.120]   than assuming that you can have any control of what the stock market is going to do next.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.240]   So it's just, it's not that one side is more important than the other.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.120]   It's just, if you're looking at the odds of success
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.240]   and you're trying to find the highest odds of like,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.960]   what's the lever I can pull that when I pull it, it's actually going to make a difference?
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.360]   For the huge majority of people, it's on the spending side of the equation
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.400]   and that's how they can really move the needle in their life.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.760]   And, you know, things that are more in your control are just so much more valuable.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.520]   Like the expected value of something like that
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.720]   is so much more valuable than for most people
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.200]   to try to increase their income by a significant amount.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.640]   So, like, why don't people want to do that?
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.840]   I think there's two reasons.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.120]   One is what we talked about before, which is that when most people gain more income,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.040]   they instantly want to say, "How can I spend this?"
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   Because their view of money is the sole purpose of money is to buy stuff,
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.640]   which seems like a really rational statement.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.120]   That's what money is. Money is to buy stuff. That's what it's for.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.800]   That seems so obvious.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.600]   And even when I say it, I'm kind of like, "Yeah, of course, that's what it's for."
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.400]   And so, most people stop right there and they say,
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.600]   "Well, if I just got $1,000 raise, I'm going to go spend $1,000
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.880]   because that's what money is for."
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.320]   But I think once you view money as, "Oh, actually, this can give you independence
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.720]   if you save it and invest it and this gives you wealth,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.920]   now you have control of your time. Now, you can do whatever you want.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.200]   Now, when life throws a curveball at you, you're going to be okay."
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.360]   Then you start thinking about it a little bit different.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.040]   And so, if you don't have that little nuance on what money can do for you
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.720]   and the independent side of it, it makes savings much harder
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.480]   because you're saving money and you're saying, "What's the point of this?
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.760]   What am I saving it for if I'm not going to spend it?"
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.360]   That's how a lot of people think.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   Once you view it as, "I'm saving this so I can have control over my time,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.160]   so I can live whatever life I want,"
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.400]   then I think it becomes quite a bit easier to save.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.720]   So, that's always the lens that I viewed it through when saving for myself.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.760]   Is there anything you've learned about psychology that helps people
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.360]   who have gone through that exercise of, "Yeah, I do want my freedom,"
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.800]   but struggle with stopping themselves from wanting more,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.320]   stopping themselves from wanting the nicer car, the nicer house, or whatever it is?
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.080]   Is there any tactics that people can use to stop that feeling?
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.400]   No, I don't know if there's any specific tactics.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.120]   It's like the most natural thing in the world.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.240]   And even myself, who writes a book about this topic,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.760]   of course, it's tempting for my wife and I to say,
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.400]   "Hey, we gained a little bit of income from this or that.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.720]   Should we go buy a nicer..."
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.960]   That temptation never goes away, ever.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.840]   I think it's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.600]   It's natural from a social level to try to show your friends and your co-workers
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.800]   and your spouse or your potential future spouses
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.320]   that you've made it in the world.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.680]   Like, everyone... That's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.480]   Like, take your peacock feathers and flay them up and be like,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.240]   "Hey, look at me. This is what I've done."
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.760]   That's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.680]   And even if you're not thinking about it through the social sense,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.800]   the idea that nicer stuff will make you happier is true to some extent.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.560]   We just overestimate how much it's going to be true.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.400]   So, it's a really difficult thing.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.120]   I think that the people who find a way to do it
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.600]   are just the ones who are just totally comfortable in themselves
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.200]   and who they are and don't feel a lot of obligation or urge
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.080]   to try to gain the social ladder.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.360]   They're comfortable with their friends and their spouses
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.400]   or their significant others.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.120]   They're totally comfortable with that.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.120]   And those people love them and appreciate them.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.840]   And they just don't feel that much need to climb the social ladder.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.040]   They're happy where they are.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.280]   Those are the people that can really gain total control
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.600]   over their financial lives
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.720]   because they're not on just constant hamster wheel
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.360]   of trying to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.960]   And the Joneses thing is such a huge problem
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.840]   because there are a lot of Joneses
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.680]   and some of them are extremely wealthy.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.640]   So, no matter how much money you gain,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.320]   there's always someone who's making more than you.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.960]   And if you're making 50 grand,
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.320]   and then you're looking up to the person who's making 100.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.440]   And then once you make 100,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.040]   you're looking up to the guy who's making 200.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.880]   And that keeps going forever.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.400]   That never ends.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.480]   So, I use the example in the book of like,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.280]   if you are a professional baseball player,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.120]   the minimum wage is about half a million dollars per year,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.160]   which by any definition is rich.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.120]   Like in the United States,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.240]   you make half a million dollars a year.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.520]   Like you're crushing it.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.360]   You're like, congratulations, you made it, you're rich.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.120]   But I guarantee you that every minimum wage baseball player
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.960]   in professional baseball does not consider themselves rich
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.920]   because there's people on their team
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.600]   who make $10 million a year.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.880]   And the people who make 10 million
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.720]   might not feel that great
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.240]   'cause they're looking up to the players
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.400]   who make 30 million.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.560]   And the guy who makes 30 million
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.720]   is looking at the hedge fund manager
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.600]   who's making 500 million.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.280]   And the hedge fund manager who makes 500 million
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.720]   is looking at Jeff Bezos.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.760]   Like that never ends.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.280]   So people, once you realize,
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.560]   like I use this quote in the book of a friend of mine
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.320]   who goes to Vegas every year.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.600]   And one year he walked in and he asked the dealer,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.400]   he said, "Hey, what games do you play, Mr. Dealer?"
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.480]   Like in Vegas, what games do you play?
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.240]   And he said, "I don't play any games."
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.280]   He said, "The only game that you can win in Vegas
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.400]   "is not playing.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.000]   "That's the only way that you can win in Vegas
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   "is to like walk out of the casino."
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.240]   And I feel like it's the same with that,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.880]   like climbing the social ladder.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.240]   There's no end point.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.120]   So people are like, "I'm on this mission to win the game."
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.600]   It's like, no, you're never gonna win the game.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.000]   The game never ends.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.480]   So when you realize the game never ends
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.800]   and it can't be beat,
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.760]   then for myself, it's different for everyone,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.600]   but for myself, it's like,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.760]   well, if you can't beat the game,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.900]   I don't wanna play the game.
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.360]   I'm gonna try hard as I can not to play the game.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.120]   That's not a tip or a trick or a tactic in how to do it.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.680]   It's just a little bit different way of thinking about it.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   And I think it's such an ingrained part of human nature
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.260]   that it's never gonna be the point
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.000]   where the majority of people will be able to achieve it.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.640]   If you're mindful about the forces
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.300]   that are pushing you away from happiness with your money,
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.680]   maybe it's a little bit easier to wrap your head around.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.200]   - Do you think people can go too far to the other end?
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.920]   You mentioned the FIRE movement,
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.880]   which I was actually in a documentary
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.960]   about the FIRE movement called "Playing with FIRE."
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.320]   And I remember someone mentioning
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.400]   in the process of talking with lots of people
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.080]   that there's some people that like to wash their tinfoil,
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.400]   like some extreme things to save small amounts of money.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.360]   And I sometimes ask, and I've asked myself this question,
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.480]   it's like, can you go too far in that direction
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.240]   and end up with all of this money
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.400]   that gives you all this freedom,
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.040]   but you spent so many years not actually enjoying life?
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.360]   And what happens when you go too far?
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.800]   - I think the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.600]   And I think the biggest one
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.800]   is if you create this incredible frugal lifestyle
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.040]   and it turns off your friends and families
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.300]   and significant others in a way
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.200]   that they start rejecting you for it.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.800]   That's what people overlook.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.280]   So people are like, they might be being honest
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.000]   with themselves when they say,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.320]   "I would be happy living off of $4,000 a year,"
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.180]   whatever it is, and they're honest with themselves.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.440]   But their friends aren't, their spouse isn't,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.840]   their boyfriend and girlfriend isn't.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.320]   And then all of a sudden, this other part of your life
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.040]   that was probably the single most important part
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.280]   of your life, the people around you,
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.600]   your friends and families that you love
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.040]   start rejecting you for it.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.840]   I've seen that happen a number of times,
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.240]   and it's devastating to the people
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.800]   because they're like, "Look, I was honest
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.780]   "that I could live this life and be happy,
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.600]   "but these people who I loved weren't on the same page,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.560]   "and now I've ruined my life over it."
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.500]   That's the biggest risk in these things
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.280]   is that you create an extreme plan that you're okay with,
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.120]   but other people are not.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.960]   And it's a hard thing to wrap your head around.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.140]   And I think there are also a lot of people
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.140]   that go down a path that is fun for a while, but gets old.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.360]   It's fun to be super frugal for 12 months,
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.080]   but after three or four years, they're kind of over it.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.240]   But it's become part of your identity,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.280]   especially when there's a name behind it, the FIRE movement.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.760]   Like, "I'm in the FIRE club," it's a tribe.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.400]   And then sort of break off from the tribe
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.880]   is really difficult.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.400]   So once it becomes an ingrained part of your identity,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.480]   I think people find it hard to move on from,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.520]   even if they're ready to move on from it.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.100]   - Yeah, no matter how deep you go down the path
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.540]   of saving and frugality, I think at the end of the day,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.220]   you talked earlier, it's two sides of an equation.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.900]   The money comes in, the money goes out,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.060]   that's what you save.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.140]   So I do still think it's important to think about
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.140]   what you do with the money you save.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.540]   And when it comes to investing,
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.940]   I like to contrast athletes and investors.
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.780]   And it got me thinking,
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.860]   I have a lot of friends who played sports in college.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.380]   They all knew it was really hard to be a pro athlete,
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.420]   so most of them chose other careers.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.380]   And I talked to those same people
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.380]   who know that most active investors underperform,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.740]   and yet all of them are always trying to invest
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.260]   and beat the market and pick stocks
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.500]   and compare things on what's the return.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.820]   Why are people so rational in some areas
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.740]   and totally irrational when it comes to
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.320]   their abilities with money in the markets?
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.520]   - I think there's a really easy answer to that question,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.540]   and that's in professional sports,
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.540]   it's impossible to make it to the NFL by luck.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.620]   You have to be skilled, you have to be physically skilled,
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.460]   legitimately skilled to make it there.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.220]   But it is possible, and happens all the time,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.420]   that people can be successful in the stock market
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.680]   by luck alone.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.540]   So the fact that it's even possible
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.140]   is why people go into it.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.620]   And a lot of them will just fool themselves.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.140]   Maybe they had some sort of beginner's luck,
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.860]   they opened up a Robin Hood account,
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.940]   and they doubled their money in six weeks.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.540]   And they think to themselves, look, this is so easy.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.380]   And not only is it easy, but I have the skill.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.560]   Maybe other people can do it,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.280]   but if they know only 10% of people can beat the market,
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.720]   everyone thinks they're part of that 10%.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   And especially young men are the most susceptible
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.800]   to assuming, even if they know the odds,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.360]   like a lot of people think they're being rational
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.840]   'cause they're like, oh yeah, I know the odds.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.280]   Only 10% of investors who try to beat the market can do it,
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.540]   but I'm one of them.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.520]   And since it's possible to be in that group by luck alone,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.080]   then you have a lot more people chasing it.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.480]   The other aspect of this is that
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.280]   if you're trying to get into professional sports,
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.400]   it's really obvious whether you made it or not.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.440]   You got drafted or you didn't.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.480]   Black and white, clear as day.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.080]   But the huge majority of investors
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.760]   who I've talked to, active investors,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.880]   particularly if you're not a professional investor,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.360]   you're just an individual investor,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.920]   don't accurately track their returns.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.960]   And if you really ask them, like, how have you performed?
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.400]   A lot of them, if they're honest about it,
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.960]   they don't really know.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.240]   They're not auditing their annual returns
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.680]   and comparing it to the appropriate benchmark every year.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.820]   A lot of them do it,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.260]   and maybe they think they're outperforming,
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.400]   but if they're honest with themselves
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.000]   on an after-tax basis, they're actually not.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.040]   Or they're willfully blind to it
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.540]   because they're afraid to accurately calculate it.
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.480]   Because, and in the meantime, they like what they're doing.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.680]   And maybe that's, and that's fine.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.820]   If you like actively investing,
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.160]   even if you're underperforming, but you love it.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   You like the strategy, you like the hunt,
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.080]   you like the analysis, well then that's great.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.840]   That's a cool little hobby that you have.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.000]   No problem with that whatsoever.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.680]   But it's much easier to fool yourself
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.280]   that you can be a great investor
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.320]   than it would be in sports,
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.880]   where it's just obvious, clear as day.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.480]   You either made it or you didn't.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.660]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.500]   I get it.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.180]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.060]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:32.120]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.020]   and let our sponsor, Drizzly,
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.960]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.740]   take care of the supplies.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.560]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.400]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.820]   It could be your dog's birthday.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.800]   That the sun finally came out.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.280]   Or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.360]   that you got through another week.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.440]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.000]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.760]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.840]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.520]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.080]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.080]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.100]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.920]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.000]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.640]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.120]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.760]   So, whatever the occasion,
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.040]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.060]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.280]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   And how do you help people who, you know, like that,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.960]   they're having fun, they might be making some money
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.680]   or losing lots of money and help them understand
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.160]   why that might not be the best long-term strategy
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.360]   if their goal is to pursue this independence
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.960]   and be more confident getting there?
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.720]   - This might be a disappointing answer,
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.600]   but I found that for the large majority of these investors,
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.320]   you naturally end up on one side of the equation.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.960]   And once you're on that side of the equation,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.720]   it's hard to convert you to the other side.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.200]   You know, that's not to say that's not true for everyone,
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.640]   but a lot of people, if you are a hardcore active investor,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.040]   the odds that you will ever be persuaded
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.320]   to go onto the passive side,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.400]   even if your returns are horrendous, are not that great.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.120]   I think for a lot of people, they're scratching,
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.640]   when they're actively investing,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.520]   they're scratching a natural itch that they have,
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.360]   and that itch needs to be scratched.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.320]   And if they were passively investing,
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.840]   they would have this itch that would drive them crazy.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.440]   And therefore, that's, so they're always gonna do it.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.840]   If there is a way that, like,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.960]   I've seen a lot of financial advisors do this,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.720]   is they say, okay, I know you have this itch
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.560]   that needs to be scratched, you need to trade,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.600]   you need to actively invest
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.120]   because that's part of your personality.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.480]   Can we put 70% of your net worth
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.880]   in a long-term diversified investing plan,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.800]   and then you can trade with 10, 20, 30%,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.120]   so that you can, look, you have this core
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.240]   that's gonna, this is kind of, you know,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.280]   this is the big thrust that's gonna get you into retirement,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.200]   but you can still trade.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.680]   We're not gonna take that away from you.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.160]   I think that's actually,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.520]   like, if you're thinking about it rationally,
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.080]   that's the wrong thing to do
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.840]   because either one strategy works or it doesn't,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.360]   so why are you gonna straddle both?
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.120]   But for a lot of investors,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.200]   I think that's the right thing to do
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.800]   because it keeps them engaged.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.400]   And rather than just getting too bored
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.080]   with their investments, they're like, look,
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.480]   I still have this pocket where I can day trade
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.560]   and buy these stocks and I feel great about it.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.000]   So just giving them that outlet to scratch that itch
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.840]   I think is really important
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.480]   and probably the best way to try to,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.720]   if you were to convert people from one side to the next.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.280]   But the other thing I would say here
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.920]   that's really important is I'm not a passive zealot.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.720]   I'm not one of the people who says everyone should index
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.200]   and no one can beat the market and you shouldn't even try.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.080]   Those investors exist, but I'm not one of them.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.040]   I've become much less judgmental
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.680]   as an investor over the last decade
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.480]   when I just realized everyone has different goals,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.520]   different skills, different needs, different desires.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.080]   They view the world through a different lens.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.120]   Like I view the world through the life that I've lived
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.320]   and only through that lens.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   It's the only world that I know is what I've seen.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.920]   And the world that I've seen is different
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.320]   from the world that you've seen.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.600]   And the world that you and I have seen
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.400]   is very different from different generations,
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.440]   people who live in different countries.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.800]   Like everyone is different.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.560]   So to say that there's one right way to invest
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.400]   is something that I probably used to believe,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.200]   but I've become much less judgmental as the years go on.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.920]   - Yeah, and you mentioned in the book a lot
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.040]   that people, even that might be similar,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.640]   similar geography, similar income, similar job,
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.160]   might be trying to play a different game.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.240]   They might be anticipating more money from inheritance.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.720]   They might be trying to earn some short-term money
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.760]   or really focused on a different goal.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   So it's interesting to hear how people compare themselves
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.560]   to people that might be in totally different circumstances.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.760]   - Yeah, I think about myself in college.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.840]   There was a social aspect of wearing nicer clothes
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.760]   and trying to put the peacock feathers up again.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.400]   When I was in college, when I was looking for a girlfriend,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.240]   when I was looking for a wife,
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.040]   when I was in that market, that was really important.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.160]   Now that I'm happily married
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.560]   and my wife loves me till death do us part,
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.960]   it's a lot less important for me.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.040]   So even myself, over the course of my relatively short life,
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.480]   like the game has changed substantially
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.840]   in terms of who I wanna be,
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.280]   who I wanna show the world that I am.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.520]   That has changed substantially in my own life.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.120]   So if it changes within your own life in a 15-year period,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   then think about people who are different generations,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.640]   people who live in different countries,
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.200]   different amounts of rich countries, poor countries.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.480]   Everyone thinks about these things totally different.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.120]   The other thing I would say is a couple of years ago,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.080]   I was in Australia where they hadn't, at the time,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.560]   they hadn't had a recession in 29 years.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.560]   29 years with no recessions.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.440]   So virtually every adult had never seen a recession, ever.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.200]   And then you compare that to the United States
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.720]   where 2001, 2008, we had these massive recessions
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.440]   that reshaped all of society.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.960]   And Australians who, of course, just as smart as us,
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   had the same information as us,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.320]   they're the same people as,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.200]   they had a completely different view on what risk is.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.400]   And at the time, Americans were very cognizant of like,
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.040]   the world can fall apart at any moment,
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.160]   you can lose everything, you can just poof.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   And Australians didn't, just didn't have that view.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.840]   And it's not that we were right and they were wrong,
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.960]   that's not the right way to look at it.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.280]   It's just, we're equally smart people,
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.440]   the same people that have very different views on the world
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.920]   just by the dumb luck of where we were born.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.320]   - Yeah, do you think there's any way
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.960]   that people can start to, I don't know,
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.600]   force themselves to learn these lessons?
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.440]   I know anytime you're looking to start investing,
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.960]   you get often asked or find things on the internet say,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.640]   you know, figure out whether you're comfortable
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.080]   with a 30% downturn.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.160]   And it's easy if you invested all of your money
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.520]   and that downturn happened and you got to know,
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.920]   oh, here's what I did.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.480]   But for many people, these things happen every 10 years
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.120]   or in Australia, every 30 years.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.960]   Like, how can you start to understand
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.560]   your own tolerance for this before you see it?
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.800]   Or can you?
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.760]   - I don't, I think realistically,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.960]   you probably can't until you've done it.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.120]   Because there's no formula.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.600]   It would be one thing if it was like,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   oh, you just need to know the formula,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.400]   just go read the book and then it'll tell you what to do.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.520]   But nobody knows who they are
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.280]   until they've been in the trenches.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.520]   No one understands their own unique personality.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.040]   And there are a lot of people who are very calm personality,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.320]   even like an even disposition.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.280]   They don't panic very much in life,
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.320]   but they've never experienced losing half their money
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.280]   in the stock market.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.400]   And when they do, they realize that's the trigger
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.520]   that'll make them lose their minds.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.360]   So even if you are very introspective
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.480]   about who you are in general,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.640]   I don't think people understand who they are financially
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.280]   until they've experienced some of these big declines.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.640]   And I've experienced 2008,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.720]   I experienced March of 2020 last year,
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.120]   but there's a lot of things financially
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.080]   that I haven't experienced as well.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.520]   I have not, and you have not lived through a period
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.440]   of sustained high inflation that hasn't existed
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.560]   since the mid, late 1970s.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.880]   So I can research that.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.320]   I can try to be empathetic with people who lived through it.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   I can try to put myself in their shoes at the time,
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.080]   but until I've lived through it,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   I can't reasonably say that I know
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.200]   how I would respond to it.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.840]   And I think if we're being honest,
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.400]   that's true for a lot of people.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.880]   Virtually no one, in the developed world at least,
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.840]   had any idea how they would respond to a viral pandemic
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.920]   until last February.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.240]   It just wasn't something that was necessarily on our mind.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.040]   And I think a lot of people responded in ways
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.360]   that they wouldn't have fathomed before.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.160]   It was completely normal before last February.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.280]   If you're on a plane and someone's coughing,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.080]   99% of people, not a big deal.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.800]   Someone's coughing, it's not a big deal.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.920]   Now going forward, if someone coughs on a plane,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.320]   people are gonna lose their minds.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.800]   They have a totally different view
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.240]   that they never would have considered before it happened.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.400]   I'll give you one very extreme example of this,
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.600]   and I have to preface this with like,
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.560]   this is the most extreme example.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.400]   There's a book called "What We Knew,"
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.560]   and it's a book interviewing German civilians
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.080]   on what they knew during World War II,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.200]   during when the Nazis were in power.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.600]   What did the civilians know?
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.640]   Not the guards at Auschwitz, the German civilians.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.480]   What did they know?
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.760]   What was going on?
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.920]   And there's this passage in the book
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.880]   where this German civilian said,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.520]   look, when Hitler came to power in 1933,
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.160]   the Germans were fully behind them.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.120]   We were like, rah, rah, like, Hitler, this is great.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.240]   And they said, why?
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.080]   Like, I don't understand.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.600]   Can you explain why you were so excited about him?
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.160]   And the civilian said, look,
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.880]   in the 1920s, Germany lost everything.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.360]   The economy fell apart.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.200]   We lost everything.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.040]   No one had a job.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.160]   We lost all of our wealth.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.840]   And Hitler came along and said, I'll give you a job.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   We're gonna rebuild the country.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.120]   We're gonna bring back German pride, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.800]   And in that situation where people were so desperate
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.760]   for anything, they looked at him and said,
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.320]   great, that's my guy.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.200]   And they're looking at this in hindsight and saying,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.760]   look, when people are in a desperate situation
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.120]   where they don't have any money,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.160]   they lost all their jobs, they lost everything,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.760]   people will cling to things in that situation
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.640]   that they never would have imagined.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.200]   You'll cling to the craziest person that comes across
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.800]   if he's willing to give you a little bit of hope.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.000]   That's the most extreme example,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.040]   but nobody knows what they're gonna do
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.120]   or how they're gonna react in the heat of the moment
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.600]   when things are really uncertain,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.800]   when you've lost a lot of money,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.280]   when you've lost your job.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.560]   People, like, when things are calm and prosperous,
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.800]   people don't know how they're gonna respond
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.200]   during those heated moments
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.120]   until you've actually experienced it.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.800]   - Yeah, I think in the pandemic,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.640]   I work at Wealthfront
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.720]   and we have a passively managed portfolio
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.560]   and we have risk tolerance questions and we ask,
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.360]   how are you gonna feel if the portfolio's down?
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.600]   And people overestimate what they think.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.760]   They say, well, if the market's down 20%,
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.520]   I'm gonna buy more 'cause it's on sale.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.440]   But one of the interesting things
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.080]   that happened during the pandemic
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.640]   was some people made the complete different decision
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.440]   and not because they didn't think the market was on sale,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.960]   because it wasn't a 20% down,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.480]   it was a 20% down in the middle of a pandemic
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.520]   where some people are shouting from television
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.680]   that the world could end and half the world could die
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.720]   and like all of these extreme things.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.560]   And that feels very different than the academic exercise
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.240]   of if something goes down 20%, what do you do?
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.520]   And I personally think the media makes it even harder
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.360]   to know what to do because it's really extreme.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.200]   So that to me was like a great example
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   of the risk tolerance questionnaire
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.440]   isn't sufficient in isolation.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.280]   - You're absolutely right.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.840]   Because if you were to ask me, Morgan,
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.360]   how would I feel if the market fell 30%?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.760]   If you were to ask that question,
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.120]   I imagine, when I'm trying to picture that,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.960]   I imagine a world where everything is exactly the same today
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.080]   except stock prices are 30% cheaper.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.200]   And in that world, it seems like an opportunity.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.360]   Everything is the same except cheaper stock prices,
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.440]   that's a good opportunity.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.880]   But that's not how it works.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.920]   The reason the market falls 30%
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.440]   is because the banking system is about to collapse,
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.200]   like 2008, where there's a pandemic
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.000]   that might kill your entire family.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.200]   And in that context, totally different scenario.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.840]   And that's why people are just in general pretty poor
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.160]   at forecasting the risk tolerance
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.760]   and how they might behave during the next big decline.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.680]   - Forgetting major market declines,
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.160]   just thinking of poor investment decisions,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.720]   which I think right now there's this big rise
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.560]   of active trading.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.800]   And I'm sure you have opinions like I do
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.040]   about the gamification of investing
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.120]   and what that causes people to do.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.800]   But for people who are making decisions
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.160]   that end up being wrong,
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.320]   I think something I took away from the book
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:15.720]   and I've seen in practice is that you just will be wrong.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.840]   And I think something that I'd love you
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.680]   to talk a little bit about
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.200]   is how can people get comfortable with that concept,
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.240]   which is like, if you're a doctor,
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.840]   you don't want to be okay being wrong 20, 30% of the time,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.400]   but as an investor, that's okay, and that's expected.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.760]   - Yeah, like obviously if you're a pilot,
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.880]   then you have to be right 100% of the time.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.640]   Like you can't say, "Oh, I really botched this flight,
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.040]   but I got next time to come."
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.760]   But investing is not like that.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.360]   There's a thing that Benjamin Graham talked about
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.840]   in one of his books, where he said,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.240]   "Investors need to understand the difference
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.560]   between a positive and a negative art."
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.800]   And he said, "Investing in stocks was a positive art,
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.280]   because all you need to do to do well
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.400]   is make sure that you own the good ones."
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.760]   If you pick 100 stocks and 80 of them suck,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.440]   but five of them are the next Apple,
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.720]   the next Amazon, the next Facebook,
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.040]   you're gonna do incredible.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.800]   Even if 80% of the ones you picked go bankrupt.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.240]   So investing is a positive art.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.200]   He said, "Owning bonds is a negative art,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   because what you need to do to do well as a bond investor
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.480]   is make sure that you don't own any of the bad ones.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.840]   Any of the bonds that are gonna default,
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.960]   you just need to avoid all of those."
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.480]   So it's important to realize,
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.760]   is what you're doing in life,
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.240]   and this applies to everything in life,
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.640]   like careers and friends,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.480]   is it a positive or a negative art?
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.120]   Are you trying to find, is it just important
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.920]   that you find the one or two good ones,
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.640]   or is it important that you really avoid
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.240]   the one or two bad ones?
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   And investing in the stock market, again,
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.360]   is a positive art,
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.040]   which means that it is completely normal
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.080]   in every scenario, no matter how you're investing,
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.280]   if you're an index fund investor,
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.560]   if you're a stock picker, if you're a trader,
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.720]   whatever it is,
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.520]   that you're gonna make the majority of your lifetime returns
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.080]   from a small minority of the stocks that you pick.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.320]   Even in an index fund,
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.600]   I mean, the stuff that's pretty incredible
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.040]   is that in a 40-year period,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:58.720]   from 1980 to 2020, the Russell 3000 Index,
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.920]   which is an index of large stocks in the United States,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.680]   of 3,000 companies in the United States,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.200]   40% of the components in the Russell 3000
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.960]   effectively went out of business
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.360]   over this 40-year period.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.840]   40% of the components.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.560]   But the index itself had average annual returns
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.320]   of like 11% per year.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.200]   The index did really well,
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.520]   but 40% of the companies in the index went out of business.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.760]   And that's in an index fund.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.920]   That's not like a crazy stock picking strategy.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.520]   Even in an index fund,
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.720]   like almost half of the companies that you invest in
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.880]   won't make it, and that's fine.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.920]   That's totally normal.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.440]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.360]   And the other example I use in the book
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.320]   is Benjamin Graham himself
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.520]   was a very successful fund manager
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.960]   over the course of his life.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.360]   But 100%, and he writes about this.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.440]   He was open about this.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.920]   100% of his career success
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.600]   is owed to one investment that he made, Geico.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.960]   If you take his career track record and remove Geico,
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.280]   his track record is completely average.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.160]   And Buffett has talked about this as well, too,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.000]   from Berkshire Hathaway.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.880]   If you take out the top five or 10 investments
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.720]   they've ever made, Berkshire's track record is average.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.800]   And so that's how successful investing works.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.760]   No matter what your strategy is,
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.680]   you don't need to be right all the time.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.760]   You just have to be right some of the time.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.040]   And I think a big part of this is if you invert that
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.880]   is that good investing
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.360]   is not about consistently making great decisions
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.640]   because nobody does.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.520]   It's about consistently not screwing up so much
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.080]   that you're kind of pushed out of the game.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.840]   Like it's consistently making sure
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.120]   that you don't make these catastrophic blunders
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.080]   that are gonna ruin everything.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.240]   But if you can stick around long enough
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.640]   and make enough bets
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.960]   or just have enough annual returns under your belt,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.360]   you're probably gonna do well over time,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.480]   even if you're gonna experience not just some,
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.320]   but a significant amount of underperformance
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.960]   and loss during that period.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.840]   And one of the way to think about this,
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.440]   there's a study from Morningstar a couple of years ago
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.280]   that looked at the best performing mutual funds of all time.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.200]   These are just cherry picking with hindsight
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.000]   what mutual funds had the best returns
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.560]   over like a 30-year period.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.240]   And the common denominator of the top three funds,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.080]   I forget what the funds were,
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.720]   but the common denominator that they shared
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.240]   is that they spent almost 40% of the time of their life
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   underperforming their benchmark.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.880]   So these are cherry picking with hindsight the best funds.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.160]   And if you actually own these funds,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.800]   almost half the time you are underperforming your benchmark.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.320]   So it's not easy for people to wrap their heads around that,
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   that tails drive everything,
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.720]   that it's just the kind of the tail ends
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.920]   of the bets that you make
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.680]   and the years that you're around
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.520]   that are gonna drive everything.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.080]   But that's how markets work over time,
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.200]   whether it's for stock picking
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.440]   or just long-term index investing.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.880]   - Yeah, the two takeaways for me is,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.360]   if you're picking something that has the long-term nature
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.800]   of underperforming 40% of the time,
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.720]   you need to be long-term in the way you pick it
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.200]   and take a bet that can pay off over time.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.480]   And you talk about compounding,
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.800]   and I think it's something that
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.240]   as much as it's been drilled in our heads our whole lives,
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.000]   it's something that you still need to kind of recognize.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And then the second is that you need to make multiple bets.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.880]   I hear this in Silicon Valley a lot
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.000]   when people say, "I wanna start angel investing."
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.120]   And everyone says, "Okay, well, if you wanna do that,
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.360]   "you need to one, make enough bets
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.200]   "that you might find something that succeeds.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.800]   "And that hit rate is so low
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.340]   "that you need to have enough money to make 20, 30 bets.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.840]   "But you also need to have so much money
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.400]   "that angel investing isn't your whole portfolio
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.760]   "because you might not get those lucky, you might not."
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.840]   And so I think when you can take the approach
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.960]   of lots of things for a long time, that's great.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.160]   But taking the approach of, "I'm gonna pick one stock
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.640]   "and try to make money this year,"
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.040]   I think is, it gets risky.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.360]   And I feel like we've kind of gamified that in recent past.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.520]   - I feel like for all investing,
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.960]   what you're trying to do is just put the odds
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.760]   of success in your favor.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.440]   And the way that you're gonna do that
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.280]   in a world where tails drive everything,
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.300]   the way to put the odds of success in your favor
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.240]   is to be, yeah, to be taking a lot of bets
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.440]   and to be sticking around for a long period of time.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.120]   The more bets you have, the longer you're sticking around,
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.560]   the higher the odds that you're gonna end up owning
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.400]   the great companies and you'll be around during the years
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.440]   that they achieve all of their returns.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.600]   And you're gonna spend a lot of time
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.240]   where those companies aren't performing,
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.120]   the market isn't performing,
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.360]   but if you stick around long enough
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.960]   and if you have enough bets,
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.480]   the odds fall firmly in your favor.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.440]   - Yeah, one framework that a really good friend of mine
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.640]   gave me, because inevitably you're gonna make
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.520]   a bad decision when it comes to your money.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.120]   He always asked me, he's like, "Hey, but wait,
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.360]   "I know you're beating yourself up
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.500]   "for making the wrong investment or doing the wrong thing,
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.180]   "but did you make the right decision
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.000]   "with the information you had at the time?"
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.800]   And in one example, it was, "I wanna make this thing
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.280]   "a higher percentage of my portfolio,
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.080]   "and I chose a day to do that,
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.480]   "where the next day it dropped significantly."
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.440]   And he goes, "Yeah, but at the time,
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.680]   "was that part of your strategy?"
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.500]   I was like, "Yes."
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.400]   And he's like, "Well, then you made the right decision,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.980]   "and you beat yourself up when you make bad decisions
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.700]   "with information, but don't beat yourself up
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.600]   "when you make the right decision, but it goes wrong."
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.440]   - Yeah, completely.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.640]   I mean, we only know one version of history,
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.320]   the version that happened.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.760]   And if we're just looking at a short period of time
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.720]   over the last 12 or 16 months,
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.880]   we know the version of history that happened,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.920]   which was the government came out
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.080]   with trillions of dollars of stimulus packages.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.400]   We created incredible vaccines
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.160]   that were distributed very quickly,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.200]   and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.700]   That's the history that we know.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.640]   But it could have been so much different.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.420]   It could have been that Washington
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.740]   had a bunch of partisan squabbles,
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.080]   and there was no stimulus package.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.640]   We didn't make vaccines.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.840]   You could easily imagine a world
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.500]   where economically and health-wise,
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.120]   the world completely collapsed last year.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.880]   You could easily imagine that occurring.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.400]   And if that world occurred,
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.480]   then the people who sold their stocks last March
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.840]   would look like geniuses.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.000]   And that world easily could have occurred.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.480]   Just the fact that it didn't
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.120]   doesn't mean that we should ignore the fact
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.680]   that it easily could have.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.520]   That's true for, I think, 2008 as well.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.080]   You can so easily imagine a world
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.800]   where after Lehman Brothers collapsed,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.400]   Merrill Lynch, and then AIG,
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.200]   and then Citigroup, and then Bank of America,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.820]   all collapsed as well.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.520]   And in that world, which so easily could have happened,
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.720]   we probably would have been looking at
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.160]   the second version of the Great Depression.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.800]   That didn't happen, but it so easily could have.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.480]   So I think, just to your point,
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.940]   when people make a decision
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.960]   with the information that they have at their time
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.920]   based off of the consequences of what might happen
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.400]   in these situations in the future,
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.440]   I think it's easy to beat yourself up
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.480]   because all we have now
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.200]   is a version of history that happened.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.240]   But I think it's really important,
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.160]   and I think the smartest thinkers
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.440]   are totally comfortable looking at the histories
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.740]   that easily could have happened
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.300]   and how they prepared for them,
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.660]   even if in hindsight,
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.860]   it looks like it wasn't the best decision.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.420]   With the information that you had at the time,
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.380]   it may have actually been a great decision.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.740]   - I just want to thank you, Quick,

[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.700]   - Yeah, I mean, you wrote in the book
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.340]   that the most important economic events of the future,
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.180]   things that move the needle the most,
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.340]   are things that history gives us no guide about.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.260]   They're unprecedented, like what we saw last year.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.580]   Knowing that, how do we use history
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.140]   as a guide for what to expect?
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.700]   You know, we always have the disclosure
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.420]   past performance does not reflect future gains,
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.620]   but so much of investing is,
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.380]   well, the stock market generally goes up,
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.560]   so we should invest in it.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.300]   - Jason Zweig is a great writer
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.140]   from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.780]   He made this point one time that
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.820]   it's not that investors don't learn from history,
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.940]   it's that they learn too precise a lesson from history.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.640]   So his example was after the dot-com bust,
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.220]   the lesson that people learned was
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:34.180]   when the P/E ratio exceeds 30, the market is too expensive.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.060]   That's a lesson that people took away.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.460]   But the actual lesson from the 1990s was
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.820]   overconfidence leads to trouble.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.820]   So people learn, they just learn a very over,
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.620]   they just learn a very precise lesson.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.780]   And since they learned a precise lesson,
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.500]   what they should have learned was
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.440]   overconfidence leads to trouble,
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.580]   but they didn't learn that lesson,
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.900]   so they took their money and they went
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.620]   and started flipping condos in Miami, or whatever it was.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.900]   So when you learn, when you look at history
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.720]   and you learn really precise lessons,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.500]   they're not gonna teach you much about the future.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.280]   Because like you said, the biggest events
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.180]   that's gonna shape the rest of our lives
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.380]   are surprises that you and I or no one else
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.940]   can be talking about today.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.780]   So to me, the way to learn from history
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.660]   is looking back and taking the biggest, broadest,
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:18.020]   30,000 foot level views and takeaways about human behavior.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.860]   About how people respond around risk and greed
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.980]   and fear and overconfidence and surprises.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.940]   Like how do people behave around those events?
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.780]   Not the very specific, granular takeaways.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.100]   I mean like, if you were to look at the last
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.380]   12 or 16 months, you can have a lot of
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.020]   specific takeaways about supply chains
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.820]   and we should have had more N95 masks
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.220]   and the CDC should have had better preparedness, et cetera.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.180]   Those are like really specific takeaways.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.440]   And depending on what your job is,
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.060]   those might be good takeaways.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.860]   But for most people, the most important lesson
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.460]   in the last 16 months is there are things
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.980]   that can happen in the world that you're never thinking about
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.980]   that can completely upend all of your assumptions
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.060]   about the future.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.100]   Whenever you're surprised in a situation
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.940]   like we all have been in the last 16 months,
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.780]   the best takeaway is that the world is surprising.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.220]   It's not to look at what happened and saying,
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.500]   how can we make sure this never happens again?
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.460]   It's looking at the situation and saying,
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.860]   a surprise is going to happen again.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.340]   And I think once you do that, then financially,
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.960]   it pushes you much more towards having room
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.680]   for error in your finances.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.840]   If I knew all the risks in the future,
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.160]   I would be able to plan around that really effectively.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.400]   I would know that in 2023, there's going to be a recession
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   that starts in February.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   So I'm going to have this cash set aside for that.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.800]   But nobody knows that.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.200]   And once you realize that we don't know
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.400]   what the future holds, it makes you much more comfortable
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.080]   being like, I have this big chunk of cash sitting here
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.400]   and I don't know what it's for.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.720]   I don't know what I'm going to need it for.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.380]   I don't know what I'm going to use it for,
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.080]   but I'm confident that at some point in the future,
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.000]   the world is going to break in some way
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.760]   that I can't forecast or predict right now,
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.680]   but the world's going to break in some way
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.320]   and I'll be glad it's there.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.200]   Once you become just a little bit more open and flexible
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.000]   with that room for error in your finances,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I think that's the only way that you can navigate a world
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.600]   where risk is what we don't see.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.560]   - Yeah, you started this whole conversation off
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.840]   saying that the basics of finance, the models,
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   the formulas are what we teach in school
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.000]   because it's way harder to teach all of this stuff.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.180]   And you just mentioned a lot of the history,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.060]   you have to interpret it differently,
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.700]   which makes me question,
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.060]   is there a path towards educating people
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.820]   more about this earlier?
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.380]   Should this stuff be in schools?
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.900]   Should this stuff be in colleges?
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.100]   How do we help people learn these lessons
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.340]   or at least start to understand these concepts
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.260]   that aren't just formulas earlier and more broadly
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.620]   so that people don't make as many mistakes
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.260]   and are better off?
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.940]   - There's a German professor named Gerhard Geigerenser
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.980]   who kind of teaches the science of risk.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.200]   And he made this point that in school,
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.340]   we pretty much only teach the math of certainty.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.340]   We teach algebra and trigonometry,
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.000]   which are maths of certainty,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.380]   like gives you very precise answers.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.080]   And instead, what we should be teaching more of
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.640]   is the math of uncertainty, like probability and statistics.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   And that is taught in school,
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.540]   but it's secondary to the math of certainty.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.120]   Like the kind of math that teaches you precise answers
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.680]   is that's the first priority.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.920]   And then if maybe in college,
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.360]   you can take a course on probability,
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.680]   but that's secondary.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.320]   He was saying like, that should be flipped.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.760]   We should be teaching kindergartners
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.040]   and second graders about probability
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.440]   because that's the math that really matters in the world.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.360]   You're gonna use on a daily basis.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.200]   Algebra is important,
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.600]   but you're not gonna use algebra on a daily basis
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.720]   unless you have some job,
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.320]   you're a math professor or something.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.000]   99% of people will not use algebra on a daily basis,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.480]   but 100% of people will use probability on a daily basis.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   They might not know it.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.960]   They're not actually doing the math,
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.920]   but probability impacts every hour of your life.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   And the decisions that you make in life
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.040]   rely on understanding how probability works.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.580]   And we rarely teach it.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.840]   It's a math of uncertainty.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.880]   This gets back to what I was saying earlier about
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.660]   what's taught in school is what's easy to teach.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.260]   And certainty is easy to teach
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.280]   'cause you come up with a formula
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.120]   that gives you the right answer.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.720]   Probability where it's like,
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.120]   there's all these unknown worlds.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.260]   And by definition, it's like,
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.880]   we don't necessarily know what's gonna happen.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.240]   Those are harder to teach.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.320]   They're harder to wrap your heads around,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   but they're what really matter in the world.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.240]   So if I were king for a day, so to speak,
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.320]   I think I would probably follow Gary Giegranzer's advice
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.880]   and say, flip it around.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.040]   We should start with the math of uncertainty
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.960]   that really makes a difference in your life.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.880]   And as you get older and more specialized,
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.600]   then maybe we can talk about calculus and algebra.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.200]   - And since neither of us are king for a day
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.280]   to make this change,
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.220]   are there ways that you think someone with kids
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.080]   that are in school right now
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.600]   could start to help them learn these lessons?
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.960]   - I think if we're just talking about investing,
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.440]   if you start investing and you own a couple stocks,
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.600]   you own a couple index funds,
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.760]   and you do it for a couple of years,
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.440]   you'll learn a lot about risk just through experience.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.320]   You're gonna experience the market going way up,
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.480]   the market going way down,
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.120]   and that will teach you a lot just by learning.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.280]   You're in the trenches getting your hands dirty.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.300]   I think that's the best way, I would say,
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.360]   to teach people about risk and uncertainty
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.240]   is just being thrown in.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.080]   Now, a lot of investors who started investing
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.320]   in the last year,
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.800]   all they've experienced is the market going
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.720]   not just up, but way up.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.280]   Like, that's what they know.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.560]   So the last year of experience
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.520]   has not been a very good lesson
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.880]   because you're not really getting the full side of risk.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.500]   You've only learned half the equation.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.360]   You really gotta be investing for a couple years
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.840]   through a couple of cycles before you're like,
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.040]   "Okay, I get it."
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.860]   And then you start viewing the bull markets as like,
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.140]   "Hey, this is cool, but this isn't gonna last,
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.740]   "and a lot of this is gonna unwind,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.600]   "and it's gonna hurt a lot when it does,
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:37.360]   "but I'm okay with that 'cause I've lived through this before."
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.280]   I think that's really the only way to do it
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.960]   is with your own money, your own skin in the game,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.240]   getting your hands dirty.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.000]   - Yeah, and I totally agree here.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.880]   I wouldn't advocate for what I'll propose
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.400]   to be any significant portion of your money,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.800]   but a conversation I had with a friend, an investor,
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.320]   last week was about cryptocurrency,
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.520]   and he pointed out that one of the most fascinating lessons
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.680]   about cryptocurrency that he's seen
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.440]   is that there's such extreme volatility, right?
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:08.000]   You could go up and down 50% almost in a day,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.180]   that it's taught him more about market crashes
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:15.680]   and bull markets in the shortest amount of time possible,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.640]   and it made me think, "Gosh, I don't think people
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.120]   "should put all of their money in cryptocurrency
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.800]   "by any stretch of the means," and that's not the advice,
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.120]   but if you want to learn through investing,
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.240]   it could be a way to accelerate your learning
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.960]   because it has just such extreme volatility.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.040]   I totally buy that, 100%.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.600]   I mean, I'm in the same boat as you
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.440]   in terms of recommending crypto,
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.400]   but I absolutely buy that argument 100%.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.020]   - Well, before we wrap,
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.840]   we've talked a lot about money and risk.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.720]   Are there any main takeaways that you think people
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.120]   should leave this conversation with?
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.640]   - To me, the biggest thing that I think
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.880]   is the most important part of behavioral finance
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.800]   and is maybe the one of the most overlooked
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.880]   is that in order to do well,
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.400]   you have to become introspective about who you are
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.480]   and realize that you are different from me,
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.780]   and we're all different,
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.160]   and the only way that you can really understand
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.520]   and master the behavioral side of finance
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.640]   is just really taking a look at who you are personally,
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.000]   not reading about other people or other people's situations,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.960]   but just being honest with yourself about your own skills,
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.720]   your own weaknesses, your own risk tolerance,
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.800]   your own goals in life, and that's different for everyone,
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.520]   and that's why a lot of people don't,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.820]   like most people want one answer,
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.200]   like what's the right thing to do?
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.400]   And when you become introspective about who you are
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.980]   and realize that everyone's different,
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.480]   you realize that people come to different conclusions,
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.480]   and what's the right decision for you, Chris,
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.280]   might be the wrong decision for me,
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.280]   even if we're roughly the same age.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.840]   People come to different things,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.240]   so I would just implore people
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.360]   to spend a little bit more time
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.480]   looking at themselves in the mirror
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.720]   and try to figure out who they are
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.880]   and what their risks and goals are.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:46.760]   - That makes total sense,
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.580]   and I'd like to end all these conversations.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.000]   This is a show called All The Hacks,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.080]   and today I would say it's a little different than some
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.800]   where it wasn't kind of running through
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.440]   very tactical things you can do,
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.920]   but really reframing psychology and money
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.520]   as something that if you can really start
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.320]   to understand how things work,
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.760]   you can probably hack your mind
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.320]   to start to be a more rational,
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.160]   or at least a more reasonable, as you say,
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.480]   investor and more reasonable with money.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.560]   But I will ask, are there a few kind of like life hacks
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.960]   or in any genre for you that are things that you do
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.800]   that people have often commented
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.880]   are fascinating or interesting that you'd wanna share?
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.300]   - I'll leave you with one financial hack
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.600]   that might disappoint you,
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.100]   but it's the only hack that works,
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.240]   and it works incredibly well in finance.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.720]   You wanna do well in finance?
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.080]   Spend less money than you make and be patient.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.880]   That's 90% of what finance is.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.420]   If you can actually do those,
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.040]   you have a black belt in finance.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.480]   It's the only hack that I think really truly works
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.200]   in a way that moves the needle.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.400]   - Yeah, I don't disagree.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.080]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.760]   Where can people find out more
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.000]   about what you're writing and everything you do?
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.720]   - My book is The Psychology of Money,
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.200]   and I spend most of my time on Twitter.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.380]   My handle is @MorganHausel, first and last name.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.860]   That's where most of my stuff is posted.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.700]   - Cool.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:52:59.540]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.380]   This was great.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.200]   - This was fun.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.040]   Thanks very much.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.860]   - Wow, I really loved this episode.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.900]   If you did too, please consider sharing it
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.820]   with a friend or family member,
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.680]   or leave us a five-star review in the podcast app.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.820]   I know this episode didn't have
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.340]   as many quick hacks as some others,
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.500]   but like Morgan said,
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.420]   if you can master some of the bigger mindset changes,
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.300]   you can really position yourself well with money.
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.060]   If you have any thoughts or feedback,
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.140]   please get in touch by email,
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.780]   chris@allthehacks.com, or @hutchins on Twitter.
