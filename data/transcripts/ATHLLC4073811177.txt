[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.080]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.040]   life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.360]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm on my own quest to find every hack there is.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.360]   And today I'm talking to Morgan Housel, author of the fantastic bestselling
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.280]   book, The Psychology of Money, Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.320]   Happiness. We'll be talking about behavioral finance, investing, dealing
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.480]   with risk, and approaches you can take to be more productive with your
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.200]   money. Morgan is a partner at the Collaborative Fund and a former
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.760]   columnist at The Motley Fool and The Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.600]   He's a two-time winner of the Best in Business Award from the Society of
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.000]   American Business Editors and Writers and a winner of The New York Times
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Sidney Award. And before we jump in, if you're enjoying the show, I'd
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.120]   really love your help.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.840]   If you could either pick your favorite episode and share it with a friend or
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.520]   leave a five-star review in the podcast app, I would really appreciate it.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.280]   All right, let's get to it.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.080]   Well, after one more quick thing.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.320]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.240]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.280]   and do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.000]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.520]   Morgan, thank you for being here.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.800]   Thanks for having me, Chris. Happy to be here.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.440]   So you've been writing columns, articles, blog posts about money and
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.760]   investing for almost 15 years.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.680]   What about the psychology of money led you to write an entire book this time?
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.880]   What actually got me to write the book was just the realization that I had
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.200]   accumulated enough stories, enough material to fill out a book.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.240]   That's the honest answer.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.440]   And it took a long time.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.080]   It took 10 or 15 years of casual observing and reading about a bunch of
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.880]   things that led me to find what I thought were the most important parts
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.320]   about how people think about money and kind of how I've always thought about
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.880]   this. Not always, but the main way that I've written, not just written, but
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.440]   thought about and researched behavioral finance is through the lens of other
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.960]   industries. And the reason that is, if I take you back to when I started
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.080]   writing about finance, which was 2008, which of course is when the world fell
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.440]   apart, the financial crisis, everything was breaking and crumbling down around
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.560]   us. And my early years of becoming a financial writer, I wanted to answer the
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.440]   question, why did people do the things that they did during the housing bubble
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   during the financial crisis?
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.800]   Why did they, why did people take on so much debt?
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.640]   Why did they make all these dumb, crazy decisions that blew the world to
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.840]   pieces? Why did they do it?
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.600]   That's what I wanted to answer.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.040]   And I realized as years went on, the answer to those questions could not be
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.520]   found in a finance textbook or an economics textbook.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.360]   You could not explain why people did what they did if you were just looking at
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.000]   finance or thinking through the lens and the frameworks and the theories of
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.120]   finance, just the answers weren't there, but you could find clues like these,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   like tangential clues about why people did what they did.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.960]   If you were thinking about psychology and sociology and political science and
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.240]   biology and neurology, like all these things that had nothing to do with
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.320]   finance could actually explain why people did the things that they did.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.560]   Things like sociology, like keeping up with the Joneses or like, you know,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.520]   your brother-in-law buys a big house, so now you got to go buy a big house.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.920]   Finance can't explain that, but sociology can.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.240]   So to me, that just started this idea that money is not the study of finance.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.520]   It's a study of how people behave, like how people behave with money.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.240]   And since it's a study of behavior, you can learn so much about it through the
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.560]   lens of all these other disciplines.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.600]   And so I spent the huge majority of my time, I almost never read finance books
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.320]   or economic books.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.720]   I read books about all kinds of different topics, just trying to answer the
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.480]   question, like what, how do people respond and behave around fear and greed and
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.920]   risk and uncertainty, and just trying to piece together little, little bits and
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   stories about how people behave.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.320]   And so I just did that for many years, more than a decade before I felt like I
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.240]   had enough to throw it all together into a book.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.120]   And that's where this came from.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.840]   Well, I'm glad you did.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.880]   When I was in college, my wife and I actually went to college together and she
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.720]   had a major in finance and all of a sudden she was like, wait, finance is all
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.120]   about, and I remember specifically talking, taking the fundamentals of
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.920]   futures and options markets with her as a course in college.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.480]   And she was like, this isn't what I, like, I was really interested in how
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.400]   people think about money.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.160]   I'm not interested in, you know, the Black-Scholes model for pricing options.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.080]   And so that actually, I think if your book was around, she could have taken a
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.000]   different path, but she got out of finance pretty quickly because it was not framed
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.640]   around how people think about money.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.440]   So that's actually a really good point because the behavioral side of finance,
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.200]   the psychology side of finance is really hard to teach.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.800]   You can't like, even to really smart people, it's hard to teach.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   So what tends to be taught in finance in colleges and whatnot is the part that is
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   relatively easy to teach.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.920]   There's all the formulas and the data and the charts, the things that you can
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.560]   memorize and regurgitate on a test.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.920]   The softer side of finance is just, it's much more mushy.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.560]   It's much more like, like answering the question, like, how do you become a good
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.080]   spouse?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.880]   It's hard, you can't teach that in college.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.560]   It's a really important topic.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.040]   It might be the most important topic of your entire life, but you can't summarize
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.800]   it into a formula, so you can't teach it.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.440]   And what, this is true for a lot of disciplines, like what is taught in school
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.200]   are the things that are able to be taught, like the things that you can teach.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.960]   But there's a lot of things that you just can't teach.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.520]   Like, like how do you teach someone to respond well around greed and fear?
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.000]   Tough thing to, to, to teach that in a way that you're going to be able to test
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.200]   someone on a midterm for.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.320]   So that's, it's, it's actually, it's, it's a great point that you and your wife
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.200]   brought up about, you know, what is, how finance is typically taught versus what
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.560]   it actually is in the real world.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   And, and there's so much in the book about how to start thinking about different
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.640]   things before going kind of deep on a few of those.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.960]   I'd love to talk a little bit about the ultimate goal of learning and mastering
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.320]   money.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.560]   I think, you know, you have a pretty good framework for what that unlocks in life
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.880]   and, and kind of what the highest form of wealth is.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.400]   And I'd love to hear you kind of talk a little bit about that.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.560]   To me, the highest form of wealth is you wake up every morning and you're going to
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.960]   say, you're going to say that you can do whatever you want today, whatever you
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.440]   want to do.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.400]   Even if most of the time, what you want to do is wake up and go to work and be a
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.680]   productive member of society.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.040]   It's on your terms.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.880]   You're doing it at the company you want for as long as you want.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.000]   You can live where you want.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.600]   You can work with the coworkers that you want.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.480]   Having a sense of independence and autonomy, being on your own terms, owning
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.080]   your time, owning your schedule, having control over your schedule.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.920]   That to me is the highest form of wealth.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.800]   And it's important because everyone knows, I mean, this is so, this is
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.360]   virtually cliche at this point, but you get used to things, cars, homes, it's not
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.880]   that it's bad.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.240]   I like nice cars as much as anyone else, but people get accustomed to them.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.920]   The joy that you get from them is going to wear for virtually anyone.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.200]   People massively overestimate how much joy you're going to get from stuff.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.320]   It's not that stuff is bad.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.280]   You just overestimate it.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.400]   But owning your time, owning your schedule, having independence and autonomy is
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.440]   something that I think will give you a permanent level of lasting happiness.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.240]   Or I think a better, like a little bit of nuance here is that it's not that having
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.360]   independence gives you, makes you happier, is that it makes you less miserable.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.160]   Like people who don't control their time just have more bad days than people who
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.360]   have that level of independence.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.840]   So to the extent that people can use money and wealth and savings to gain
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   autonomy in their life, that to me is like the highest form of wealth.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.200]   And there's a couple of things about it.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.880]   One is that for a lot of people, the amount of wealth that you need to gain
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.320]   some level of independence and autonomy is a lot lower than I think what most
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.080]   people would consider rich.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.120]   And the definition of rich is different from for everyone throughout the world,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.880]   different, different, different people, different generations, but having just a
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.080]   level of savings so that, for example, if you were to lose your job, you can wait
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.120]   to find a good job rather than having to take the first one that you can possibly
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.000]   find, that's a level of independence that can make your life substantially better.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.160]   Having just enough savings that if you have a medical emergency, it's not going
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.600]   to ruin you, which for whom it does millions of Americans every year, that's
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.960]   a level of independence and autonomy.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.520]   So like, obviously independence is a spectrum.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.160]   A lot of people when they think of independence, they think, they think the
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.920]   fire movement, retire early, quit your job, go like on a road trip around the
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.040]   country, and that's one level, but there's a big spectrum below that, that can lead
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.840]   to a lot of happiness of just being in control of your time.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   And the other way that people talk about this is of course, like the well-known
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.560]   phrase, F you money, like so much money that you can just say F you to people who
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.520]   you don't want to deal with.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.840]   That's one level of this that gets talked about.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.280]   And I think there's like a more polite version of that.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.400]   I call it like, please leave me alone money of just like, you know, if you have
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.800]   enough money, you just, you don't have to deal with, with the, with a lot of the
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.760]   hassles that you have in life.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.360]   You can just like, look, I, I'm not, I don't, I don't, I don't report to anyone.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.280]   I'm not on anyone else's, you know, quarterly performance metrics.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.240]   You can just kind of live the life that you want and pursue the creative ventures
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.800]   that you want in a way that I think is really underestimated in life.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.400]   I think in today's environment, I hear lots of people say, gosh, you shouldn't
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.120]   hold any cash.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.000]   It's, it's the interest rates are so low that you actually forget that the value
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.480]   or, or the kind of return on that money that's sitting in cash can be something
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.000]   really, really significant if you are able to use it to turn down a job, or you're
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.400]   able to use it to work less hours on your hourly job and pursue something you're
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.040]   excited about.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.880]   So I'm a big fan of using cash to buy yourself freedom and treating that freedom
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.360]   as, as a similar return, though, though, very different from the kind of return
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.320]   that's more tangible of investment returns and that kind of stuff.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.800]   You're so right.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.120]   The people look at the return on cash and they say, look, 0.1% interest.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.560]   Like, why would it possibly do that?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.080]   And then once they hit, whether it's next month or five years from now, once they
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.520]   hit some sort of life emergency where they need that cash and they realize that
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.760]   cash is the oxygen of independence, like you don't think about it until you need
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   it.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.320]   And then when you need it, it's the most important thing in the world.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.600]   Nothing else matters.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.720]   And so I think once every 10 years, at least everybody, everybody, once every 10
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.480]   years, we'll have something happens in their life where they think, where they
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.920]   realize, oh, I'm so glad I had this buffer of cash that I didn't know what I was
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.680]   going to do with, or, oh my gosh, I wish I'd like, things would have been so much
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.360]   better if I had just saved a little bit of cash.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.600]   Everyone will deal with that once every 10 years.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.000]   And during the other 99.9% of the time, your cash feels like it's a drag on your
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.960]   net worth.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.560]   And then, you know, one week, every 10 years, it's the most important thing that
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.080]   completely transforms your life because it gives you options over your time, over
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.880]   your control of about where you, what you're going to do and where you have to
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.520]   go, et cetera.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.640]   So building up that cash, you know, there's, there's lots of ways to do that.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.560]   And, you know, it ultimately comes down to having more money and, you know, you
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.320]   could save more or you can earn more.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.920]   And by earn more, you could work or make investments that grow.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.160]   I personally think that saving is much easier to focus on.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.880]   It's totally in your control, but it seems like everyone I talk to is focused on
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.960]   making more money and usually making more money from investments and seeking high
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.520]   returns.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.640]   Why do you think it's so hard for people to save more and spend less?
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.920]   I think, look, both sides of the equation are really important.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.120]   Like, of course, earning more and like proper investing and like long-term
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.680]   compounding, that's so important, of course.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.000]   But I think the side of the equation, which is just, you know, like all of wealth
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.920]   is money in minus money out.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.800]   Like that's what it is.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.920]   And the money outside of the equation is just more in your control.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.160]   Like to double your money in the stock market over the next five years is doable,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.760]   but it's not always easy.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.960]   Like people who are new to investing might think that's crazy because it's been so
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.600]   easy lately.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.960]   But most of the time, like doubling your money in the stock market takes a lot of
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.760]   work and a lot of patience and a lot of just like sticking it through.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.320]   But lowering your expenses is so much more in your control because you have no
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.400]   control of what the stock market is going to do next.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.520]   But you do have control over how big your ego is in terms of how much you need to
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.040]   flash and show the world how much money you have through the cars you're driving
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.160]   and the clothes you're wearing and the vacations that you're posting on Instagram.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.120]   Controlling that side is so much more in your control than assuming that you can
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.440]   have any control of what the stock market is going to do next.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.560]   So it's just it's not that one side is more important than the other.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.640]   It's just if you're looking at the odds of success and you're trying to find the
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.760]   highest odds of like, "What's the lever I can pull that when I pull it, it's
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.280]   actually going to make a difference?"
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.720]   For the huge majority of people, it's on the spending side of the equation.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.800]   And that's how they can really move the needle in their life.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.160]   And, you know, things that are more in your control are just so much more valuable.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.720]   Like the expected value of something like that is so much more valuable than for
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.600]   most people to try to increase their income by a significant amount.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.320]   So, like, why don't people want to do that?
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.200]   I think there's two reasons.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.480]   One is what we talked about before, which is that when most people gain more income,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   they instantly want to say, "How can I spend this?"
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   Because their view of money is the sole purpose of money is to buy stuff,
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.960]   which seems like a really rational statement.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.680]   That's what money is.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.720]   Money is to buy stuff.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.520]   That's what it's for.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.200]   That seems so obvious.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.920]   And even when I say it, I'm kind of like, "Yeah, of course, that's what it's for."
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.680]   And so most people stop right there and they say, "Well, if I just got $1,000 to raise,
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.240]   I'm going to go spend $1,000 because that's what money is for."
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.680]   But I think once you view money as, "Oh, actually, this can give you independence
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.080]   if you save it and invest it, and this gives you wealth.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.200]   Now you have control of your time.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.320]   Now you can do whatever you want.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.600]   Now when life throws a curveball at you, you're going to be okay."
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.760]   Then you start thinking about it a little bit different.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.440]   And so if you don't have that little nuance on what money can do for you
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.160]   and the independence side of it, it makes savings much harder.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.880]   Because you're saving money and you're saying, "What's the point of this?
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.120]   What am I saving it for if I'm not going to spend it?"
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.720]   That's how a lot of people think.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.680]   Once you view it as, "I'm saving this so I can have control over my time,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.600]   so I can live whatever life I want,"
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.840]   then I think it becomes quite a bit easier to save.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.400]   So that's always the lens that I viewed it through when saving for myself.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.160]   - Is there anything you've learned about psychology that helps people
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.760]   who have gone through that exercise of, "Yeah, I do want my freedom,"
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.200]   but struggle with stopping themselves from wanting more,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.680]   stopping themselves from wanting the nicer car, the nicer house, or whatever it is?
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.120]   Is there any tactics that people can use to stop that feeling?
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.840]   - No, I don't know if there's any specific tactics.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.520]   It's like the most natural thing in the world.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.640]   And even myself, who writes a book about this topic,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.160]   of course, it's tempting for my wife and I to say,
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.720]   "Hey, we gained a little bit of income from this or that.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.160]   Should we go buy a nicer..."
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.320]   That temptation never goes away, ever.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.240]   I think it's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:54.000]   It's natural from a social level to try to show your friends and your co-workers
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.120]   and your spouse or your potential future spouses
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.320]   that you've made it in the world.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.200]   That's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.840]   Take your peacock feathers and flay them up and be like,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   "Hey, look at me, this is what I've done."
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.120]   That's the most natural thing in the world.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.080]   And even if you're not thinking about it through the social sense,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.160]   the idea that nicer stuff will make you happier is true to some extent.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.960]   We just overestimate how much it's going to be true.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.800]   So it's a really difficult thing.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.520]   I think the people who find a way to do it
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.840]   are just the ones who are just totally comfortable in themselves and who they are
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.400]   and don't feel a lot of obligation or urge to try to gain the social ladder.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.840]   They're comfortable with their friends and their spouses or their significant others.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.520]   They're totally comfortable with that.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.440]   And those people love them and appreciate them.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.240]   And they just don't feel that much need to climb the social ladder.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.440]   They're happy where they are.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.960]   Those are the people that can really gain total control over their financial lives
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.760]   because they're not on just constant hamster wheel of trying to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.360]   And the Joneses thing is such a huge problem
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.040]   because there are a lot of Joneses and some of them are extremely wealthy.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   So no matter how much money you gain,
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.600]   there's always someone who's making more than you.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.280]   And if you're making 50 grand,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.680]   and then you're looking up to the person who's making 100.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.400]   And then once you make 100, you're looking up to the guy who's making 200.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.240]   And that keeps going forever.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.200]   That never ends.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.920]   So I use the example in the book of like,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.000]   if you are a professional baseball player,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.440]   the minimum wage is about half a million dollars per year,
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.520]   which by any definition is rich.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.600]   Like in the United States, you make half a million dollars a year.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.880]   Like you're crushing it.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.120]   You're like, "Congratulations, you made it. You're rich."
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.680]   But I guarantee you that every minimum wage baseball player
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.280]   in professional baseball does not consider themselves rich
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.840]   because there's people on their team who make $10 million a year.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.000]   And the people who make $10 million might not feel that great
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.640]   because they're looking up to the players who make $30 million.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.040]   And the guy who makes $30 million is looking at the hedge fund manager
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.800]   who's making $500 million.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.000]   And the hedge fund manager who makes $500 million is looking at Jeff Bezos.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Like that never ends.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.600]   So people, once you realize...
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.520]   Like I use this quote in the book of a friend of mine who goes to Vegas every year.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.920]   And one year, he walked in and he asked the dealer.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.640]   He said, "Hey, what games do you play, Mr. Dealer?
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.720]   Like in Vegas, what games do you play?"
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.560]   And he said, "I don't play any games."
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.680]   He said, "The only game that you can win in Vegas is not playing.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.200]   That's the only way that you can win in Vegas is to like walk out of the casino."
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.280]   And I feel like it's the same with that, like climbing the social ladder.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.480]   There's no end point.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.360]   So people are like, "I'm on this mission to win the game."
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.880]   It's like, no, you're never going to win the game.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.240]   The game never ends.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.040]   So when you realize the game never ends and it can't be beat,
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   then for myself, it's different for everyone.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.160]   But for myself, it's like, well, if you can't beat the game, I don't want to play the game.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.640]   I'm going to try hard as I can not to play the game.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.400]   That's not a tip or a trick or a tactic in how to do it.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.960]   It's just a little bit different way of thinking about it.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.920]   And I think it's such an ingrained part of human nature
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.320]   that it's never going to be the point where the majority of people will be able to achieve it.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.560]   If you're mindful about the forces that are pushing you away from happiness with your money,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.400]   maybe it's a little bit easier to wrap your head around.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.520]   Do you think people can go too far to the other end?
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.440]   You mentioned the FIRE movement, which...
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.320]   I was actually in a documentary about the FIRE movement called "Playing with Fire."
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.360]   And I remember someone mentioning in the process of talking with lots of people that
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   there's some people that like to wash their tinfoil, right?
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.720]   Like some extreme things to save small amounts of money.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.080]   And I sometimes ask, and I've asked myself this question, it's like,
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.320]   "Can you go too far in that direction and end up with all this money that gives you all this
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   freedom, but you spent so many years not actually enjoying life?
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.640]   And what happens when you go too far?"
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.080]   I think the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.120]   And I think the biggest one is if you create this incredible frugal lifestyle,
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.280]   and it turns off your friends and families and significant others
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.520]   in a way that they start rejecting you for it.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.040]   That's what people overlook.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.680]   So people are like...
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.360]   They might be being honest with themselves when they say,
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.760]   "I would be happy living off of $4,000 a year, whatever it is."
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.280]   And they're honest with themselves, but their friends aren't.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.720]   Their spouse isn't.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.160]   Their boyfriend and girlfriend isn't.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.480]   And then all of a sudden, this other part of your life that was probably the single
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.560]   most important part of your life, the people around you,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.280]   your friends and families that you love start rejecting you for it.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.560]   I've seen that happen a number of times, and it's devastating to the people.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.080]   Because they're like, "Look, I was honest that I could live this life and be happy.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.960]   But these people who I loved weren't on the same page.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.880]   And now I've ruined my life over it."
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.120]   That's the biggest risk in these things is that you create an extreme plan that you're
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.560]   okay with, but other people are not.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.280]   And it's a hard thing to wrap your head around.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.480]   And I think there are also a lot of people that go down a path that is fun for a while,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.680]   but gets old.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.000]   It's fun to be super frugal for 12 months, but after three or four years, you're kind
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.400]   of over it.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.480]   But it's become part of your identity, especially when there's a name behind it.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.280]   "Fire Movement."
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.160]   I'm in the fire club.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.000]   It's a tribe.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.640]   And then to break off from the tribe is really difficult.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.360]   So once it becomes an ingrained part of your identity, I think people find it hard to move
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.120]   on from, even if they're ready to move on from it.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.720]   No matter how deep you go down the path of saving and frugality, I think at the end of
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.480]   the day, you talked earlier, it's two sides of an equation.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.280]   The money comes in, the money goes out, that's what you save.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.440]   So I do still think it's important to think about what you do with the money you save.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.280]   And when it comes to investing, I like to contrast athletes and investors.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.200]   And it got me thinking, I have a lot of friends who played sports in college.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.680]   They all knew it was really hard to be a pro athlete.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.760]   So most of them chose other careers.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.840]   And I talked to those same people who know that most active investors underperform, and
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.160]   yet all of them are always trying to invest and beat the market and pick stocks and compare
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.840]   things on what's the return.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.280]   Why are people so rational in some areas and totally irrational when it comes to their
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.600]   abilities with money in the markets?
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.840]   I think there's a really easy answer to that question.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   And that's in professional sports, it's impossible to make it to the NFL by luck.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.200]   You have to be skilled.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.720]   You have to be physically skilled, legitimately skilled to make it there.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.440]   But it is possible and happens all the time that people can be successful in the stock
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.880]   market by luck alone.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.400]   So the fact that it's even possible is why people go into it.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.920]   And a lot of them will just fool themselves.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.600]   Maybe they had some sort of beginner's luck.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.280]   They opened up a Robin Hood account and they doubled their money in six weeks.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.840]   And they think to themselves, look, this is so easy.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.640]   And not only is it easy, but I have the skill.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.840]   Maybe other people can do it.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.720]   But if they know only 10% of people can beat the market, everyone thinks they're part of
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.040]   that 10%.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.080]   And especially young men are the most susceptible to assume, even if they know the odds.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.640]   Like a lot of people think they're being rational because they're like, oh yeah, I know the
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.120]   odds.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.600]   Only 10% of investors who try to beat the market can do it.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.800]   But I'm one of them.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.600]   And since it's possible to be in that group by luck alone, you have a lot more people
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.400]   chasing it.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.840]   The other aspect of this is that if you're trying to get into professional sports, it's
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.680]   really obvious whether you made it or not.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.040]   You got drafted or you didn't.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.200]   Black and white, clear as day.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.440]   But the huge majority of investors who I've talked to, active investors, particularly
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.840]   if you're not a professional investor, you're just an individual investor, don't accurately
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.200]   track the returns.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.160]   And if you really ask them, how have you performed?
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.560]   A lot of them, if they're honest about it, they don't really know.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:15.600]   They're not auditing their annual returns and comparing it to the appropriate benchmark
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.000]   every year.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.200]   A lot of them do it and maybe they think they're outperforming, but if they're honest with
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.760]   themselves on an after-tax basis, they're actually not.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.480]   Or they're willfully blind to it because they're afraid to accurately calculate it.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.800]   And in the meantime, they like what they're doing.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.000]   And maybe that's fine.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.880]   If you like actively investing, even if you're underperforming, but you love it, you like
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.520]   the strategy, you like the hunt, you like the analysis.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.320]   Well, that's great.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.240]   That's a cool little hobby that you have.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.360]   No problem with that whatsoever.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.960]   But it's much easier to fool yourself that you can be a great investor than it would
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.240]   be in sports, where it's just obvious, clear as day, you either made it or you didn't.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.760]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.320]   emerge.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.440]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual processes
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.520]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:10.960]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, 1, 37,000.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.400]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.960]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.200]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.600]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.880]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.000]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.400]   not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:40.000]   And one, because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.560]   all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.

[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.120]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.720]   for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.680]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.840]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250-year-old
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.240]   tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.280]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.360]   commonly found in plants.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.800]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep, because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.840]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel-friendly.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.320]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.120]   for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.240]   metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good, and probably one of my favorite
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.560]   things to drink.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.160]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.080]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.640]   Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.600]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers free
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.240]   U.S. shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.880]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.900]   at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:58.600]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.260]   And how do you help people who, you know, like that, they're having fun, they might
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:09.880]   be making some money, or losing lots of money, and help them understand why that might not
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:15.840]   be the best long-term strategy if their goal is to pursue this independence and be more
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.760]   confident getting there?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.960]   This might be a disappointing answer, but I found that for the large majority of these
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.120]   investors, you naturally end up on one side of the equation.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.540]   And once you're on that side of the equation, it's hard to convert you to the other side.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.560]   You know, that's not to say that's not true for everyone, but a lot of people, if you
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.320]   are a hardcore active investor, the odds that you will ever be persuaded to go on to the
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.120]   passive side, even if your returns are horrendous, are not that great.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.960]   I think for a lot of people, they're scratching, when they're actively investing, they're scratching
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.240]   a natural itch that they have, and that itch needs to be scratched.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.640]   And if they were passively investing, they would have this itch that would drive them
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.720]   crazy.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.200]   And therefore, that's, so they're always going to do it.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.080]   If there is a way that, I've seen a lot of financial advisors do this, is they say, "Okay,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.560]   I know you have this itch that needs to be scratched, you need to trade, you need to
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.000]   actively invest because that's part of your personality.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.080]   Can we put 70% of your net worth in a long-term diversified investing plan, and then you can
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.960]   trade with 10, 20, 30% so that you can, look, you have this core that's going to, this is
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.240]   kind of, you know, this is the big thrust that's going to get you into retirement, but
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   you can still trade.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.480]   We're not going to take that away from you."
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.320]   I think that's actually, like, if you're thinking about it rationally, that's the wrong thing
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.600]   to do, because either one strategy works or it doesn't, so why are you going to straddle
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   both?
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.640]   But for a lot of investors, I think that's the right thing to do, because it keeps them
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.640]   engaged.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.960]   And rather than just getting too bored with their investments, they're like, "Look, I
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.840]   still have this pocket where I can day trade and buy these stocks, and I feel great about
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   it."
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.640]   So, just giving them that outlet to scratch that itch, I think, is really important, and
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.600]   probably the best way to try to, if you were to convert people from one side to the next.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.640]   But the other thing I would say here that's really important is, I'm not a passive zealot.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.560]   I'm not one of the people who says, "Everyone should index, and no one can beat the market,
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.520]   and you shouldn't even try."
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.800]   Those investors exist, but I'm not one of them.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.920]   I've become much less judgmental as an investor over the last decade, when I just realized
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.320]   everyone has different goals, different skills, different needs, different desires.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.800]   They view the world through a different lens.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.080]   Like, I view the world through the life that I've lived, and only through that lens.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.160]   It's the only world that I know is what I've seen.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.360]   And the world that I've seen is different from the world that you've seen, and the world
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.460]   that you and I have seen is very different from different generations, people who live
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.460]   in different countries.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.540]   Like, everyone is different.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.200]   So to say that there's one right way to invest is something that I probably used to believe,
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.560]   but I've become much less judgmental as the years go on.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.800]   And you mentioned in the book a lot that people, even that might be similar, similar geography,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.880]   similar income, similar job, might be trying to play a different game.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.960]   They might be anticipating more money from inheritance.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.560]   They might be trying to earn some short-term money, or really focused on a different goal.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.900]   So it's interesting to hear how people compare themselves to people that might be in totally
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.900]   different circumstances.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.580]   I think about myself in college.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.800]   There was a social aspect of wearing nicer clothes and trying to put the peacock feathers
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   up again.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.760]   When I was in college, when I was looking for a girlfriend, when I was looking for a
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.880]   wife, when I was in that market, that was really important.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   Now that I'm happily married and my wife loves me till death do us part, it's a lot less
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   important for me.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:24.160]   But even myself, over the course of my relatively short life, the game has changed substantially
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.200]   in terms of who I want to be, who I want to show the world that I am.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.360]   That has changed substantially in my own life.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.720]   So if it changes within your own life in a 15-year period, then think about people who
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.020]   are different generations, people who live in different countries, different amounts
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.280]   of rich countries, poor countries.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.340]   Everyone thinks about these things totally different.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.360]   The other thing I would say is a couple of years ago, I was in Australia where they hadn't,
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.400]   at the time, they hadn't had a recession in 29 years.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.360]   29 years with no recessions.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   So virtually every adult had never seen a recession, ever.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   And then you compare that to the United States where 2001, 2008, we had these massive recessions
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.260]   that reshaped all of society.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.840]   And Australians, who of course, just as smart as us, have the same information as us, they're
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.000]   the same people, they had a completely different view on what risk is.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.840]   And at the time, Americans were very cognizant of like, the world can fall apart at any moment,
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.000]   you can lose everything, you can just poof.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.040]   And Australians didn't, just didn't have that view.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.720]   And it's not that we were right and they were wrong, that's not the right way to look at
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   it.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.680]   It's just, we're equally smart people, the same people that have very different views
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.400]   on the world just by the dumb luck of where we were born.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.680]   Yeah, do you think there's any way that people can start to, I don't know, force themselves
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.320]   to learn these lessons?
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.240]   I know, anytime you're looking to start investing, you get often asked or find things on the
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.400]   internet say, "Figure out whether you're comfortable with a 30% downturn."
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.680]   And it's easy if you invested all of your money and that downturn happened and you got
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.840]   to know, "Oh, here's what I did."
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.920]   But for many people, these things happen every 10 years or in Australia, every 30 years.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.360]   How can you start to understand your own tolerance for this before you see it?
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   Or can you?
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.040]   I don't, I think realistically, you probably can't until you've done it because there's
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   no formula.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.600]   It would be one thing if it was like, "Oh, you just need to know the formula, just go
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.240]   read the book and then it'll tell you what to do."
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.200]   But nobody knows who they are until they've been in the trenches.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.360]   No one understands their own unique personality.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:33.160]   And there are a lot of people who are a very calm personality, even like an even disposition,
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.040]   they don't panic very much in life, but they've never experienced losing half their money
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.160]   in the stock market.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.440]   And when they do, they realize that's the trigger that'll make them lose their minds.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.760]   So even if you are very introspective about who you are in general, I don't think people
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.320]   understand who they are financially until they've experienced some of these big declines.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.300]   And I've experienced 2008, I experienced March of 2020 last year, but there's a lot of things
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.800]   financially that I haven't experienced as well.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:05.440]   I have not, and you have not, lived through a period of sustained high inflation that
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.400]   hasn't existed since the mid, late 1970s.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.320]   So I can research that, I can try to be empathetic with people who lived through it, I can try
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.960]   to put myself in their shoes at the time, but until I've lived through it, I can't reasonably
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.280]   say that I know how I would respond to it.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.080]   And I think if we're being honest, that's true for a lot of people.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:30.440]   Like virtually no one in the developed world, at least, had any idea how they would respond
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.800]   to a viral pandemic until last February.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.320]   It just wasn't something that was necessarily on our mind.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.680]   And I think a lot of people responded in ways that they wouldn't have fathomed before.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.960]   You know, it was completely normal before last February.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   If you're on a plane and someone's coughing, 99% of people, not a big deal.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.680]   Someone's coughing, it's not a big deal.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.880]   Now going forward, if someone coughs on a plane, people are going to lose their minds.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.560]   They're going to have a totally different view that they never would have considered
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   before it happened.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.320]   I'll give you one very extreme example of this, and I have to preface this with like,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.520]   this is the most extreme example.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:12.120]   There's a book called What We Knew, and it's a book interviewing German civilians on what
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.160]   they knew during World War II, during when the Nazis were in power.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.560]   What did the civilians know?
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.560]   Not the guards at Auschwitz, the German civilians.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   What did they know?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.640]   What was going on?
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.180]   And there's this passage in the book where this German civilian said, "Look, when Hitler
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:29.000]   came to power in 1933, the Germans were fully behind them.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.120]   We were like, rah, rah, like Hitler, this is great."
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   And they said, "Why?
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   Like, I don't understand.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.520]   Can you explain why you were so excited about him?"
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.720]   And the civilian said, "Look, in the 1920s, Germany lost everything.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.240]   The economy fell apart.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   We lost everything.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   No one had a job.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   We lost all of our wealth.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.720]   And Hitler came along and said, 'I'll give you a job.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.720]   We're going to rebuild the country.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.040]   We're going to bring back German pride, et cetera, et cetera.'
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.360]   And in that situation where people were so desperate for anything, they looked at him
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.320]   and said, 'Great, that's my guy.'"
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.300]   And they're looking at this in hindsight and saying, "Look, when people are in a desperate
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:06.200]   situation where they don't have any money, they lost all their jobs, they lost everything,
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.520]   people will cling to things in that situation that they never would have imagined.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.440]   You'll cling to the craziest person that comes across if he's willing to give you a little
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   bit of hope."
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.280]   That's the most extreme example, but nobody knows what they're going to do or how they're
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.960]   going to react in the heat of the moment when things are really uncertain, when you've lost
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.240]   a lot of money, when you've lost your job.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.040]   When things are calm and prosperous, people don't know how they're going to respond during
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.540]   those heated moments until you've actually experienced it.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.280]   I think in the pandemic, I work at Wealthfront and we have a passively managed portfolio
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.520]   and we have risk tolerance questions and we ask, "How are you going to feel if the portfolio
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   is down?"
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.440]   And people overestimate what they think.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.480]   They say, "Well, if the market's down 20%, I'm going to buy more because it's on sale."
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.200]   But one of the interesting things that happened during the pandemic was some people made the
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.560]   complete different decision.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:04.760]   And not because they didn't think the market was on sale, because it wasn't a 20% down.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.240]   It was a 20% down in the middle of a pandemic where some people are shouting from television
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:15.040]   that the world could end and half the world could die and all of these extreme things.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.360]   And that feels very different than the academic exercise of "If something goes down 20%, what
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.480]   do you do?"
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:27.200]   And I personally think the media makes it even harder to know what to do because it's
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.280]   really extreme.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:34.880]   So that, to me, was a great example of the risk tolerance questionnaire isn't sufficient
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   in isolation.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.200]   You're absolutely right.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.440]   Because if you were to ask me, "Morgan, how would I feel if the market fell 30%?"
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:46.000]   If you were to ask that question, when I'm trying to picture that, I imagine a world
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   where everything is exactly the same today, except stock prices are 30% cheaper.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.320]   And in that world, it seems like an opportunity.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.280]   Everything is the same except cheaper stock prices.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.280]   That's a good opportunity.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.720]   But that's not how it works.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.440]   The reason the market falls 30% is because the banking system is about to collapse like
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.920]   2008, where there's a pandemic that might kill your entire family.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.600]   And in that context, totally different scenario.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.880]   And that's why people are just, in general, pretty poor at forecasting the risk tolerance
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.680]   and how they might behave during the next big decline.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.480]   You're getting major market declines just thinking of poor investment decisions, which
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   I think right now, there's this big rise of active trading.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:30.200]   And I'm sure you have opinions like I do about the gamification of investing and what that
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.080]   causes people to do.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.000]   But for people who are making decisions that end up being wrong, I think something I took
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.680]   away from the book and I've seen in practice is that you just will be wrong.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.080]   And I think something that I'd love you to talk a little bit about is how can people
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:50.040]   get comfortable with that concept, which is like, if you're a doctor, you don't want to
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.760]   be okay being wrong 20-30% of the time.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.000]   But as an investor, that's okay.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   And that's expected.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.160]   Obviously, if you're a pilot, then you have to be right 100% of the time.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.920]   You can't say, "I really botched this flight, but I got next time to come."
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.640]   But investing is not like that.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.120]   There's a thing that Benjamin Graham talked about in one of his books where he said, "Investors
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.640]   need to understand the difference between a positive and a negative art."
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.940]   And he said, "Investing in stocks was a positive art, because all you need to do to do well
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.040]   is make sure that you own the good ones."
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:26.560]   If you pick 100 stocks and 80 of them suck, but five of them are the next Apple, the next
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.960]   Amazon, the next Facebook, you're going to do incredible.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.640]   Even if 80% of the ones you picked go bankrupt.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.080]   So investing is a positive art.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:38.040]   He said, "Owning bonds is a negative art, because what you need to do to do well as
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.400]   a bond investor is make sure that you don't own any of the bad ones.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.800]   Any of the bonds that are going to default, you just need to avoid all of those."
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.560]   So it's important to realize, is what you're doing in life, and this applies to everything
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.300]   in life, like careers and friends, is it a positive or a negative art?
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.800]   Are you trying to find, is it just important that you find the one or two good ones?
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.260]   Or is it important that you really avoid the one or two bad ones?
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.400]   And investing in the stock market, again, is a positive art, which means that it is
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.840]   completely normal in every scenario, no matter how you're investing.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.560]   If you're an index fund investor, if you're a stock picker, if you're a trader, whatever
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:14.200]   it is, that you're going to make the majority of your lifetime returns from a small minority
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.000]   of the stocks that you pick.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Even in an index fund.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.260]   I mean, the stuff that's pretty incredible is that in a 40-year period from 1980 to 2020,
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:29.000]   the Russell 3000 Index, which is an index of large stocks in the United States, of 3,000
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.320]   companies in the United States, 40% of the components in the Russell 3000 effectively
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.280]   went out of business over this 40-year period, 40% of the components.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:43.200]   But the index itself had average annual returns of like 11% per year.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.440]   The index did really well, but 40% of the companies in the index went out of business.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.640]   And that's in an index fund.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.880]   That's not like a crazy stock picking strategy.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.040]   Even in an index fund, almost half of the companies that you invest in won't make it.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.040]   And that's fine.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   That's totally normal.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.480]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.200]   And the other example I use in the book is Benjamin Graham himself was a very successful
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.320]   fund manager over the course of his life, but 100%, and he writes about this, he was
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:15.440]   open about this, 100% of his career success is owed to one investment that he made, Geico.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.280]   If you take his career track record and remove Geico, his track record is completely average.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.880]   And Buffett has talked about this as well, too, from Berkshire Hathaway, if you take
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.620]   out the top five or 10 investments they've ever made, Berkshire's track record is average.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.600]   And so that's how successful investing works.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.480]   No matter what your strategy is, you don't need to be right all the time.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.600]   You just have to be right some of the time.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.280]   And I think a big part of this is if you invert that is that good investing is not about consistently
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.520]   making great decisions because nobody does.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.200]   It's about consistently not screwing up so much that you're kind of pushed out of the
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.600]   game.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.000]   It's consistently making sure that you don't make these catastrophic blunders that are
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   going to ruin everything.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.600]   But if you can stick around long enough and make enough bets or just have enough annual
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.520]   returns under your belt, you're probably going to do well over time, even if you're going
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.760]   to experience not just some, but a significant amount of underperformance and loss during
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   that period.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.920]   And one of the ways to think about this, there's a study from Morningstar a couple of years
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.120]   ago that looked at the best performing mutual funds of all time.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.820]   These are just cherry picking with hindsight what mutual funds had the best returns over
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.480]   like a 30 year period.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.680]   And the common denominator of the top three funds, I forget what the funds were, but the
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.600]   common denominator that they shared is that they spent almost 40% of the time of their
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.040]   life underperforming their benchmark.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.760]   So these are cherry picking with hindsight the best funds.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.320]   And if you actually own these funds, almost half the time you are underperforming your
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.640]   benchmark.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.240]   So it's not easy for people to wrap their heads around that, that tails drive everything,
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.320]   that it's just the kind of the tail ends of the bets that you make and the years that
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.400]   you're around that are going to drive everything.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.000]   But that's how markets work over time, whether it's for stock picking or just long-term index
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   investing.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.880]   Yeah, the two takeaways for me is if you're picking something that has the long-term nature
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.760]   of underperforming 40% of the time, you need to be long-term in the way you pick it and
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.960]   take a bet that can pay off over time.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.600]   And you talk about compounding and I think it's something that as much as it's been drilled
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.840]   in our heads our whole lives, it's something that you still need to kind of recognize.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.680]   And then the second is that you need to make multiple bets.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:27.000]   I hear this in Silicon Valley a lot when people say, "I want to start angel investing."
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.080]   And everyone says, "Okay, well, if you want to do that, you need to one, make enough bets
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.920]   that you might find something that succeeds and that hit rate is so low that you need
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.240]   to have enough money to make 20-30 bets.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.080]   But you also need to have so much money that angel investing isn't your whole portfolio
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.600]   because you might not get those lucky.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.600]   You might not."
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:50.280]   And so I think when you can take the approach of lots of things for a long time, that's
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.280]   great.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.200]   But taking the approach of, "I'm going to pick one stock and try to make money this
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.240]   year," I think it gets risky.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.040]   And I feel like we've kind of gamified that in recent past.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.040]   I feel like for all investing, what you're trying to do is just put the odds of success
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.880]   in your favor.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.240]   And the way that you're going to do that in a world where tails drive everything, the
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.560]   way to put the odds of success in your favor is to be taking a lot of bets and to be sticking
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.200]   around for a long period of time.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.800]   The more bets you have, the longer you're sticking around, the higher the odds that
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:22.240]   you're going to end up owning the great companies and you'll be around during the years that
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.280]   they achieve all of their returns.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   And you're going to spend a lot of time where those companies aren't performing, the market
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   isn't performing.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.920]   But if you stick around long enough and if you have enough bets, the odds fall firmly
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   in your favor.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.040]   One framework that a really good friend of mine gave me, because inevitably you're going
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.300]   to make a bad decision when it comes to your money.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.000]   He always asks me, he's like, "Hey, but wait, I know you're beating yourself up for making
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.400]   the wrong investment or doing the wrong thing.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.520]   But did you make the right decision with the information you had at the time?"
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:54.260]   And in one example, it was, "I want to make this thing a higher percentage of my portfolio.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.120]   And I chose a day to do that, where the next day it dropped significantly."
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.200]   And he goes, "Yeah, but at the time, was that part of your strategy?"
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.200]   I was like, "Yes."
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.720]   And he's like, "Well, you made the right decision and beat yourself up when you make bad decisions
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.320]   with information, but don't beat yourself up when you make the right decision, but it
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   goes wrong."
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.320]   Yeah, completely.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   And we only know one version of history, the version that happened.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.560]   And if we're just looking at a short period of time over the last 12 or 16 months, we
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.240]   know the version of history that happened, which was the government came out with trillions
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.880]   of dollars of stimulus packages.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:32.100]   We created incredible vaccines that were distributed very quickly and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.400]   That's the history that we know, but it could have been so much different.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.160]   It could have been that Washington had a bunch of partisan squabbles and there was no stimulus
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   package.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.440]   We didn't make vaccines.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:48.600]   You could easily imagine a world where economically and health wise, the world completely collapsed
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.920]   last year.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.720]   You could easily imagine that occurring.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.360]   And if that world occurred, then the people who sold their stocks last March would look
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.640]   like geniuses.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.840]   And that world easily could have occurred.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.320]   Just the fact that it didn't doesn't mean that we should ignore the fact that it easily
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.580]   could have.
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.320]   That's true for, I think, 2008 as well.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.280]   You can so easily imagine a world where after Lehman Brothers collapsed, Merrill Lynch,
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.840]   and then AIG, and then Citigroup, and then Bank of America all collapsed as well.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.080]   And in that world, which so easily could have happened, we probably would have been looking
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.960]   at the second version of the Great Depression.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.560]   That didn't happen, but it so easily could have.
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:29.440]   So I think just to your point, when people make a decision with the information that
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.800]   they have at their time, based off of the consequences of what might happen in these
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.000]   situations in the future, I think it's easy to beat yourself up, because all we have now
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.480]   is a version of history that happened.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.920]   But I think it's really important.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.200]   I think the smartest thinkers are totally comfortable looking at the histories that
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.760]   easily could have happened and how they prepared for them, even if in hindsight, it looks like
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.640]   it wasn't the best decision.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:58.080]   With the information that you had at the time, it may have actually been a great decision.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.120]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and trade coffee is a great addition
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.880]   to your new year routine.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.480]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.640]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.040]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.560]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their craft from
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.520]   the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.560]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.440]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.920]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.840]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:46.120]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.160]   and it's so delicious.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.360]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:59.160]   Right now, trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:09.040]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans, allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:13.880]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.280]   cooking at home?
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.600]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.880]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.120]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.680]   AnyDay, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.480]   AnyDay is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:40.840]   microwave and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.440]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.960]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.720]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:58.260]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your AnyDay adventure, I highly recommend
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.840]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.080]   It is so good.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.600]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year, you
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.320]   have to check it out.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.

[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.880]   I mean, you wrote in the book that the most important economic events of the future, things
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.800]   that move the needle the most, are things that history gives us no guide about.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   They're unprecedented.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   Like what we saw last year.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.120]   Knowing that, how do we use history as a guide for what to expect?
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.920]   We always have the disclosure, past performance does not reflect future gains.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.960]   But so much of investing is, well, the stock market generally goes up, so we should invest
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   in it.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:10.160]   Jason Zweig is a great writer from the Wall Street Journal, made this point one time that
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.440]   it's not that investors don't learn from history, it's that they learn too precise a lesson
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   from history.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.880]   So his example was after the dot-com bust, the lesson that people learned was when the
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.740]   P/E ratio exceeds 30, the market is too expensive.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.600]   That's a lesson that people took away.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:31.320]   But the actual lesson from the 1990s was overconfidence leads to trouble.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.120]   So people learn, they just learn a very precise lesson.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.560]   And since they learned a precise lesson, what they should have learned was overconfidence
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.060]   leads to trouble, but they didn't learn that lesson.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.480]   So they took their money and they went and started flipping condos in Miami or whatever
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.480]   it was.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.240]   So when you learn, when you look at history and you learn really precise lessons, they're
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.040]   not going to teach you much about the future.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.680]   Because like you said, the biggest events that's going to shape the rest of our lives
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.920]   are surprises that you and I or no one else can be talking about today.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:03.560]   So to me, the way to learn from history is looking back and taking the biggest, broadest
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:10.080]   30,000 foot level views and takeaways about human behavior, about how people respond around
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:15.820]   risk and greed and fear and overconfidence and surprises, like how do people behave around
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.820]   those events?
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.800]   Not the very specific granular takeaways.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:24.180]   I mean, like if you were to look at the last 12 or 16 months, you can have a lot of specific
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:29.120]   takeaways about supply chains and we should have had more N95 masks and the CDC should
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.780]   have had better preparedness, et cetera.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.680]   Those are like really specific takeaways.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.580]   And depending on what your job is, those might be good takeaways.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:40.800]   But for most people, the most important lesson in the last 16 months is there are things
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.680]   that can happen in the world that you're never thinking about that can completely upend all
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.560]   of your assumptions about the future.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.440]   Whenever you're surprised in a situation like we all have been in the last 16 months, the
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.320]   best takeaway is that the world is surprising.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:57.040]   It's not to look at what happened and saying, "How can we make sure this never happens again?"
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.360]   It's looking at the situation and saying, "A surprise is going to happen again."
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:07.300]   And I think once you do that, then financially, it pushes you much more towards having room
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.200]   for error in your finances.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.580]   If I knew all the risks in the future, I would be able to plan around that really effectively.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:18.900]   I would know that in 2023, there's going to be a recession that starts in February, so
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.900]   I'm going to have this cash set aside for that.
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.340]   But nobody knows that.
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.740]   And once you realize that we don't know what the future holds, it makes you much more comfortable
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.780]   being like, "I have this big chunk of cash sitting here and I don't know what it's for.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.100]   I don't know what I'm going to need it for.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.920]   I don't know what I'm going to use it for."
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.180]   But I'm confident that at some point in the future, the world is going to break in some
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.500]   way that I can't forecast or predict right now, but the world's going to break in some
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.900]   way and I'll be glad it's there.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.900]   Once you become just a little bit more open and flexible with that room for error in your
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.620]   finances, I think that's the only way that you can navigate a world where risk is what
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.620]   we don't see.
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:52.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:57.660]   You started this whole conversation off saying that the basics of finance, the models, the
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:01.540]   formulas are what we teach in school because it's way harder to teach all of this stuff.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.620]   And you just mentioned a lot of the history, you have to interpret it differently.
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:12.460]   Which makes me question, is there a path towards educating people more about this earlier?
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.940]   Should this stuff be in schools?
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.180]   Should this stuff be in colleges?
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:20.700]   How do we help people learn these lessons or at least start to understand these concepts
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:25.420]   that aren't just formulas earlier and more broadly so that people don't make as many
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.900]   mistakes and are better off?
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:32.500]   There's a German professor named Gerhard Gigerenzer who teaches the science of risk.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:37.820]   And he made this point that in school, we pretty much only teach the math of certainty.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:42.700]   We teach algebra and trigonometry, which are maths of certainty, gives you very precise
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:43.700]   answers.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.880]   And instead, what we should be teaching more of is the math of uncertainty, like probability
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.140]   and statistics.
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:54.060]   And that is taught in school, but it's secondary to the math of certainty, the math that teaches
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.220]   you precise answers, that's the first priority.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.460]   And then maybe in college, you can take a course on probability, but that's secondary.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.820]   He was saying that should be flipped.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:07.900]   We should be teaching kindergartners and second graders about probability, because that's
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.100]   the math that really matters in the world, and you're going to use it on a daily basis.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:16.140]   Algebra is important, but you're not going to use algebra on a daily basis, unless you
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.740]   have some job, you're a math professor or something.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:24.980]   99% of people will not use algebra on a daily basis, but 100% of people will use probability
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.980]   on a daily basis.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.980]   They might not know it.
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:32.580]   They're not actually doing the math, but probability impacts every hour of your life.
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.540]   And the decisions that you make in life rely on understanding how probability works.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.100]   And we rarely teach it.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.300]   It's a math of uncertainty.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.660]   This gets back to what I was saying earlier about what's taught in school is what's easy
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:48.860]   to teach, and certainty is easy to teach, because you come up with a formula that gives
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.980]   you the right answer.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:54.580]   Probability where it's like, there's all these unknown worlds, and by definition, it's like
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.360]   we don't necessarily know what's going to happen.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.980]   Those are harder to teach, they're harder to wrap your heads around, but they're what
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.700]   really matter in the world.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.980]   So if I were king for a day, so to speak, I think I would probably follow Gerard Geiger
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.180]   Ensor's advice and say, flip it around.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:11.380]   We should start with the math of uncertainty that really makes a difference in your life.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.580]   And as you get older and more specialized, then maybe we can talk about calculus and
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.100]   algebra.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:20.900]   And since neither of us are king for a day to make this change, are there ways that you
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:26.740]   think someone with kids that are in school right now could start to help them learn these
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.940]   lessons?
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:33.660]   I think if we're just talking about investing, if you start investing and you own a couple
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:38.580]   of stocks, you own a couple index funds, and you do it for a couple of years, you'll learn
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:41.900]   a lot about risk just through experience.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.980]   You're going to experience the market going way up, the market going way down, and that
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.580]   will teach you a lot just by learning.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:49.580]   You're in the trenches getting your hands dirty.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:53.580]   I think that's the best way, I would say, to teach people about risk and uncertainty
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.580]   is just being thrown in.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.420]   Now, a lot of investors who started investing in the last year, all they've experienced
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.380]   is the market going not just up, but way up.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.740]   That's what they know.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:07.740]   So the last year of experience has not been a very good lesson because you're not really
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.300]   getting the full side of risk.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.940]   You've only learned half the equation.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.260]   You really got to be investing for a couple years through a couple of cycles before you're
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.260]   like, "Okay, I get it."
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.540]   And then you start viewing the bull markets as like, "Hey, this is cool, but this isn't
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.220]   going to last, and a lot of this is going to unwind, and it's going to hurt a lot when
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:26.940]   it does, but I'm okay with that because I've lived through this before."
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.620]   I think that's really the only way to do it is with your own money, your own skin in the
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.420]   game, getting your hands dirty.
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.420]   And I totally agree here.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.900]   I wouldn't advocate for what I'll propose to be any significant portion of your money.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:46.980]   But a conversation I had with a friend, an investor, last week was about cryptocurrency.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   And he pointed out that one of the most fascinating lessons about cryptocurrency that he's seen
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.860]   is that there's such extreme volatility, right?
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:02.440]   You could go up and down 50% almost in a day, that it's taught him more about market crashes
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.140]   and bull markets in the shortest amount of time possible.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.500]   And it made me think, "Gosh, I don't think people should put all of their money in cryptocurrency
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.860]   by any stretch of the means."
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.540]   And that's not the advice.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:17.480]   But if you want to learn through investing, it could be a way to accelerate your learning
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.300]   because it has just such extreme volatility.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.780]   I totally buy that.
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:22.780]   A hundred percent.
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:27.000]   I mean, I'm in the same boat as you in terms of recommending crypto, but I absolutely buy
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   that argument.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   100%.
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.260]   Well, before we wrap, we've talked a lot about money and risk.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:38.520]   Are there any main takeaways that you think people should leave this conversation with?
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.200]   To me, the biggest thing that I think is the most important part of behavioral finance
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.800]   and is maybe the one of the most overlooked is that in order to do well, you have to become
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:50.680]   introspective about who you are and realize that you are different from me and we're all
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   different.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.880]   And the only way that you can really understand and master the behavioral side of finance
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:58.140]   is just really taking a look at who you are personally.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:01.840]   Not reading about other people or other people's situations, but just being honest with yourself
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.720]   about your own skills, your own weaknesses, your own risk tolerance, your own goals in
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.920]   life.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.220]   And that's different for everyone.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.800]   And that's why a lot of people don't...
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.640]   Most people want one answer, like what's the right thing to do?
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.440]   And when you become introspective about who you are and realize that everyone's different,
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.960]   you realize that people come to different conclusions.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.780]   And what's the right decision for you, Chris, might be the wrong decision for me.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:28.400]   Even if we're roughly the same age, people come to different things.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   So I would just implore people to spend a little bit more time looking at themselves
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.360]   in the mirror and try to figure out who they are and what their risks and goals are.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   That makes total sense.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:40.080]   And I'd like to end all these conversations.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.480]   This is a show called All The Hacks.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.760]   And today, I would say it's a little different than some where it wasn't kind of running
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:50.680]   through very tactical things you can do, but really reframing psychology and money as something
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.000]   that if you can really start to understand how things work, you can probably hack your
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   mind to start to be a more rational, or at least a more reasonable, as you say, investor
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.940]   and more reasonable with money.
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:07.320]   But I will ask, are there a few kind of like life hacks or in any genre for you that are
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:12.040]   things that you do that people have often commented are fascinating or interesting that
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.040]   you'd want to share?
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.820]   I'll leave you with one financial hack that might disappoint you, but it's the only hack
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.680]   that works and it works incredibly well in finance.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:22.440]   You want to do well with finance?
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.600]   Spend less money than you make and be patient.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.280]   That's 90% of what finance is.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.480]   If you can actually do those, you have a black belt in finance.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.080]   It's the only hack that I think really truly works in a way that moves the needle.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.080]   I don't disagree.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.760]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.440]   Where can people find out more about what you're writing and everything you do?
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.240]   My book is The Psychology of Money.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.640]   And I spend most of my time on Twitter.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.880]   My handle is Morgan Housel, first and last name.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.700]   That's where most of my stuff is posted.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.700]   Cool.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.900]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   This was great.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.900]   This is fun.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.900]   Thanks very much.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:53.900]   Wow.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.300]   I really loved this episode.

[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.940]   I know this episode didn't have as many quick hacks as some others, but like Morgan said,
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:11.260]   if you can master some of the bigger mindset changes, you can really position yourself
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.260]   well with money.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:18.280]   If you have any thoughts or feedback, please get in touch by email, chris@allthehacks.com

[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:57.760]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.580]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:05.900]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.260]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.780]   to save a dollar.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:15.740]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:20.940]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.100]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened to
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:31.460]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind, and it was so crazy
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:36.420]   to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.420]   plan.
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.840]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.580]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.260]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.100]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.220]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.660]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.580]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
