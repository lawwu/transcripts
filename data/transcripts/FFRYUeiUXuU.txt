[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.260]   What comes out of that kind of insanity that we're seeing now where you're not even dealing with reality?
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.400]   We're making laws to make the insane feel normal.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.020]   What comes out of that? All kinds of things that are not proper.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.520]   All unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil,
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.940]   disobedient to parents without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.900]   That's what you get in that culture of insanity.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.020]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:39.520]   I determine to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:01:06.260]   We are all well aware of how even the smallest amount of light can overpower utter darkness.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.460]   Darkness is powerless against light.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.020]   So it should come as no surprise that this illustration is one of the ways Christ described Himself when He said,
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.340]   I am the light of the world. He who follows Me will not walk in darkness.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.820]   Today, we start a two-part study further exploring the relationship between light and darkness.
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.200]   Grab your Bible as Pastor John takes us back into the 17th chapter of Luke.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:48.040]   I have a lot to say, and I want to say things that will be definitive and helpful to you,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:58.040]   because it's very apparent to us now that we who are in the invisible kingdom are living in the middle of another kingdom.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   When Jesus prayed to the Father, He didn't say, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.520]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.720]   He said, "Take them out of the world."

[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.520]   He said, "Take them out of the world."

[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.320]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.520]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.720]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.920]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.120]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.320]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.520]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.720]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.920]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.080]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.880]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.280]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.480]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.680]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.880]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.880]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.080]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   He said, "Take them out of the world."

[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.840]   He said, "Take them out of the world."

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.000]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.200]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.400]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.600]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.800]   He said, "Take them out of the world."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   That form of social, national, cultural apostasy leads to God giving them up, turning them over.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.200]   And what does that look like?
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.000]   The first phase in verse 24, "God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.400]   For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.200]   rather than the Creator who is blessed forever.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.600]   Amen."
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.800]   So the first thing you would see in a culture
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:56.000]   under judgment is a sexual revolution, immorality, impurity, lust unbounded, dishonoring their
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.400]   bodies among them, pornography as a norm.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.600]   The second is in verse 26, "God then gave them over to degrading passions for their
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.800]   women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural."
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.600]   That's lesbianism.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.600]   And in the same way, "Also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.800]   in their own person the due penalty of their error."
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.000]   And that might be AIDS.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.400]   So first you'll have a sexual revolution when God's wrath is unleashed on a society that
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.800]   turns against Him.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.000]   Secondly, you'll have a homosexual revolution.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Sound familiar?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.400]   Verse 28 says there's a third step.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   "Just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.600]   mind."
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.800]   That's a mind that doesn't function.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   There's a kind of insanity.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   What does that refer to?
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.000]   Not accepting reality.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I read yesterday that this one author wants people to know there are a hundred genders.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   That's insanity.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.600]   And what comes out of that kind of insanity that we're seeing now where you're not even
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.000]   dealing with reality?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.200]   We're making laws to make the insane feel normal.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   What comes out of that?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.600]   All kinds of things that are not proper, all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:49.600]   envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip, slander, haters of God, insolent, arrogant,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.000]   boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents without understanding, untrustworthy,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.400]   unloving, unmerciful.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.200]   Okay, that's what you get in that culture of insanity.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   Verse 32 says, "The insanity is so severe that though they know the ordinance of God,"
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.400]   how do they know it?
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.200]   "They have built into the fabric of their humanity."
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.600]   The law of God is written in the heart.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   And in our case, they've had the Bible.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.000]   And even though they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.800]   worthy of death, they not only do the same, but give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:37.200]   They make them legal.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   Why are we where we are?
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:49.000]   Because we're under this wrath.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.200]   This is not just us.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.400]   Acts 14 says, "God has allowed all the nations to go their own way."
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.200]   This is the cycle of human history.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.800]   We're now in an evil kingdom.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.200]   The kingdom we're in is so evil that God's wrath has been unleashed.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.000]   We've been living in it
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   for a number of decades now, from the sexual revolution through the homosexual revolution
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:21.000]   to the reprobate mind where you can't even think straight, and reality and fantasy are mingled.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.200]   The evil kingdom holds its power by one thing: lies.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   And that's what Paul said.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:39.000]   They exchanged, verse 25, the truth of God for a lie.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.000]   The evil kingdom gains its power by lies.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It holds its power by lies, by suppressing the truth.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   What the evil kingdom fears most is truth, truth.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   The kingdom of darkness, the evil kingdom, has a ruler.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Turn to John 8.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.800]   It's getting foundational here.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.200]   John 8.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   Jesus said to religious Jews who had rejected God, John 8:44, "You are of your father the
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.000]   devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.800]   He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.600]   truth in him.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   Whenever he speaks the lie, he speaks the truth.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.600]   He speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.200]   But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me."
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   Verse 47, "He who is of God hears the words of God.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:58.000]   For this reason you do not hear them, because you're not of God."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.400]   If you're in the evil kingdom, the kingdom of darkness, Satan, the archetypal liar, propagates lies through that kingdom,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.600]   and that's really all you can believe.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.400]   Because you have no capacity to believe the truth.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   So what threatens the kingdom of lies is truth.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.600]   The liar's history is pretty well known.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:27.200]   God created Adam and Eve, put them in the garden, gave them a command.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.800]   Satan showed up, the liar, and told Eve, "God lied.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.200]   You're not going to die.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   God lied to you."
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.200]   She believed the liar, and the whole human race fell.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   Now, the apostle John says, "The whole world lies in the lap of the evil one."
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   The lap of the evil one is a lap of lies.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   By the way, it's an interesting note when you come to the end of the book of Revelation,
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   Revelation chapter 22:15, and we're in eternal heaven.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.000]   It says, "The liars are outside."
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.000]   The liars are outside.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   For the first time in redemptive history and forever, heaven will have only the truth.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   The kingdom of darkness is a kingdom of lies.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Even humanity recognizes the importance of truth.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.800]   Plato said, "No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth."
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   George Orwell said, "The further a society drifts from the truth,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.800]   the more it will hate those who speak it."
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   A line that came out of the Nazi German era, "Those who burn books will soon burn people,
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   because they have to stop the truth."
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.600]   The truth is the only power against the lies.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.000]   This is not new to us.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.600]   This is essentially the indictment of Isaiah against Israel
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.600]   in chapter 5.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   It says among the indictments, chapter 5 of Isaiah, verse 20,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness,
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter."
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   That's what happens.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   The evil kingdom switches everything.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   Everything is inside out and upside down.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.400]   Now, I'm going to give you an axiom that you need to remember.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:44.000]   A society is defined by what it will not tolerate.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Did you get that?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.200]   A society is defined by what it will not tolerate.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:01.400]   When God wanted us to know His will, He didn't say, "Let me give you ten suggestions
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.900]   of what would be good behaviors."
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.200]   He gave us ten commandments.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.000]   He gave us ten laws.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.200]   Because life is always going to be defined by what you tolerate.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.600]   In the past, even in our country, there was a traditional Judeo-Christian,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.800]   biblical, conventional morality.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:32.600]   And there were laws against certain kinds of behaviors.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.000]   And when you violated those traditional laws drawn from Scripture,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.000]   there was shame.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.400]   That was the old culture where biblical morality still had sway,
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:54.800]   and shame was connected to the things that the Bible assigns shame.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:03.000]   And that culture and the cultures that followed, adultery was scorned,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.800]   fornication was looked down on, homosexuality was scorned,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.800]   and the idea of being a man was hardly talked about.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   Lesbianism was rare because women have a natural instinct to bear children with a husband.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   Transgender, beyond imagination.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:36.600]   These kinds of things were virtually unacceptable and unimaginable.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   And so, the law of God was a standard for everyone.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   And so, the transcendent sacred authority whose law was a standard for everyone
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.400]   gave rise to what Carl Truman calls the modern self,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.000]   where sovereignty goes from an external sacred standard of God to the individual.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.800]   And now we have self-styled sovereignty.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.400]   Everybody's a sovereign over his own life and can declare himself
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.400]   to be anything he wants to be.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.800]   God was rejected, the Bible's rejected, and with it, biblical morality.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.600]   Everything goes to individualism.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.400]   As a result, what our society will not tolerate is exactly the opposite
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.400]   of what it would not tolerate in the past.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:36.200]   So we are now in an overturned morality.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:49.200]   This society is making laws to normalize, justify sins, blatant sins.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:19:06.000]   Since the new king has come to power, I'm sure no previous ruler
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:16.000]   has been so consumed with LGBTQ transgender perversion.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.500]   When you have the swearing in of the new secretary of state, and in being sworn in,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.600]   he vows to put a gay pride flag on every U.S. embassy on the planet.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:35.800]   There's some kind of perversion that has literally turned our culture upside down.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.400]   If you disagree with this, you're a domestic terrorist.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.000]   You're an extremist.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Now, if you disagree with this, you're a danger.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.200]   You're breaking the law.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.800]   You're homophobic, transphobic.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.000]   You need to be silenced.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You need to be terminated.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.300]   You need to be marginalized.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.600]   Maybe you need to be silenced
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   altogether or removed.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   Laws are being made to criminalize righteousness.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:26.000]   Laws are being made to silence, terminate truth speakers.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.200]   Half of the states in America have such laws.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.400]   An Air Force chaplain was removed
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:43.400]   from his duty because he gave a message against sexual immorality.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.800]   He was dismissed.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.200]   You either bake the cake or go to jail.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.600]   The new king can't stop making rules, can he?
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.400]   You say, "Why are you calling this a monarchy?"
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   Because of executive orders that are just endless.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.200]   That's unilateral rule.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.200]   The king and the kingdom of lies will not tolerate the truth.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   To speak the truth is the greatest threat.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   They define it as hate speech, personal animus, and now, as I said,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   domestic terrorism.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   And to sort of create theater about that, they put fences around the Capitol
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   building and 30,000 troops as if we are such a frightening enemy.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   They need to arm
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.000]   Washington to defend themselves.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   There can be no civil liberties for those who tell the truth.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   There can be no freedom of speech for those who tell the truth
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.200]   because they invade safe spaces.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   They trigger people.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   So the king and his lying agents must demonize the truth tellers.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.800]   And then they need to demonize the past.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.800]   They need to kill history.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   They need to go back so past moral standards don't crawl up out of the grave and offend somebody.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   Strong societies have their foundation in sacred truth.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   They have a transcendent standard.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   When that is removed, what you have is barbarism, according to one writer.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.600]   Barbarism means paganism.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.600]   Lack of civilization.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.600]   So the trend here is exactly what Romans 1 said.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   It's ungodliness and unrighteousness, godless paganism, hating God, hating Christ, hating the Scripture,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   hating the true church, and fearing the truth.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.400]   Satan is the liar king.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   He's the liar king.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.400]   He has a massive supernatural force of demons against whom we wrestle.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   His children are liars.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   The kingdom of darkness is known by its lies.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   This has penetrated the most sacred halls of our government, the Supreme Court.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   In 2013, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.200]   to make way for homosexual behavior and marriage, and actually declared,
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:44.200]   in their filing, that religious objections to homosexuality come from hate.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   God is out. Prayer is out.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.200]   The Ten Commandments are out. Get those off the wall.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.200]   The Bible is out. Blasphemy is in.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.200]   Immorality is to be protected.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   In fact, laws are to be made and enforced
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   to normalize
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.000]   perversion.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Cancel all dissent.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   There can't be any dissent.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   That's why people are getting canceled.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   That's why their Twitter accounts are being taken down.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And big tech is in cahoots with this paganism.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And for the first time in human history, they can shut down anybody they want.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.800]   This leads me to draw your attention to
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.800]   2 Corinthians 10.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   Your watch is irrelevant this morning. Stop looking at it.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   I know what you're doing in those pauses.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   2 Corinthians 10:3.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.600]   "Though we walk in the flesh" - and it doesn't mean sin, but humanity - "though we're human, we do not war,
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   according to the flesh."
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:11.600]   We can't fight this spiritual battle with any human strategies.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   The weapons of our warfare are not human, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:33.400]   We've got to realize that we're assaulting fortresses - that's the word for palaces, forts, prisons,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.400]   and tombs.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   We're assaulting massive stone edifices.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   We have to destroy them.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   And we don't expect to do that with human ingenuity and human strategy.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   "What are these fortresses?" he says in the next verse.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200]   We're destroying logismos - ideas, ideologies, philosophies, speculation.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:14.200]   We are destroying lies because they are defined further as every anti-God idea, every lofty
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   thing raised up against the knowledge of God.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   We as a church in the world have the responsibility to assault the fortresses of lies.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   That's why we're here.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.000]   To smash down every idea raised up against the knowledge of God.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.000]   And then on the positive, take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   That's magnificent language, isn't it?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   We turn people from lies to the truth.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   That's why we're here.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   So do you understand what a threat we are?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   We exist in the world for one purpose, and that is to expose the lies and to bring the truth.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.800]   And when lies dominate the kingdom at every point,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.800]   and when they are basically the foundation of the society's laws,
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   we are not tolerable.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   But we are the kingdom, and the kingdom is here because the King is here.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   God is our King.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   Psalm 47:7, "God is the King of all the earth."
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.600]   Psalm 74:12, "God is my King."
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:39.600]   Psalm 10:16, "The Lord is King forever and ever."
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   Jeremiah 10:10, "But the Lord is the true God. He is the living God."
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   Isaiah 33:22 says, "The Lord is our judge. The Lord is our lawgiver.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   The Lord is our King. He will save us."
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.600]   Next week on Grace To You.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.400]   Right now, the kingdom of the world is not His.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   Right?
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   It's ruled by wicked kings.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   It's under the rule of Satan.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   But the day is coming when the kingdom of the world,
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.600]   not just the invisible kingdom, but the visible kingdom, the world,
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ,
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   and He will reign forever and ever.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   We'll see you next week.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   God bless you.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.800]   God bless you.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.000]   God bless you.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.200]   God bless you.
