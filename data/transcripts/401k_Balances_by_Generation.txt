[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam Ansinni
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.420]   from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.060]   And in this episode, we want to talk about why
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.060]   the 401k balances by generation,
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.260]   from Gen Z to boomers, are so low.
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.200]   So, Fidelity recently came out with its average
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.280]   and median 401k balances by generation.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.920]   And they are as follows.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.420]   Gen Z, the youngest generation,
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.580]   the average 401k balance is 7,100,
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.680]   and the median is 2,500.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.920]   I don't fault those numbers at all.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.640]   Seems pretty normal.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.240]   But the millennials, the millennials generation,
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.280]   many of which are now 40 and over, early 40s,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.040]   late 30s for sure, early 40s,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.480]   the average 401k balance is 44,900,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.080]   and the median 401k balance is 15,500.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.760]   Now we move on to Gen X,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.940]   which I am technically a Gen Xer, born in 1977.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.800]   The average, 145,500,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.740]   but the median is only 44,000.
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.080]   And then finally, we have the boomers,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.880]   with an average of 215,000,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.740]   and a median of 61,200.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.100]   So, these numbers, millennials, Gen X, boomers,
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.100]   and if we look at the median numbers,
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.860]   this is a problem, folks,
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.720]   because how on earth are you gonna be able to retire
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.300]   with a 401k balance of only $44,000?
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.960]   And then for boomers, 61,200,
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.040]   I mean, how are you gonna live off that?
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.560]   Were these numbers shocking to you, Cindy,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.680]   when you saw them?
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.600]   - Yeah, they were way lower than I expected,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.580]   so I was pretty shocked too.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.740]   - And this is the thing, though.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.560]   You don't hear a retirement crisis in America
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.980]   where our elders are getting thrown out of their houses
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.540]   or starving on the streets.
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.900]   I mean, I don't see any kind of articles like that.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.020]   Do you, Cindy?
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.400]   - No, nothing comes to mind.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.460]   - Well, there must be a reason
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.160]   why there's no retirement crisis,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.000]   given how low the average and median balances are.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.220]   Really, we need to look at the median numbers
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.240]   instead of the averages,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.640]   because several rich folks bring up the averages.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.140]   So, we look at the medians and we say,
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.180]   well, things seem to be okay.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.260]   And one of the reasons why is because our older generation,
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.140]   a greater percentage of them have pensions.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.500]   Right now, something like only 16%
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.860]   of American working population has a pension.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.460]   So, if you have a pension, consider yourself very lucky.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.740]   It's like winning the lottery,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.100]   because the value of a pension,
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.760]   if it's a lifetime pension,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.260]   could be worth in the millions and millions of dollars.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.900]   And I wrote a very detailed post
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.460]   about how to calculate the value of your pension,
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.060]   which you should check out in the show notes.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.940]   Now, what other reasons could there be
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.540]   for why there's no retirement crisis
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.980]   with the median balances so low?
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.900]   What do you think, Cindy?
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.900]   - Well, one thing that you talked about in your post
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.420]   that is true for me is people change jobs,
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.180]   and typically when that happens,
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.020]   they roll over their 401(k) into a rollover IRA.
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.260]   And that's exactly what I did.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.140]   So, I don't have a 401(k) anymore.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.460]   I have a rollover IRA.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.380]   So, Fidelity is just focusing on the accounts that they hold
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.540]   that are 401(k).
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.620]   So, there's other types of retirement accounts
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.740]   that people hold.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.340]   - Right, and there's other 401(k) providers
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.020]   like Vanguard and Principal and many, many other ones.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.380]   So, if you just look at the Fidelity numbers,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.160]   it's like, okay, they're not that large,
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.300]   but Fidelity doesn't account for the entire 401(k) market.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.580]   And me too.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.480]   When I left my job in 2012, I rolled it over into an IRA.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.580]   And the reason why I did so was because,
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.340]   one, I didn't have another job,
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.980]   so therefore I couldn't roll it over to another 401(k) plan
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.340]   because there was no other 401(k) plan.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.940]   And just as a side note,
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.460]   I wrote a new post on the 60-day rollover rule,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.540]   and the rule states that you have 60 days
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.700]   to roll over your 401(k) or IRA to another plan,
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.800]   and during those 60 days,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.940]   you could actually withdraw some money
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.580]   and use it to do whatever you want,
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.100]   penalty-free, tax-free,
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.420]   so long as you put that money back within 60 days.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.180]   It's a little bit complicated.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.020]   It's not as easy as I just said,
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.380]   so take a look at that post,
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.980]   but if you need funds
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.820]   and you wanna tap your tax-advantaged accounts,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.520]   there's the 60-day rollover rule.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.620]   So, I decided to roll it over to an IRA
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.760]   because there was more flexibility.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.020]   I didn't have to invest in the funds
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.580]   that were offered in my 401(k),
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.060]   so I was not a prisoner.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.140]   I had maximum flexibility to invest in whatever I wanted,
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.140]   ETFs, low-cost index funds, single stocks.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.500]   I had carte blanche flexibility,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.900]   including fixed income as well.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.500]   And so, overall, that has turned out pretty well
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.380]   because I invested for the long-term
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.700]   and I didn't trade my IRA,
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.920]   and that is something that people need to be aware of.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.780]   When you roll it over to an IRA,
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.860]   you could have the temptation
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.220]   to start trading your portfolio,
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.340]   and that is almost always a bad move
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.460]   for returns long-term.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.580]   So, guess what, folks?
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.180]   My 401(k) balance is actually quite small.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.980]   I looked on my Fidelity account,
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.620]   and I have a solo 401(k),
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.260]   and it's about $267,000,
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.780]   and that's pretty small for my standards
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.380]   for what I think people should have in their 401(k)s
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.460]   if they continuously max them out at the age of 46,
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.240]   which I'm at right now.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.240]   Now, $266,000 compared to the median
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.140]   for my generation of 44,000 for Gen X is quite high.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.940]   But man, if I only had $266,000 right now
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.940]   and that's all I had for my retirement,
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.240]   I would probably be panicking right now.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.460]   Well, what I would probably be doing
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.340]   would be working right now.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.000]   I wouldn't be not working.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.260]   I would get a job and try to beef that up.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.840]   But because I also have the rollover IRA
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.340]   and I have a SEP IRA and I have a solo 401(k),
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.420]   combined, these tax advantage counts is over a million.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.660]   So, Sydney, what type of tax-advantaged
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.700]   retirement accounts do you have,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.420]   and how much are you counting on them
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.580]   for traditional retirement?
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.760]   - So, I actually don't have any 401(k)s anymore.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.060]   I have a rollover IRA,
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.840]   I have a SEP IRA,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.880]   and I have a Roth IRA.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.560]   So, I have three different types of retirement accounts.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.800]   And I am not counting on Social Security for my retirement,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.480]   although I'm gonna treat it as a bonus if I do get it.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.920]   Altogether, I don't have a million,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.640]   but I'm pretty close to that.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   So, I'm also investing in my after-tax investment account
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.320]   as a supplement to my retirement accounts.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.160]   - Right.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.940]   For those who wanna achieve financial freedom
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.680]   sooner, fire, in other words,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.340]   you really need to beef up your taxable portfolio,
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.080]   your after-tax investment accounts,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.520]   your rental property portfolio,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.440]   because these investments, these portfolios,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.320]   are what's gonna spit out that tappable passive income
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.400]   that you can use to live your life until 59 1/2,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.760]   when you can touch your 401(k) and IRA money penalty-free,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.120]   and also until 62 1/2 plus
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.800]   when you are eligible to withdraw from Social Security.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.760]   I think the maximum Social Security benefit amount
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.340]   an individual can take is over $4,000 now.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.700]   So, if we keep on going the way we're going,
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.140]   we're gonna be able to get to the max,
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.140]   because the FICA tax limit is something like 122,600,
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.320]   where the FICA tax and Social Security and Medicaid tax,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.480]   it taxes income up to that level.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.040]   So, we've been able to make that for a long time now.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.440]   So, in retrospect,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.300]   if we do get Social Security payments in 15 years,
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.620]   it should be pretty good, because inflation adjusted,
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.720]   it's gonna be well over $4,000 a month.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.080]   Do you think you can live off 4,000 plus a month?
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.060]   - I think so.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.920]   I don't plan to change my lifestyle habits
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.080]   dramatically in any way.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.120]   I think readers know that we are frugal
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.160]   in the way that we live our lifestyle.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.560]   So, I think it's doable.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.280]   - Yeah, oh, so let me clarify, folks.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.320]   The 2023 FICA tax rates and limits,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   it's not 122,000 or whatever I said.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   It's actually 160,200 of your earnings
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.040]   are subject to the Social Security tax,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.480]   and that's up from 147,000 in 2022.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.440]   And then there's an additional 0.9% surtax
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.760]   on top of the standard 1.45% Medicare tax
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.600]   for those who earn over 200,000 for single filers,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.040]   or 250,000 for joint filers.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.400]   So, that is, whoa, that's a lot.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.880]   It's interesting how I haven't been in the workforce
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.840]   for so long that I didn't realize,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.640]   whoa, I guess inflation adjustment,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.360]   the FICA tax has gone up that high.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.960]   Did you realize that was 160,200 per person?
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.800]   - No, I wouldn't know exactly off the top of my head.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.360]   122 or 23 or whatever you said did sound a little bit low,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.200]   but I didn't know it was as high as 162.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.520]   - No, it's 160,200.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.120]   - Oh, sorry, yeah, that's high.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.920]   - That is high.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.360]   And so, you know what?
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.040]   Every dollar you make above 160,200
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.320]   isn't subjected to the FICA tax,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   which specifically is 6.2% Social Security tax,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   aka OASDI, and then a 1.45% Medicare tax.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.400]   Now, if you're self-employed,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.800]   aha, you've gotta pay both sides.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   So, we're talking double 7.65%, and that is a lot.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.720]   And this is one of the reasons why people
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.240]   who are self-employed often incorporate as an S-corp,
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.800]   where they pay themselves a lower salary,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.600]   which faces the FICA tax,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.360]   and then they pay the rest of their profits
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.680]   in terms of distributions, which don't pay the FICA tax.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.120]   And this is a little bit complicated in the weeds,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.020]   and I also have a post on this,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.880]   but you don't wanna have your distributions
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   really be much greater than 50% of your total compensation.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.300]   And another reason why the median
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.320]   or the average 401(k) balance is so low
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.080]   is because I think life just gets in the way.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.960]   Many readers have told me about their situations,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   and I'd like to share it with them.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.840]   So, here's Joe.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.180]   He's 42 years old, and he makes $120,000 a year
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.280]   as an engineer.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.440]   He's been working for 19 years,
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.480]   and he has 80,000 in his 401(k), right?
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.200]   He said he never considered maxing out his 401(k)
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.720]   because he always thought he wouldn't have enough money left
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.520]   to take care of his wife and his son.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.320]   His wife worked for the first eight years
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.160]   and decided to stay at home after giving birth.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.560]   Going from a two-income family
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.200]   to a one-income family is difficult
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.560]   if you're not used to saving half.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.780]   Case study number two, Sally's 32 years old
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.420]   and makes $75,000 a year plus bonus
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.520]   as a medical equipment sales rep.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.400]   She got her master's degree in health
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.600]   and graduated with $27,000 in debt.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.760]   So, she pays $500 a month in student loans now
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.800]   starting October 2023.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.640]   After seven and a half years of working at a reputable firm,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.800]   Sally's 401(k) retirement balance is $70,000
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.000]   compared to a recommended $127,000
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.520]   after eight years of work experience.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.960]   And she basically said, look, education is expensive,
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.840]   and she had debt, and she lived in a high-cost living area,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.360]   so she could only save what she could.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.040]   Another case study, Susie, 34 years old,
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.400]   single, makes $150,000 plus bonus
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.480]   as an investment banker in San Francisco,
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.520]   and she decided to take a break.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.620]   She was burned out and wanted to try something new,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.360]   and she wanted to do bakery.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.640]   So, she tried to be a baker for two years,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.360]   and it only paid something like $18 an hour
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.560]   while she was standing in front of a hot stove
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.360]   and a hot oven for eight hours a day,
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.700]   and she said, screw that.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.700]   But that two-year hiatus cost her a lot of contributions.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.280]   And here's another case study by a highly educated couple.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.200]   Many, quote, above-average people
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.600]   do not start working at age 22
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.820]   and incur substantial debt before they start working.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.780]   For example, I am a lawyer that obtained a master's degree
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.600]   and then a law degree before starting my career at age 28.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.180]   My wife is a doctor who completed her residency
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.060]   and started practicing at age 28 as well.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.300]   Both of us started our careers
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.260]   with substantial student loan burdens,
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.080]   over $325,000 between us.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.420]   Our late start means we lose a lot of magic
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.780]   of compounding interest,
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.820]   and our debt burden takes a big chunk
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.440]   of our monthly income.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.980]   These are significant challenges.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.020]   Here's another case study.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.860]   What is misleading as to why many people's 401ks
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.500]   are half or less than what they should be is one word.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.780]   Divorce.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.820]   I am currently 44 years old.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.100]   When I was 37 in 2008, I had $125,000 in my 401k,
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.700]   and then boom, stock market crashed,
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.120]   and my 401k was worth $80,000.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.860]   Yeah, not fun.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.100]   Seven years later, my portfolio recovered to $130,000,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.460]   but then I had to go through a divorce.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.540]   Now I'm back to $65,000.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.860]   Ridiculous.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.980]   Over 50% of marriage goes into divorce,
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.420]   and many men are paying child support and alimony,
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.360]   and aside from losing half our retirement,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.060]   we now have nothing for years to invest, but I digress.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.940]   Hmm, I'm sorry to hear about that.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.860]   So you see, life does get in the way,
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.820]   whether you're changing jobs, getting a divorce,
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.500]   going through a bear market, paying off student loan debt,
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.700]   trying to help a loved one with their finances.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.660]   Life gets in the way, which is why there's that old saying,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.060]   pay yourself first before life gets in the way.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.740]   So try to max out your 401k as much as possible.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.940]   Do it until it hurts, because it's not
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.100]   going to hurt for that long, because you will adjust
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.540]   to your lower cash flow.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.700]   Just think about it as, oh, like a tax cut.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.820]   It's like a tax cut as well as a pay cut for your future self.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.100]   So we've heard about the various median 401k balances
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.700]   by generation, and this really dovetails well
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.380]   with a previous study from Northwestern Mutual Online,
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.580]   which talked about, for all ages,
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.260]   the expected amount needed to retire comfortably.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.180]   And that number was $1.3 million.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.740]   And then the actual amount currently
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:06.740]   saved across all age brackets, which was $89,300.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.220]   So there is a huge, huge 1.2 plus million gap
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.060]   in terms of the expected amount and the amount currently
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.900]   saved.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.180]   And if we look at, let's say, the expected amount needed
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.460]   to retire comfortably for those in their 50s,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.500]   that number was 1.6 million.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.980]   That's a huge number.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.780]   But the actual amount that people in their 50s saved
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.260]   was only about $111,000.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.620]   And then if you look at the 60s, this is interesting.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.780]   The expected amount drops from 1.6 million
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.660]   for people in their 50s to only $968,000
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.100]   once they're in their 60s.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.420]   So something happens there where people transition
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.500]   from working in their 50s to retiring in their 60s,
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.580]   because most people retire in their 60s.
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.460]   And I think they realize, oh, actually, it
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.900]   doesn't cost as much to retire as I thought it did.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.140]   It actually costs maybe $700,000 less.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.980]   So that's a good thing, folks.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:12.740]   But the bad thing is the actual amount people in their 60s
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.580]   saved was only $112,500.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:22.180]   So still about an $850,000 gap.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.780]   So once again, there seems to be a disconnect with how much
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.900]   we think we need to retire and live comfortably
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.260]   and how much we actually have.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.460]   And I can explain the one thing that I realized
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.680]   after I retired in 2012.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.700]   And that is, once I retired, I didn't
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.620]   realize I no longer needed to save for retirement.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.580]   Because if I was truly retired and happy with the net worth
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.860]   and the investments that I had, I no longer had to save.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.940]   So I was saving 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, maybe 80%
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.660]   of my after-tax income over the last 10 years before I retired.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.080]   So if you think about it that way,
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.620]   let's say I made $200,000 after-tax,
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.940]   just for ease of numbers.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.820]   And I was saving 70% of that.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.940]   That means, what was I living off?
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.820]   $60,000, right?
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.480]   So suddenly, if I retire, I can not
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.940]   have to save $140,000 anymore.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.980]   And when I did leave in 2012, I had about $80,000
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.380]   in passive and semi-passive investment income.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.180]   So suddenly, I didn't have to save 70% anymore.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:37.260]   And I was living off $80,000, which after-tax, let's say,
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.380]   is about $60,000.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.980]   Tax rate is not that high at $80,000.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.380]   And then, boom, there you go.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.980]   I realized I was able to maintain
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.020]   a similar standard of living, but I just
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.380]   didn't save more for retirement.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.140]   Which actually felt really weird,
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.540]   because I had been saving so aggressively for so long.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.540]   So that is an inside scoop that I felt firsthand.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.820]   And hopefully, this gives people a little bit better calibration
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.220]   of how much they actually need.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.820]   You probably don't need as much as you think.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.580]   We talk a lot about the 4% rule, the rate of withdrawal,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.500]   the safe rate of withdrawal.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.180]   We talk about the financial samurai safe rate
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.860]   of withdrawal, which is 80% of the 10-year bond yield, which
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.780]   is the risk-free rate.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.660]   We also talk about trying to get a net worth
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.300]   equal to 10 to 20 times your average gross income.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.620]   I think using a multiple of gross income is more honest.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.620]   It's more challenging.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.620]   It's better, because you can't cheat your way
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.660]   to early retirement or financial independence
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.100]   by slashing your expenses to almost nothing.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.620]   Sydney, I've been talking a lot.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.740]   What are your thoughts about where we are, where you are?
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.460]   How do you feel about going into the later part of your years
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.620]   in your 50s and 60s?
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.020]   And how do you think about retirement in general?
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.460]   I don't feel like I'm retired.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.580]   I don't have a traditional 9 to 5 job anymore.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.860]   But I'm working independently.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.820]   And I feel comfortable with the amount
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.980]   that I have saved if I combine all of my retirement accounts
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.620]   and my after-tax investment accounts.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.380]   And also, just with the way we live our lives,
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:25.580]   I think we have a lot of frugal ways in our day-to-day living.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.140]   And I feel comfortable with that.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.740]   OK, so you don't feel like we're in trouble
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.900]   without having two jobs with retirement benefits
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.780]   and other benefits.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.660]   I think we are saving and investing
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.020]   to supplement the lack of having those traditional retirement
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.340]   accounts now.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.220]   OK, so it seems like we see these numbers,
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.620]   these very low numbers, every single year.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.500]   Every single year, we'll have a survey, oh,
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.420]   the median 401(k) balance, so low.
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.380]   Median IRA balance, so low.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.700]   The median amount people have saved overall, so low.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.020]   But yet, life goes on.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.460]   Life continues to go on in general pretty solidly,
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.500]   at least here in America.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.140]   So it seems to me that we have enough safety nets,
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.820]   whether it's through the pension, social security,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:25.540]   401(k), IRA, SEP IRA, 403(b), and also side jobs and hustles,
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.260]   where things will probably be OK, hopefully, for most people.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.980]   And also, there's this huge inheritance windfall
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.700]   that's coming.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.300]   And it's supposedly tens of trillions of dollars
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.700]   as the boomer generation passes away and leaves it
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.420]   to the Gen X and the millennials.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.820]   And given that the boomers have been investing and saving
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.660]   for the longest, during the biggest and longest bull
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.580]   market in history, there's a lot of wealth transfer to be had.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.540]   Thoughts on that?
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.300]   Yeah, we've been hearing about that for many years
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.860]   now, about how much is out there that's
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.020]   going to be transferred down.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.740]   And you and I know that we're not
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.860]   getting any secret inheritance from our own parents.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:11.020]   But I think there are a lot of adults our age out there
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.420]   who will.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.340]   And I think I'm seeing it all around here,
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.300]   at least here in San Francisco, where
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.460]   I see a lot of adult males continuously
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.780]   live at home with their parents in their 20s and 30s
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.780]   and maybe now 40s.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.380]   And then their parents, let's say, pass away
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.420]   or they have another home.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.340]   And they just end up living in their parents' homes.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.820]   And so the easiest and most common wealth transfer,
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.860]   I think, is a home.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.100]   And another, I think, good wealth transfer
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.060]   is using a 529 account.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.940]   So instead of giving money, give the gift of education.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.020]   And that's something we're focusing on,
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.860]   although community college is looking more and more
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.660]   appealing.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.460]   But that's the topic of a new episode.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.460]   All right, everyone.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.260]   I hope you enjoyed this episode.

[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.660]   of a job you dislike, definitely try to negotiate a severance
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.700]   instead of quit your job, because there's
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.220]   nothing to lose that way.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:36.740]   Go to financialsamurai.com/hteyl for how
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.740]   to engineer your layoff.
