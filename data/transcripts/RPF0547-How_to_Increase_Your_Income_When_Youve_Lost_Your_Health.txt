[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:27.560]   however
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:46.040]   ì—´ë, really,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:59.020]   Now, if you don't have disability income insurance,
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:04.000]   and yet you're dependent on your income,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.680]   stop what you're doing and go buy some.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.240]   Learn from Sarah's experience.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.480]   And listen to how hard everything that I'm about to share with Sarah is.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.020]   It's a lot easier if you can sit back and think,
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.020]   and it's a lot easier if you can sit back and think,
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.020]   and it's a lot easier if you can sit back and think,

[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   and it's a lot easier if you can sit back and think, and think,
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:51.980]   whip
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.760]   men,,, not
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:24.300]   worked
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:40.000]   discuss the say cuÃ¡nt
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:49.380]   so learn from Sarah's experience and go and buy disability income insurance.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.380]   Don't waste time. Don't think, "Oh, I'll do it next year."
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.380]   Go and do it today.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.380]   Now that you've done that, let's talk about what to do if you can't get insurance.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.380]   Let's talk about what Sarah can do.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:11.400]   I think it makes sense for you to invest your income and your assets into regaining and rebuilding your health to whatever extent you can.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   I think it makes sense for you to invest your income and your assets into regaining and rebuilding your health to whatever extent you can.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   I think it makes sense for you to invest your income and your assets into regaining and rebuilding your health to whatever extent you can.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   I think it makes sense for you to invest your income and your assets into regaining and rebuilding your health to whatever extent you can.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:37.460]   I think it makes logical sense if you know of a way to increase your health by draining your bank accounts, by draining your investment accounts, by selling your house and your car, etc. I think it makes logical sense to do that and to prioritize your health over your money.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.460]   I really don't see any other way around it.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.460]   I really don't see any other way around it.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.440]   Now, you can't always spend money on the right side of the screen.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   Now, you can't always spend money on the right side of the screen.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   Now, you can't always spend money on the right side of the screen.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   Now, you can't always spend money on the right side of the screen.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   Now, you can't always spend money on the right side of the screen.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   right side of the screen.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:51.480]   But if you can spend money to buy health, do it.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   right side of the screen.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.480]   right side of the screen.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480]   right side of the screen. Years ago, I worked with a client.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.500]   Years ago, I worked with a client.

[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   But this particular client, older clients in their retirement age in their 60s, she was facing a significant health problem.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:13.540]   And the details are coming back now. She had been exposed to some dangerous chemicals at work.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:13.540]   And the details are coming back now. She had been exposed to some dangerous chemicals at work.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.540]   And the details are coming back now. She had been exposed to some dangerous chemicals at work. And these dangerous chemicals were really having a damaging effect on her health.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:15.540]   And these dangerous chemicals were really having a damaging effect on her health.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.540]   And these dangerous chemicals were really having a damaging effect on her health.

[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:44.620]   It's not unusual to find a house where the entire property is a nursery.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:44.620]   They got palm trees planted and nice lines all around the property here in Florida.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:44.620]   There's a huge business for palms. You can sell palms that are mature for a lot of money. They got the house, the property planted with palm trees. They're all planned to be grown and to grow.

[00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:12.140]   What's the point of having a manicured, perfect lawn that you pay a guy to come and cut when you can instead plant thousands of plants in pots that you can sell right out of your front driveway?
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.640]   The guy used to put a lot of money in there.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:14.640]   It's not unusual to go and sell a lot of money in there.
