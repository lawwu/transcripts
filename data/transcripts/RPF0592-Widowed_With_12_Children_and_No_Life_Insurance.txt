[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.720]   the fact that they were teaching and then they would
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:39.800]   teaching and then they would
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.760]   teaching and then they would take over the teaching.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:40.820]   take over the teaching.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.760]   take over the teaching. I can empathize with him

[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.760]   I can empathize with him because I don't do well

[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.760]   because I don't do well with the idea of teaching
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:45.840]   with the idea of teaching
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.860]   with the idea of teaching our little ones.

[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:35.680]   I think that's one of the best, the best things that, that can happen is, is it seems to me segueing into educational philosophy because so at this point, me out, me back up.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.220]   So you homeschooled many children for many years.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.000]   So you probably have seen all kinds of different traditions, had all kinds of exposure.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.600]   But one of the things I wish more and more for is I wish for a less age segregated society so that the way that.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.460]   In my opinion, the way that learning happens, at least for me.

[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:41.580]   So, he had also, I don't know when that came in, but he, he felt bad about being on a salary, because when he didn't work very much, then he'd still get a whole lot of money.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.580]   And when he worked a whole lot, he didn't get very much money.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.380]   So he had negotiated that with his boss somewhere along the line there.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.380]   He did.
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.480]   That he would be paid on an hourly.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   He didn't get paid on an hourly.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.480]   He didn't get paid on an hourly.

[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:17.620]   It's a little bit of a long story, but yeah. In the midst of all of that. We still just loved it. We just loved the beauty of the place primarily. So you bought the place as raw land, forested mountainous land, right? Right. And also the area is, like I said, very fruitful. Right. And so there was nothing here, no infrastructure when you moved here. And so what did you do? How did you develop the property? The first thing that we did was bring in power. But to do that,
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   There was a woman who came to help and she was like six feet tall and very strong and with a big heart. And she came and helped us. And it took quite a lot of doing also to dig the hole for the outhouse because there are a lot of rocks in the ground.

[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:41.240]   Right.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:59.960]  , and so the idea of being fruitful kind of grew in my mind and I thought it would be a pleasure to be fruitful. And so that's I kind of went through that rebellion. So then after that, then it was kind of a free for all except that we spaced the children too.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.280]   Right.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:06.520]   Well, I can understand that with the age of our children there in my end.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.280]   I always had this theory that the hardest time is when you have multiple young ones, but you have to be patient with the young ones.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:41.300]  , and I think that's true that most children I ever had was two or three. I think right. Right. Right. Right. That was the most I ever had because after that I had help. Right. Right. And that's it told my wife that from the very beginning. I said I'm convinced that three is the hardest number and that's so valuable for the younger ones and that's so valuable for the younger ones.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:51.340]   So it's the hardest thing for them to help them develop character and be able to grow as adults. So when you moved here to build the cabin, how old was your oldest? Do you remember about?
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.340]   Yes, when we moved here she was 12.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.340]   Okay.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.340]   And probably well when we were in the house I know we were in the house and things were you know pretty civilized.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.340]   Right.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.340]   Then we had.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.340]   Did you have glass in the window?
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.340]   Yes, we did.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.340]   We had glass in the window.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.340]   We had glass in the window.
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.340]   Yes, we had glass in the window.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.340]   And you know we had glass in the window.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.340]   Yes, we had glass in the window.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.340]   We had glass in the window.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.340]   Yes, we had glass in the window.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.340]   Yes, we had glass in the window.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.340]   And we had glass in the window.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.340]   We had glass in the window.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:38.380]   Yes.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   Then we had.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   Yes.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   Most of them.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   Most of them.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:45.480]   Bes
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:26.380]   all right so did jack's health improve when you moved out here no so the in fact it got worse okay so the allergens the things the toxins didn't seem to have a directed influence as you thought yeah maybe maybe that's right okay um and if um i i just don't think we were able to get away from everything
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.800]   even being out here
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.300]   yes got it

[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.480]   so he went ahead and went on high blood pressure medication then
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   so he went ahead and went on high blood pressure medication then
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.760]   so he went ahead and went on high blood pressure medication then people have frowned at him about not going on high blood pressure
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:08.760]   people have frowned at him about not going on high blood pressure
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.400]   people have frowned at him about not going on high blood pressure medication before that but he was trying to see if he
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   medication before that but he was trying to see if he
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.920]   medication before that but he was trying to see if he could help
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   could help
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.640]   could help oh yes okay the medication helped a lot
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   oh yes okay the medication helped a lot
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:21.000]   oh yes okay the medication helped a lot okay um so so um so that so then
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   okay um so so um so that so then
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.240]   okay um so um so then um fast forward a number of years
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.560]   fast forward a number of years living in the house built the house
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:35.820]  ,
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:54.300]  gio continue of just
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.560]   tighter than that because he just didn't have that kind of work.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:05.760]   Then he and the kids did lawn mowing and raking leaves and things like that.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.260]   Any kind of jobs that would come up.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:16.560]   So by virtue of being out of debt though and having a paid for house and the area we were in has relatively low taxes and such.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:23.460]   Even though he wasn't able to work in his high-paying occupation as a chemist, he was still able to support the family with
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:23.480]   relatively manual labor.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   He was still able to support the family with relatively manual labor.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   He was still able to support the family with relatively manual labor.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:23.480]   He was still able to support the family with relatively manual labor.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:23.660]   He was still able to support the family with relatively manual labor.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:23.700]   He was still able to support the family with relatively manual labor.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:23.760]   He was still able to support the family with relatively manual labor.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:45.180]  , except that we also had opportunities in this area because things do grow here.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:33:00.120]   And so by this time I knew how to can and freeze and dry things.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:06.020]   And so that also made it easy to live here.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.460]   What is your analysis as a mother of the cost of children?
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.320]   You know, there's a famous U.S. department of... I can't remember which department.

[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:20.860]   guessing maybe we had at least 10 children he figured out that we were
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:27.940]   averaging 50 cents a meal per person okay Wow so when we we thought about
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:39.260]   buying an apple he said Ann an apple cost 50 cents we weren't gonna buy it in the winter you know right right there's definitely a different in the economies of
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:35:08.200]   and the great thing is those don't have to be opposed healthfully and inexpensively so Jack died when he was 61

[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:37.140]   and the great thing is those don't have to be opposed healthfully and inexpensively so Jack died when he was 61 correct right now did did you and he know that he was going to die was he kind of yeah well so when he went on the blood pressure medication he found out that his kidneys were functioning half of what they should and then later when he was working at a well actually he was going to go to Cincinnati and work at a place where they did radioactive and then later when he was working at a well actually he was going to go to Cincinnati and work at a place where they did radioactive
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:37.140]   and then later when he was working at a well actually he was going to go to Cincinnati and work at a place where they did radioactive

[00:35:37.280 --> 00:36:07.080]  , they had radioactive materials there he had to take a short course to learn how to be safe in that place he also had to shave off his beard so that he could wear a mask right but at that time he had to have a physical exam so that they would know what his baseline health was so that he couldn't sue them later for the damage that he'd received at the plant and they at that time he learned that his kidneys weren't quarter so that he couldn't sue them later for the damage that he'd received at the plant and they at that time he learned that his kidneys weren't quarter
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:37.020]   of functioning and the doctor then said you have in three years you'll need dialysis in five years you'll need a transplant he said you're in great health except that you're going to die tomorrow right well if you know you're going to die at least you could be in good health until until that happens so he so you and he had an expectation that the days could be short there was no clarity on timing but you had an expectation that the days could be short so he and he had an expectation that the days could be short so he and he had an expectation that the days could be short

[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.480]   it was obvious that he was getting worse rather than better and that it looked
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.500]   like God was not going to answer our prayers to heal him.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:23.140]   And we considered dialysis and dialysis at that time,
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:28.060]   if you were able to do the in home dialysis, which was not a good option for Jack, um,
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:32.480]   for other reasons, um, in home dialysis, uh,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.540]   would cost $30,000 a year.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   He didn't even know what dialysis was.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   He didn't even know what dialysis was.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:38:03.300]  , he didn't know what dialysis was. He didn't make $30,000 a year.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.300]   Wow.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:32.100]  , he didn't make $30,000 a year. Um,

[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   You know, all these people, financial counselors say you ought to have savings.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   You know, maybe we should be having a savings thing, Jack.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   He said, "Yeah, Ann, we're never going to need money more than we need it right now."
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   That's the challenge, yeah.
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   No, we didn't have money in the bank to speak of and we didn't have life insurance. I don't know that he was opposed to that. Well, he probably wouldn't have qualified, you know, once he started to develop those types of symptoms, he hardly would have qualified.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:41:00.940]   life insurance anyway. So I can put your mind at ease. Yeah, no. That is a long time seller of life insurance. It's always, I'm always interested to learn. Okay, but we did have somebody who was presenting a life insurance policy to us. And when he found out that we really hadn't been to doctors to speak of, he said, "Oh, I might be able to give you get you life insurance, you know, because there's nothing on record that shows that you have, but we didn't want to do that. And we didn't have money for that. Right, absolutely.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:00.940]   But we didn't want to do that. And we didn't have money for that. Right, absolutely.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:30.960]  ,
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   We didn't have money for that. Right, absolutely.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   So, you know, you make choices. Yeah.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   And then you live with those choices that you make.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   Right, absolutely.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   I appreciate people who are clear on their convictions, their conscience, and who walk up rightly without sacrificing those things. And I really appreciate that.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   I thought of one more thing. There was a chart that I saw, and I showed it to Jack, and it was talking about the outcome, like if you have a kidney transplant, and it was showing
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:31.000]   the outcome, like if you have a kidney transplant, and it was showing
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   and it was showing how long people lived after a kidney transplant, what the statistics were.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   It was a graph, and it showed how long people lived after a kidney transplant, what the statistics were.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   It was a graph, and it showed how long people lived after a kidney transplant, what the statistics were.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   If you had one early on before your kidneys were too bad, you had a lot better chance of it lasting for quite a long time. But on this chart, they had cut out all the people who died in for six weeks after the transplant, and they had cut out all the people who had who were diabetic also, so that they weren't part of this.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Right.
