[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.080]   skills insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.640]   plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua I am your host and today I'm
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.200]   thrilled to bring you a special story from a friend of mine who we are sitting face to face
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.600]   her name is Anne and we're sitting here in her home and I've known Anne's story for a while it's
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.280]   been inspirational to me and I thought how better to bring you something really useful as far as
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.120]   a little bit of of her story and how better to bring what better what better way to bring you
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.320]   a story of unusual financial circumstances than the story of an older lady a widow with 12 children
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.680]   whose husband died when how old was your youngest at that time and 10 months so you had you had at
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.120]   that time you and he had 12 children and your youngest was 10 months your oldest was in her
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.480]   early 20s and he had no life insurance is that right that's correct and I thought this would
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.920]   just be a a great story and a very inspirational and encouraging story that I really wanted to
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.840]   share with my audience so now that I've given just a little bit of an introduction I would love to
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.160]   back up a little bit tell me the story of you and your husband how you met how you married and how
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.560]   you came to build a life together yeah that's kind of a long story let's see what I can do
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:46.240]   um I'll make it short uh there was 15 years difference in our ages and when I was uh going
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:55.680]   to the university um I uh now how do I do this let's see I was taking a chemistry class that
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.760]   was very difficult for me because I wasn't good at math right and um my chemistry partner was
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.080]   not any better than I was and he told me that I should get together with this guy named Jack
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.960]   because Jack could help me with the chemistry he didn't just wouldn't just help me with
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.720]   a particular problem that I had what would make me understand where the problem was and bring me up
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.240]   to date I thought no I didn't want to go through all that bother so I didn't meet Jack at that time
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.200]   but Jack is the one that I eventually married wow um and the way we met was at that my chemistry
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.440]   partners lab partner um had a going away party and both of us were invited to that party so um
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.840]   Jack offered to walk me home afterwards I thought oh yeah this is just a wolf you know
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.120]   but um he was a gentleman he didn't want to see me walking home at night alone and we got to
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.160]   talking about the chronicles of Narnia and we both liked them and so we started up a chronicles of
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.400]   Narnia study etc etc etc you can take it from there but we had a um uh we enjoyed each other
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   we got to know each other over time both of us at that time were committed to staying single unless
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.600]   God made it evident that we should get married to the other person and God made it evident so when
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.400]   did you marry we married in 1975 okay and at that time you were living out here in the western
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.760]   United States and uh your husband was working as a chemist yes he yes he was an analytical chemist
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.520]   wow and one of the things that I find most interesting is as his career developed even
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.720]   prior to the days of of uh of computer connection he worked out the ability to work remotely how
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.120]   did that come to happen okay so we wanted to move from where we lived um he had developed some
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.000]   health problems he had high blood pressure and he was using okay so he's a scientist and he was
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.880]   using himself as a guinea pig to find out what was causing it he came to the conclusion that
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.960]   at least one thing that was um influencing his blood pressure was that he was chemically sensitive
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.440]   okay and we were living in a place he had built a house for us in a place that had chemical exposure
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.960]   okay and we couldn't get away from that in our house we tried internally like with indoor air
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.840]   pollution to get rid of all plastics and all scented products and things like that but we
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.400]   were still not able to get rid of the chemicals there so we decided to move somewhere where we
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.800]   could build another house and um have it be chemically clean and where there was clean water
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.440]   and clean air and um preferably where food could grow and we could grow clean food and I think jack
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.840]   had in the back of his mind to to um move the family to a place where food was growing in
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.400]   abundance because I think that he also thought well it may be that I'll die from this um high
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:02.080]   blood pressure and um so we moved to a place that was a friendlier climate for food growing and um
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.880]   boy there was a lot of food there was a lot extra that nobody wanted that was going to waste
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   we'll get to that as the story progresses but I want to when did he become sick was he sick
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   before you married or did his illnesses emerge after you married it was emerged afterwards in
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.200]   fact we probably it was um after we had four children so however however long that is and so
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.640]   did did you think that did it seem like um could could he pinpoint a specific cause or he just
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.600]   started to develop ill health well he found out that he had high blood pressure okay and he um it
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.480]   was he had a headache right and so he went and uh to a chiropractor who had helped him before to get
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.120]   rid of a headache right found out his blood pressure was high right so in in his research
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.200]   into his own symptoms he came to you came to understand that um the various environmental
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.800]   toxins were really causing him to to feel worse and have a lot of problems yes and so one of the
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.480]   solutions that there were the solution that you came up with was to move to a more rural area
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   where you would be more able to build your own home and build it free of toxins which today is
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.160]   very in vogue today you can pay lots of money to have products that you know low voc paint and all
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.120]   kinds of things but this was during the mid 80s do i have my timing right early 80s probably yes
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.880]   so early to mid 80s but he didn't have a source of income in the new place he was depending on
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.800]   the other source of income right do you remember how he worked so this this is prior to the days
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.000]   of email this is prior to the days of i guess you had telephones faxes physical you know going for
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.720]   business and and letters right those are your major right methods of communication maybe you
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   could overnight packages with fedex but it was you could it was certainly more expensive then
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.840]   than it is now to do that how did he approach his boss and how did those negotiations go to be able
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.400]   to do this yes well um jack was kind of peculiar in lots of ways right um one of those that he had
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.200]   been working full-time until we got married and then when we were expecting our first baby i'm
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.040]   backing up here when we were expecting our first baby um he went to half-time and the reason why
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.080]   he went to half-time work was because he was thinking where on earth is this child going to go
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.920]   to go to school right so he started researching and then began a christian school for the town
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:32.880]   where we were living really and by the time she was um five years old though to ready to go into
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.920]   the kindergarten that he had established uh he was thinking oh no homeschooling is the way to go
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.880]   this is the so he um he phased himself out of the christian school so that we could homeschool our
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.560]   children wow and um but then as time went on by the time we were living um away from the town
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.320]   where he was being supported he had gone to quarter time wow now i think that you know that's
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:05.760]   helped by um being paid a lot per hour because he had his doctorate in chemistry right and he could
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.640]   earn more money per hour but he wanted also to devote himself to one building shelter for us and
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:21.520]   two um teaching the children so most homeschooling families the mom is the teacher in ours jack was
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.080]   the primary teacher wow we had a deal that i would take the little kids until they were
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.280]   fluent readers and then he would take over the teaching there i can empathize with him because
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:38.400]   i don't i don't do well with uh the idea of teaching our our little ones so my wife seems
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:45.760]   to just i i work at it but she just seems to have a a bet an easier time with the patients now but i
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.840]   don't i don't think i'm okay with the idea of her doing all the schooling for the older ones because
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.320]   i get so excited about all my ideas i'm like i want to do the teaching and they get a little
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.800]   bit older but teaching to read is not doesn't so i think jack and i are probably alike in a lot of
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.480]   ways yeah well and he loved he loved being with the little ones too it's just that sure um one of
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.040]   my jobs was keeping the little guys out of the way while he was teaching the bigger kids right
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.880]   but you know there's a lot do you know that there's a lot of osmosis that goes on there that
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.240]   you're teaching the older kids and the little kids pick up on it oh yeah absolutely i think
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.400]   that's one of the best the best things that that can happen is is it seems to me
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.440]   segwaying into educational philosophy because so at this point me out maybe back up so you
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.000]   homeschooled many children for many years yes so you probably have seen all kinds of different
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.120]   traditions had all kinds of exposure but one of the things i wish more and more for is i wish for
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.520]   a less age segregated society so that the way that in my opinion the way that learning happens at
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.960]   least for me is i get exposed to something i get an idea and then you circle around and you get
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.440]   it better and better and over time you learn more and more so that's what the one room schoolhouse
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:58.240]   model kind of provided that it provided exposure and and older children could teach younger children
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.560]   some of the concepts and that would cement those concepts for them younger children could be
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.200]   exposed to things that older children were working on and they would start to peak interest to
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.320]   interests at different times right and i think it seems like the one room schoolhouse model is
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.560]   is a thing of the past with the exception of a homeschooling environment where you can have
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.480]   that older and younger structure so i can also if you leave your son to teach the younger ones the
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:30.720]   canadian provinces you come back and they're jiving it that's funny so i'll just point out
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.760]   for the sake of my audience because in jack's story there are some lessons that i are things
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:42.480]   that i frequently wish to impress upon my listeners and one of those is if you have
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:49.040]   developed your skills in the marketplace so that they are highly marketable then in in the equation
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.920]   of time you don't always have to keep working 60 hours a week if your if your hourly rate is much
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.760]   higher it provides you with opportunities to make some of these life changes as as jack did and we
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.880]   lived quite simply on that quarter time but why did you live simply from the beginning
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:17.440]   i think partly largely um i guess we didn't feel like it we needed to spend a lot of money on
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.360]   ourselves and jack liked to do everything himself he liked to start from scratch on things and um
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.320]   it made it so you could give more money away right so back so in that time period if that was late
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.680]   70s early 80s you would have been involved kind of in the vanguard of of the homeschool revolution
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.640]   that happened in the united states was homeschooling legal when you started with your
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:46.000]   children well in our state it it was a moot point nobody knew and so jack was instrumental in helping
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.800]   that homeschool law to be written great well as a younger parent to an older i say thank you
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:57.040]   i've studied a little bit of the history of what many of you did during the 80s and we younger
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:03.040]   parents are very appreciative for relatively how easy we have it so so thank you for that
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.160]   so you guys went on and he built a house the house that you lived in and then found out about the
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.880]   toxins and so at that time uh you were moving so back to how we negotiated that with his employer
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:20.560]   he was already working a quarter time okay yes so um um he had also i don't know when that came in
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:30.160]   but he he felt bad about being on a salary uh because um when he didn't work very much
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.440]   then he'd still get a whole lot of money and when he worked a whole lot he didn't get very much
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.920]   money so he had negotiated that with his boss somewhere along the line there he did um that
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.720]   he would be paid on an hourly basis and so um he felt then the liberty to to spend more time
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.440]   building on the house sometimes and then when money was short he'd work a whole lot of chemistry
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:01.520]   work and so that worked out really well too um i think that his boss valued him and uh was willing
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:08.640]   to work with what he could do and jack was demonstrating that he could come down to be uh
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.480]   on site sometimes um when needed but otherwise there was a whole lot that he could do just he
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.720]   would travel back and forth from the more rural location to the more city location where the
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.360]   employer was right and the rest of the time phone calls faxes faxes were the packages
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.840]   and then we did get fedex a lot great great so when you moved to uh this rural location
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:37.600]   what was it that attracted you to this area beauty that we um there were various people
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.840]   that told us uh we would ask people that we'd meet who seemed to have similar views that we had
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.440]   what's the best place in the world and they would tell us various places and um so one time we
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.160]   decided to take a trip and look at some of those places and somewhere in between we found what we
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:01.840]   really liked and um it uh it has i'm going to go ahead and say it has mountains and it has water
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:08.000]   and it has um trees and it's beautiful right right and we're just being slightly cagey with the
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.920]   details just for your own benefit to avoid having any uh publicity which would be an annoyance to
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.800]   you uh our audience can figure that out but but you were telling me the story you and he were up
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.320]   here um you had five children and you're camping in the area and you're camping by a lake and you
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.120]   fell in love with the place but here you are you got five little children in a tent your tent blew
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.360]   blew down in the middle of the night there was a big storm that came up the tent blew down we had
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:40.560]   to dig our way out of the canvas you know to get to the van um and then the rain came down but uh
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.960]   yeah in the midst of all of that we still just loved it we just loved the the beauty of the
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.800]   place primarily so you bought the place as raw land forested mountainous land right right right
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.000]   and also that the area is like i said very fruitful right and so there's nothing there
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.440]   was nothing here no infrastructure uh when you moved here and so what did you do how did you
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:09.520]   develop the property the first thing that we did was um bring in power okay but to do that it um
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.320]   the power company wanted 20 feet of free space with no trees around it so that 20 foot swath
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.280]   down the hill took six weeks to clear chainsaws chainsaws two tractors there was a a woman who
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.680]   came to help and she was like six feet tall and very strong wow and with a big heart and she came
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   and helped us wow and um it took quite a lot of doing also to dig the hole for the outhouse because
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.480]   there are a lot of rocks in this ground so that wasn't very practical of us if we wanted to be
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:46.800]   building um like having a garden and growing food to buy a hillside that had lots of rocks
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:53.280]   but um we loved the view so much that we went ahead did that and then uh over time jack built
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.800]   the soil up and made the flower bed you know the garden beds so it was about 10 acres right
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.760]   it was 10 acres 10 acres that you bought do you remember how much you paid for it
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:09.040]   yes it was um 15 000 for the 10 acres did you he paid for it you paid for it with savings that you
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.080]   guys had well that was how did you finance we sold the house okay where we had lived before that jack
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   built now he when he built that house it was also he built it um we didn't go into debt for the land
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.480]   and we didn't go into debt as we built the house but we also didn't get to move into it very soon
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.200]   either right and then we also moved into it a little sooner than we might have it because we
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:35.520]   wanted to put all the money into that house so when we sold that house um we had enough money
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:42.400]   to make the move and to buy the land and to begin building the new house and i'll just say that um
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:50.880]   at partway through um my father said you know this easement trouble that you're having you
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.280]   ought to just buy the other lot that's next to you so that's another 10 acres so we ended up with 20
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.600]   acres so we had a little less money for building the house when it came to building the house bit
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:07.840]   by bit jack worked and worked and he hired somebody um there was a young man in the church who was
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:17.760]   just a brand new christian and um as was jack's custom he wanted to input in this guy's life and
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.080]   the guy was big and strong too so he hired him to work with him on the project and then they could
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:31.440]   visit as they worked right did you and he before you married did you talk about things like not
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.000]   borrowing money for houses or was this the kind of thing that emerged after you married um there
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.120]   were some things about jack that well a lot of things about jack that i liked a lot one of them
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.920]   was that i kept hearing rumors okay so he worked full time and he made quite a lot of money and um
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.600]   people he didn't tell me but other people told me that okay so this guy who was in the geology
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   department um had a nice truck and it was because jack had bought the nice truck and then given it
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.400]   as a really good deal to this guy and there were just a lot of generous stories that i heard from
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:13.920]   other people so i knew that jack was a giver he he lived quite modestly and um i liked that i liked
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:26.160]   that about him that he um i guess didn't have a lot of toys so to speak and um his his hobbies were
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.640]   he loved fly fishing and hiking and things like that i just i liked the idea i guess i liked
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:39.680]   how simply he lived so i'll so so oh you asked did we talk about it when you were a how old
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.240]   were you when you married i was 21 and so he was then he was 36 right okay so when you were 21
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.640]   were um well let me give the background the reason i'm asking as a younger man to an older woman
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:19:00.160]   one of the challenges that i observe in marriage today is my wife my wife's generations
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:07.280]   generation many of our friends and many younger women are they've come from they've never known
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.840]   lack right now depending on the circumstances of course some people come from from lack some people
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:21.200]   have learned how to to um uh well many people come from difficult situations and my wife her you know
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.520]   she was raised by a single mom who had just a very small amount of money and so those lessons went
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.680]   deep within her and one of the things that i really appreciated about her and was attracted
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:37.680]   to that she was she was frugal she was she was not high maintenance she's not uh she's not high
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.240]   maintenance she doesn't require a lot she's not constantly frustrating with all the things that
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.360]   that she would like to have but a lot of um but i also have a lot of friends and many times their
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.240]   husbands uh you know when we're talking privately one of the things that's frustrating is how
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:59.760]   inflexible their wives are and one of the challenges for many husbands is how do i do
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:05.360]   some of the things that i'd like to do for our family that require sacrifice in the short term
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:11.840]   and it's a question i've thought a lot about and i've never quite known obvious known what to say
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.640]   other than be careful before you marry marry somebody who's not high maintenance marry somebody
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.400]   who's willing to to do that and then be willing to carefully share and work diligently to share
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:29.200]   over time a vision and to show how times of sacrifice are temporary but when i when i hear
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.280]   your story and when you uh talk about you know being young and and building a house moving into
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:42.160]   the house before it's finished uh and of course having five small children when your husband is
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.680]   building a house a cabin in the woods though that's hard it's it seems romantic when you read
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.560]   the book but they're here about it but it's a lot of hard sweaty days and a lot of crying
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:21:00.880]   children and a lot of penny pinching and a lot of going without nice things and it i guess i'm not
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.960]   i guess the the question i'm i'm wondering is did you were you went along with those and you went
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.000]   along with those ideas you went along with your husband in that was that something that he led
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   you in after being married or were you always that kind of adventurous person that's a good question
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.120]   and i don't know how he would have known to evaluate me on that either um i know that as a
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.880]   girl i used to grow up i had a friend named claudia and we would play um brave pioneer woman
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.080]   and what that was was basically i dare you to do this because a brave pioneer woman would
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:43.280]   do this right and it was very stupid things that we did with each other but i kind of had that um
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.560]   that was kind of a something that i liked when i was in junior high was that idea of being a brave
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:54.480]   pioneer woman so um uh i think that sometimes people have looked at our lives and looked at
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:02.000]   like that we had so many children and looked at like sometimes um uh okay so one time there was
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.800]   a man who came to visit us when we lived in our log house we didn't have glass in the windows yet
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   we didn't have a door yet we didn't you know and um and he said jack you're a rich man
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:23.840]   and he was looking at the family and um the the family riches that we had not it was obvious not
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:32.800]   what we had in our um like materially um but um i just want to say that jack uh and i did these
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:40.880]   things together it wasn't um it wasn't that he was leading me necessarily i mean he did lead me
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:48.400]   but he it wasn't that he pushed me or uh presumed on me like for things he he and i were in on it
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:57.760]   together and um one thing that goes into this is that uh jack with a strong christian slant was
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.480]   practically libertarian in his politics jack and i would have gotten along really well
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.280]   the more i learned about him i met him once when i was a kid but the more i learned about him we
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.520]   would have we would have talked for hours that's funny so um so but that extended to like he he
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.000]   hated to even pin up the goats that we had and the chickens that we had he'd like liberty liberty was
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.480]   so important to him and as his wife he was so um he was concerned with my liberty too so he was not
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:34.960]   pushing anything on me i remember when we were building the house in um that city place um he
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.280]   said you know if i'm going to be building this then i'm not going to be available to help with
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:46.080]   the children and that was when we had three children and um he said is it worth it is is
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.080]   that going to is that going to be something you can live with that i'm not going to be here to be
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.320]   helping with dishes or kids or you know a lot of this you're going to be on your own
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.240]   and i said okay well yeah i think it's worth it i don't it's that doesn't feel you know i don't
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.600]   that doesn't appeal to me but we're going to just have to remember that together as time goes on and
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.840]   it's hard then we'll just say yeah but remember we thought it was worth it so we were going to
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.920]   remind each other oh yeah it's worth it and it really was worth it but we did um count the cost
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.480]   before we started did you and jack hope to have a large family from the early years or how did
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.120]   that emerge we were we wanted to have children but we sure didn't think we were going to have
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   as many as we did um i was just talking to your wife about this um earlier uh what happened was
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:39.760]   we had four pretty much in a row and um and then jack said you know you're bushed you're tired
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:49.520]   no more kids until you rest up right so um we were uh very careful to not have any more children for
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:55.680]   a time and then i went through a kind of a rebellion and it was a rebellion against the
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:04.000]   societal uh norms in the united states um and the the thing was that i was seeing just sex sex sex
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.200]   you know like as far as movies and advertising and things like that but not connected to children
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:19.360]   and um and not necessarily in marriage like marriage married people are so careful and um
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:28.720]   i liked the idea of um planting when it's time for something to grow and not using herbicide
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.880]   and pesticide and whatever to make things not grow right and so the idea of being fruitful
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.520]   kind of grew in my mind and i thought it would be a a pleasure to be fruitful and so that's
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.480]   i kind of went through that rebellion so then um after that then it was kind of a free-for-all
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:55.040]   except that we spaced the children too right well i can understand that with um the age of our
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.800]   children they're in my and i always had this theory that the hardest time is when you have
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.120]   multiple young ones but your oldest is not old enough to help i think that's true that most
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.760]   children i ever had was two or three i think right maybe four that was the most i ever had
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.800]   because after that i had help right right and that's uh i told my wife that from the very
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:21.120]   beginning i said i'm convinced that three is the hardest number because your oldest is not you're
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:27.200]   outnumbered and yet your oldest is basically still useless whereas beyond that uh your oldest can be
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:32.480]   more useful and can help you to work with the younger ones and and that's so valuable for them
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:38.720]   to help them develop character and be able to to grow as adults so when you moved um here to build
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:46.320]   the cabin you had how old was your oldest do you remember about yes when we moved here she was 12
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:53.920]   okay um and probably well when we when we were in the house i know we were in the house um
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:03.360]   and things were you know pretty civilized um then we had glass in the windows yet yes or at least
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.120]   this most of them we had plastic over some of them you know um here's a trick for people who
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   are have plastic over their windows if you have cats put chicken wire over the plastic and then
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.560]   they can't scratch their way in good trick yeah it sounds from hard one experience that's right
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:27.520]   so um uh the oldest then was 14. okay okay so um now jack was not he he wasn't like he was a
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:34.720]   contractor no he was a he was a a self-taught man he was a uh he would learn himself so at that time
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.440]   he learned how to build from reading books asking questions right right right well and um the uh
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:50.720]   he had built a dog house before he built our house in in um the city and um the only class that ever
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:56.240]   got a dn was woodworking wow so um it was a challenge for him and another thing about him
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:04.400]   was that he um he tested out pretty strongly as a perfectionist at work right and then we did one
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.960]   for just as a couple and he was not nearly as perfectionistic so that was really a blessing
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:17.920]   for me because i'm not perfect right um but uh i loved it that he went ahead and um built and with
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:25.120]   a log house particularly everything is irregular you know um it's not dimensional logs and um
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:34.960]   he was willing to just do it and i encouraged him in it um and not worry about it not being perfect
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:42.160]   and that was that was great i i loved seeing that side of him right right to just go ahead
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.280]   well such a neat story and i think it should be more common than it is when you have somebody
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.440]   who is intensely intellectual um like a phd in chemistry and a working active research chemist
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.440]   i think it's often helpful to have an outlet for physical labor and be challenged and things that
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.280]   you're not you're not skilled in it's true and um i always noticed that my grandfather i don't know
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.520]   if you remember this but my grandfather was a chemist and he didn't have a phd i think he had
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.960]   a master's degree in chemistry but he taught chemistry for many years but he was also often
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.000]   working with things and i always felt like those two things go together really well to have an
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.880]   intensely intellectual pursuit and then also to have a chance to go out and work with something
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.480]   in your hands where it's where you have a chance for your body to work and your mind and he also
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:36.640]   found that so satisfying because with his chemistry he wasn't sure that he was actually benefiting
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:43.280]   mankind with it right um he had patents that had never been used and um he just didn't see that
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.680]   but when he would build a table we would eat on the table and when he built a house we lived in
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.400]   the house and when he planted you know seeds they would grow and we'd eat the things and that was
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:58.800]   very satisfying to him so did jack's health improve when you moved out here no so the in
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.320]   fact it got worse okay so the allergens the things the toxins didn't seem to have as direct an
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:13.600]   influence as you thought yeah maybe maybe that's right okay um and if um and i just don't think
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:20.720]   we were able to get away from everything even being out here that he would react to yes got it so um
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:31.360]   he um there came a point where his pattern had been that he would have um high blood pressure
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:38.240]   spikes that would last three days and then there'd be a time where it would just be normal high um
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:44.960]   and there came a point where uh instead of the three days it went five days and he said oops
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.200]   can't do this because when his blood pressure was super high he wasn't able to
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.560]   eat or sleep or think or anything so he went ahead and went on a high blood pressure medication then
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.640]   people have frowned at him about not going on high blood pressure medication before that but
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:07.200]   he was trying to see if he could did it help oh yes okay the the medication helped a lot okay um
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:15.760]   so so um so that so then um fast forward a number of years you living in the house built the house
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.480]   developing the land planting gardens and things but it's not a farm it's a you know we're in a
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:28.400]   mountainous rural place and um he was continuing to work as a chemist that whole time yes mostly
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.960]   um there he had been working for a mining company and then the mining um industry kind of tanked
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:42.240]   for a while so then he was involved in um environmental cleanup with some similar processes
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:50.080]   and um and then when money got uh tighter than that because he just didn't have that kind of work
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:56.880]   then he and the kids did lawn mowing wow and raking leaves and things like that any kind of
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:03.520]   jobs that would come up so by virtue of being out of debt though and having a paid-for house and
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.720]   the area we're in the area we were in has relatively low taxes and such even though he
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.360]   wasn't able to work in his high-paying occupation as a chemist he was still able to support the
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:20.080]   family with relatively manual labor is that yes yes except that we also had um opportunities in
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:27.680]   this area because things do grow here um it's easy to get free potatoes it's easy to get there are a
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.800]   lot of people who have fruit trees and they just have too much fruit and it's going to go to waste
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:40.080]   and so i went ahead and asked god to um alert me to food that was going to go to waste and i would
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:46.000]   i said my part will be i'll try really hard not to let it go to waste and so um by this time i
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:56.880]   knew how to to um can and freeze and dry things and so uh that also made it easy to live here
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.240]   what is your analysis as a mother of the cost of children you know there's a famous
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.880]   u.s department of uh camera which department was a famous government study that comes out and talks
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.160]   about how much each child costs and the range is something like 130 000 per year what's your
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:18.800]   perspective though as a mother of many as far as the costs of children okay somebody asked me this
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.320]   once and um and i was supposed to tell her specifically and i said you know it doesn't
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.480]   count we don't really count because um when we had our babies at home um so we didn't need to
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:37.200]   pay for hospital things and um another thing is that we really didn't go to the doctor very much
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:44.800]   and um and then also we uh had hand-me-downs people would give us clothes or else we would
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:51.680]   go to second-hand stores and get clothes um we just didn't do things traditionally
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.920]   that way so um i don't i have no idea but i know that at one point jack figured out
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:05.600]   with our um when we had a large family by this time probably i don't know i'm guessing maybe we
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:14.640]   had at least 10 children um he figured out that uh we were averaging 50 cents a meal per person
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:22.560]   okay wow so when we we thought about buying an apple he said and um an apple cost 50 cents
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:31.360]   right right there's definitely a different in the economies of scale when it comes to cooking
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.560]   for children there's you definitely i think embrace different recipes you embrace a different
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:42.480]   approach just to feed a lot of people healthfully versus uh versus a small number one of my grown
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.040]   daughters now who has children of her own said i used to think that we ate according to like
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:52.320]   healthful things now i realize we ate what was cheap and the great thing is those don't have
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:35:01.440]   to be opposed no no healthfully and inexpensively so jack died when he was 61 correct right now did
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:08.880]   did you and he know that he was going to die was he kind of okay yeah so when he went on his when
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.680]   he went on the blood pressure medication he found out that his kidneys were functioning half of what
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:24.560]   they should and um then later um when he um was working at a well actually he was going to go to
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.880]   cincinnati and work at a place where they did radioactive um they had radioactive materials
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:36.000]   there he had to take a short course to learn how to be safe in that place we also have to shave off
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.040]   his beard so that he could wear a mask right but um at that time he had to have a physical exam
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:51.520]   so that they would know what his baseline health was uh so that he couldn't sue them later for the
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.280]   damage that he'd received at the plant um and they at that time he learned that his kidneys were a
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:05.120]   quarter of uh functioning and the doctor then said uh you have um in three years you'll need
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:11.600]   dialysis in five years you'll need a transplant he said you're in great health except that you're
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.240]   going to die tomorrow right well if you know you're going to die at least you could be in
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:23.200]   good health until until that happens so he so you and he had an expectation that the the days could
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.760]   be short there was no yes clarity on timing but you had an expectation the days could be short
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:35.040]   yes what did you do we had already been doing all sorts of things diet things one of my girls
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:41.760]   wrote a thing about this and said um almost none of what we did medically was um conventional
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:57.120]   and so um what did we do we prayed uh and it looked like to us that we had been praying all
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:03.200]   along but as time went on we it was obvious that he was getting worse rather than better
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.000]   and that it looked like god was not going to answer our prayers to heal him
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:15.840]   and we considered dialysis and dialysis at that time if you were able to do the in-home dialysis
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:24.480]   which was not a good option for jack for other reasons um in-home dialysis uh would cost thirty
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:30.240]   thousand dollars a year he didn't make thirty thousand dollars a year and he was opposed to
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:39.680]   okay so here it comes political things again he didn't like that um the government was involved
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:47.120]   in certain aspect uh aspects of our life so medical care is one and he didn't want to take
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.000]   from people like the money that had been taken involuntarily from people he did not want to use
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.280]   that for himself for medical things so he didn't want to use a governmental um health plan like
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:07.600]   medicaid right and he didn't we didn't have the money um so uh and he was not willing to enter
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:15.040]   into that and jeopardize the house and the land he wanted that family to be um if he was going to die
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:21.680]   and it looked like he was going to die soon then he didn't want to take make the the go into debt
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.880]   for that right um and he was firmly convinced that god could heal him if he wanted to so he assumed
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.720]   that this was his time to die if these other things were not in place i did ask him um what
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:40.880]   because five people offered him their kidneys for a transplant and he um he wasn't willing to do
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.360]   that because it was going to again cost a lot and i said well jack okay so what if there was somebody
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.160]   who was super rich and they really wanted to donate this money to you and they wouldn't miss
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.920]   it for a transplant what would you think then he said well if that were the case then i'd need to
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:04.480]   consider it i'd need to think about it but now i don't even need to think about it right did um
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   did you did did you and jack consider having private health insurance was he opposed to
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:16.720]   private health insurance or no not private would have been fine and um we had been part of a health
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:24.080]   care sharing ministry before wow and so you go way back right yeah but then um it wasn't until
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:30.160]   after he died that i became part of a health care sharing ministry now with the kids and myself
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:37.360]   right but when you um when jack died he didn't have any life insurance he had no insurance was
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.320]   that something intentional what was did you did he think about did you guys ever think about having
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:49.600]   life insurance um at one point i asked jack so this is going to be kind of from the side on that
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:54.000]   question but at one point i asked jack you know all these people financial counselors say you
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.800]   ought to have savings right you know maybe we should be having a savings thing jack and he said
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:05.520]   and we're never going to need money more than we need it right now that's the challenge so um uh
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:13.200]   no he we he um we didn't have money in the bank to speak of and we didn't have life insurance i
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.400]   don't know that he was opposed to that yeah well one time he probably wouldn't have qualified you
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.480]   know once once he started to develop those types of symptoms he hardly would have qualified for
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.000]   life insurance anyway so i can set your mind at ease yeah no that just but as a long time
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.600]   seller of life insurance it's always i'm always interested to learn you know okay but we did have
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.320]   somebody who was presenting a life insurance policy to us right and when he found out that
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:42.080]   we really hadn't been to doctors to speak of he said oh i might be able to give you get you
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.200]   life insurance you know because there's nothing on record that shows that you have right but we
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.680]   didn't want to do that and we didn't have money for that right absolutely so um you know you make
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.840]   choices yeah and then you live with those choices that you make and i i would guess if jack were
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.000]   sitting here i mean do you think he would regret anything obviously he was a man of conviction
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.720]   and he lived through his convictions right and i i appreciate that i mean that's one of the things
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.560]   that i think we've lost an appreciation for obviously we all have to consider our own path
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.520]   and we have to walk in faith and we're all accountable for our decisions we're accountable
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.640]   to ourselves we're accountable to the lord we're accountable to our family for and each of us has
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:32.480]   to make the decisions but i appreciate um people who are clear on their their convictions their
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:38.640]   conscience and who walk up rightly um without sacrificing those things and i i really appreciate
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:45.280]   that i thought of one more thing there was a chart that i saw and i showed it to jack and it was
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.840]   talking about um the outcome like if you have a kidney transplant and it was showing um
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:42:00.880]   it was a graph and it showed how long people lived after a kidney transplant right what the
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:08.000]   statistics were and if you had one early on before your kidneys were too bad you had a lot better
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.440]   chance of it lasting for quite a long time but on this chart they had cut out all the people who
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.000]   died in the first six weeks after the transplant and they had cut out all the people who had who
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:27.440]   were diabetic also so that they weren't part of this study right and um still the um rate of death
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:33.600]   over not very many years was high right people didn't live a long time even though they'd had
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.800]   not i mean sometimes it does work but this you know um it didn't look good right on there and
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:47.120]   jack was just looking at diminishing returns like you go into terrific debt and no time to pay it
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:57.040]   off and maybe not live that long anyway and beyond um immune suppressants yeah so yeah dealing with
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:06.160]   medical decisions and when you are an intelligent person and you're able to look and to consider
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:13.360]   the medical wisdom for a certain condition you're able to consider medical treatments you're able
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:19.040]   to look at it and you consider conventional medicine um approaches you consider the outcome
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.640]   you consider unconventional medicine approaches it's challenging um because and it's especially
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:32.560]   challenging when you when you have faith in god and his hand in your life because every decision
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:38.320]   has to be measured in in that context and then when you look carefully at the numbers and you
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:43.120]   look carefully at okay what's the percentage of this happening of this treatment providing i think
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:49.200]   almost anybody has a place at which you know certain percentages chances of success and unless
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.800]   you unless your entire operating mindset is the only thing that matters is how many days i live
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:00.240]   on the earth we all have to look at the data and then seek to make a decision in light of it and
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.840]   and one of the things that's most difficult and i appreciate i'm seeking i'm trying to be
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:09.600]   straightforward on the discussion because i think it's worth having but one of the things that's so
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:15.920]   challenging is in hindsight um when you know the outcome right you know the outcome jack's dead
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.240]   when you know the outcome of a situation and now my parents went through this with my own family
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.600]   when my sister died and and then all of a sudden um you are standing there and you have to give an
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:29.520]   accounting of everything that you have done of the medical advice that you have sought of the
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.400]   treatments you've gotten and especially when you bring in religion uh especially those of us who
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:39.600]   may tend more towards kind of a fundamentalist type of of expression or what people would label
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.320]   fundamentalism that has a different um connotation or different denotation depending on you know
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:50.240]   who's using the term but there are some there are a lot of people who are just um i would say
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:58.240]   there are some people who i would say are um irresponsible right and i and um and so we want
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:04.960]   to be very careful not to be irresponsible but there's also different ways of understanding
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.360]   the meaning of responsibility and that's what's so frustrating especially this question we're
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.000]   dealing with some pretty heavy stuff because all of us with our children with our own decisions
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.600]   with our family members we must be responsible we must understand but as you say i mean jack was not
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.280]   a stupid man right so so here's something that jack had to deal with early on in his life and
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:34.640]   this is before i knew him um he had to decide uh he was very bright and he had to decide uh
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:43.200]   what am i gonna live for right and um he decided that he would not try to be a great chemist he
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.960]   would try to be a good chemist but to be a great chemist he would need to devote himself to that
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:55.520]   and he wanted to devote himself to jesus christ there was a point in his life where he realized
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.120]   that he was known for his political views rather than for his beliefs and he changed that too so
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:08.560]   that he didn't um he still had those political beliefs but he didn't tout them as much he didn't
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:16.720]   um that wasn't the lion's share of his attention um and in his life with us he could have made a
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.600]   lot of money and he would have had money to be having life insurance and all that but we wouldn't
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:28.400]   have had him right he wouldn't have been around for the kids and for me for me right so i really
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:35.920]   actually i really appreciate the choices that he made um i just talked with my sister not long ago
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:44.160]   and she was really angry with jack because he um deserted us he left us by dying by dying right and
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.560]   he didn't pursue he was selfish he should have done everything he should have taken care of the
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:54.720]   medical uh he should have pursued the medical things that we have now in modern medicine that
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:02.080]   can help somebody who has kidney trouble to survive and um so um that was one night that
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.000]   she was really she said i'm just still mad at him and the next morning i said okay so would you be
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:15.840]   willing to hear some of our thoughts about that and how we came to that decision and she said yes
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.280]   and so we talked and afterwards she said well i'm not so mad at him anymore but i still disagree with
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.640]   some of the choices he made and i think that that's a legitimate thing everybody has to make choices
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:33.040]   yeah i think we all have probably most of us would look back at some of our choices and and um
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.320]   we make the best choices we know at the time the information we have the decision making is
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.760]   is not easy and um you know my i was talking with a client of mine the other day and we're talking
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:51.280]   about choices and the problem with hard choices is hard joy the hardest the easy choices are
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:58.640]   the easiest choices are always when you have a good option and a lot of bad options those are
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:05.120]   always easy to know the hardest choices are either when you have no good option or you have
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.920]   several good options because choosing among no good options is really hard or choosing among
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:17.200]   several good options is very hard and unfortunately in hindsight it's one thing to look and to say
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.560]   hey you know we may would have made different choice but you may have different information
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:26.320]   which now shows hey certainly is different in 2018 the medical treatment for kidney disease
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:32.240]   may be very different than it was in 1986 or 1996 or 98 or 88 so i want to go back now to
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.920]   the finances and thank you for being willing to talk about i think these are the kinds of
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.600]   decisions and discussions that we wrestle with and all we all have to wrestle with um but i
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:47.440]   appreciate your your being willing to talk about them so um you've told me that before jack died
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.000]   he he he had a sense that he wasn't sure how much longer it was going to be and he called your
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.560]   family together for a family meeting right tell me about that so um he this was for the older kids
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.280]   primarily i don't know if the little kids were involved at all but he talked to the older kids
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:12.960]   and he said um okay so you guys this is what it takes to uh support our family in lean times
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:23.440]   and uh you just now heard my oldest daughter say he said that uh two people working minimum wage
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:31.120]   would support our family so my daughters two of my daughters said daddy we'd like to take that
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:38.400]   job on we would like to work and support the family when you die this was a your eldest was 24
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.800]   or 23 or 24 and then your second one this was not this was your fourth daughter right
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   how old was she at the time about 19 or 20 or so yeah i guess okay and you had two other children
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.880]   in between but they had school and so they said dad we would like to do this one was sick yeah
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:58.240]   right um right so they said that they would like to do that that they would do support the family
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:07.280]   and so he was contented with that he was happy about that great and uh so that was the plan
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:14.480]   and things changed though so he died he died your daughters then did go to go and get jobs and do
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.600]   that or what they did they did now they they didn't know they they both were working one was
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.120]   working for a christian school and one was working for a christian like adventure camp thing and so
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.680]   they they weren't very high paying jobs so they didn't know if they needed they needed to quit
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:40.000]   those jobs and get other jobs but um it worked out fine because what happened was uh right after jack
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:48.240]   died when our friends heard that he had died uh so many people sent money to us just and i have
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.680]   this form that i'm going to share with you later but um so many people sent money to us and then
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:00.560]   after that um monthly there were some people who supported us every month they would send money to
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:07.360]   us and um they just committed to that blessing it was and some of them i didn't even know and
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:13.200]   one of the churches i'd never been to and didn't know those people but they supported us too and
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:20.480]   um and it one time jessica my oldest who was one of the people supporting us um came home to visit
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:27.840]   and she said oh you guys are eating or drinking orange juice you guys are you know i think i'll
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:36.800]   go ahead and buy some shampoo she had really been um living very frugally so that she could give me
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:46.560]   all the money wow so did uh did you didn't say that you know jack was some kind of public preacher
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.520]   it wasn't like you guys had developed a family ministries and established a company and going
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:59.680]   all around trying to to gin up support for yourselves he was just living his life or
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:06.640]   laboring in his family but somehow when he died um these people felt the the desire and the burden to
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:13.440]   to support you okay so yes that's true and and i'll just say too that um okay so our oldest
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:23.520]   daughter just a minute our oldest daughter um was very physically active and socially active
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:31.280]   and wanted to do everything and so um jack kept um supplying her with things so that there were
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.720]   there was a homeschool uh teen group that he formed and there was a track meet that they
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:43.680]   started and there was eventually it ended up being a thing that uh uh he did statewide for
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:50.960]   all the homeschoolers which was um athletics arts and academics um competitions and prizes
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:53:00.800]   and judging and um so he was well known that way and uh he had also uh taught chemistry for the
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.960]   local christian school for the high school there in fact when he was dying he was he just had very
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:13.120]   little energy um he was cutting things out and one of the things i suggested that he cut out was
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:19.920]   teaching that chemistry lab here at our our place and he said oh no that energizes me right now i'm
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.240]   gonna keep doing that so you accounted that when people heard that jack had died and you of course
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:34.720]   were widowed with 12 children oldest 23 or 4 youngest under a year so eight minors yeah so um
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:42.320]   so then you said that people sent money um totaling thousands of dollars yes um and so
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.840]   what did you do what did you do with the money okay so um i think this is where i'm going to
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:58.560]   tell i'm going to read this um paper to you um my oldest uh minor um okay so she was a senior when
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:08.960]   jack died in our homeschool and uh she wanted to go to college but um wasn't emotionally ready for
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:16.720]   that i don't think it's an easy thing to lose your daddy and um and so she took a second senior year
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:25.600]   going to our local christian school and then she wanted to go to wheaton college and uh academically
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:35.680]   she was qualified for that um so we applied for the financial scholarship and uh the form came
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:43.120]   for me to fill out and uh there was there was no blank on there for me to say where my income what
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.400]   my income was so i had to put zero on it so they sent me another form and i still had to put zero
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:52.800]   they had blanked out the places where i might be able to say something so finally they sent me this
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:55:00.880]   form this is verification of low parent income it says since the income which you represent
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:07.200]   reported for 2001 appears unusually low we must verify the information before making a decision
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.240]   on financial assistance for your son or daughter please answer the questions below giving as much
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:18.720]   detailed information as possible so there are six questions one what was your family monthly cost of
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:27.200]   housing in 2001 we own uh oh i said 106 dollars prorated property tax so hold on a second so the
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:33.520]   question is what was your monthly monthly cost of housing and your answer is 106 dollars which is the
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:41.120]   the prorated monthly property tax right right um and i said we own our own home and land
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:50.880]   from what income source was this paid gifts my two daughters seven families and two churches gave us
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:57.520]   monthly money our monthly income averaged about two thousand four hundred dollars what was the
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:04.640]   monthly cost of utilities in 2001 about four hundred dollars i said we have wood heat and that
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:12.560]   helps from what income source were utilities costs paid gifts see above many people did work to bring
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:22.000]   and ready wood for our heating so we paid nothing for that what was the approximate monthly cost of
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:30.560]   food in 2001 about three hundred dollars this includes detergent and others costs uh from what
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:38.640]   income source were food costs paid we were given a pickup load of food 800 pounds of potatoes gift
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:46.000]   certificates for groceries much frozen and canned and fresh food and a half of beef etc our grocery
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.080]   bill was low because of this what was the monthly cost of transportation in 2001 about 365 dollars
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:00.880]   it may have been more averaging out for tires and repairs we own our vehicles from what income
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:07.360]   source were transportation costs paid we paid this with gift money the mechanic also gave us discounts
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:13.280]   did you or your son or daughter receive any other support that was not reported on the
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.840]   FAFSA Wheaton College financial aid application or verification worksheet
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:26.240]   gifts see above also when my husband first died November 2000 there was a great inflow of money
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:34.480]   that was not monthly this came from many people in 2001 we received more than 15 000 from approximately
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:40.320]   45 people or groups who were not the ones who gave to us monthly i used that money to help
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:46.160]   finish our house and for permanent improvements to our place and that's the end of that so that
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:57.920]   was i made this out June 3rd 2002. Wow what a blessing i appreciate being i appreciate people's
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:05.360]   sensitivity to when you know of a need to go and to give money towards it and it's neat to hear
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:12.800]   just the testimony of God's faithfulness i would imagine although you may look back on it and
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.560]   perhaps some of the the fear and the uncertainty may have faded by now but i would imagine that
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:26.640]   as a newly widowed mother there was a lot on your shoulders and there was a before jack died i took
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:36.400]   a walk and i talked heart to heart with God and i said um okay so father you know that jack is
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:41.120]   the organized person in the family he's the one who's the good the teacher he's the one who makes
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:48.880]   the money he's the one who um is practical uh if you take him you know what you're going to be left
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:59.440]   with that's me do you want to do this and um and then i i asked him for several things one i asked
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:07.680]   him for uh his name not to be besmirched because of our decisions and our choices and i also asked
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:14.080]   him if he would make it so that my family didn't have to be involved in our provision right because
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:21.840]   i knew that that would not be a good testimony uh because we were putting our trust in God right and
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:28.400]   they thought we were being kind of stupid to do that right um and he answered those prayers
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:36.640]   yeah no it wasn't easy emotionally emotionally mostly you know and just because i didn't want
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:45.760]   to be responsible well you got a chance to to uh to learn so did you continue homeschooling
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:53.120]   at that time yes yes yes and and i found out about um the widow let's see what is it called
[00:59:53.120 --> 01:00:03.520]   um the widow's curriculum fund which is through the homeschool legal defense hslda yeah um and they
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:14.560]   if you want to continue homeschooling and you're a widow um then um you can tell them what you would
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:23.840]   like to get for your curriculum and if that's something that they think is legit and um you
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:31.840]   have a need then they supply that so they supplied me with curriculum for years and years there came
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:37.120]   a time and this was so much this was really a cool thing because they had been so generous and
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:45.680]   you know i i didn't think that um i didn't think that it was that big a deal to me except that
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:52.400]   every time i received the check to pay for those things i cried because it was such a sweet thing
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:01:01.280]   and that's um they said they supply that money because um people give to that fund um but uh
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.720]   there came a point where i didn't know i had my last child at home and um my finances were changing
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:16.960]   and um i didn't know where i stood and so i applied for the curriculum fund widow's curriculum fund
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:25.120]   and they said you know um you uh are have enough money now that we won't support you and that was
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.360]   such a blessing to me too right when she said that i said oh i have enough money now i don't have to
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:35.840]   worry about this right right so that was really a sweet thing what a blessing did you ever um
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:43.120]   apply for any government uh assistant programs okay that's an interesting thing too um
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:49.760]   so jack didn't like social social security right right and um so uh
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:56.800]   jack didn't like no he didn't like social security and so one time he even wrote the
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:06.880]   social security number uh office the uh administration a letter saying uh i'd like
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.440]   to opt out of this now you can keep all the money i've put in right but i don't want to participate
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.480]   in this anymore and i won't read i won't expect anything and they said well no this isn't a
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:27.120]   voluntary program and he said yeah yeah i guess i knew that right right um but um when um okay so i
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:34.800]   i i talked about what happened um for that first year after jack died after that my parents um
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:42.160]   were in an unhappy situation where my father needed um more care than my mother could give him
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:50.400]   and so i asked if mom uh wanted to move up with him to our place and i'd help her take care of him
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:59.680]   well she financed building a little place on to our big house and um they decided then to
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.080]   so they financed the house and then instead of paying money to the retirement center they gave
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.320]   us the money that they would that they were paying for their housing and stuff yeah it was great
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:19.840]   because we could live on that it's fine right um so um after uh i forgot where i was going you were
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.920]   talking about government programs oh yes yes so after after my mother moved in my siblings and i
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:33.760]   got together and they were uneasy because i didn't have um health insurance and they said and i just
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.080]   want to say that my siblings are the greatest they're just wonderful and they're not greedy
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.280]   people but they were concerned that my mom then would be in a position of wanting to pay for any
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.880]   medical costs that we might have so they said we want you to get some sort of medical insurance
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:55.440]   and that's when i went on the um the health care sharing program that's not insurance but it's
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.600]   something i felt fine about doing and um and they said we also want you to take social security for
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:08.640]   the children that's available for you you ought to be taking it and i i said oh you know i'll
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.760]   seriously consider that let me clarify what they want you to take was the widow and orphans benefit
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:20.640]   from social security which is available to any minor of minor child of somebody who has died
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.320]   while enrolled while fully accredited accredited in the social security program right right so um
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:34.000]   i i had reservations about that but i thought okay if jack had the opportunity to go and take
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.200]   out all that he put in um to the social security administration then he would have liked to take
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:49.440]   so i i i didn't know how that would work but i went ahead and talked to the social security
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:57.920]   person that was local and um she was super helpful and i said um i would like to take out i would
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:04.240]   like to receive it for as long as i'm still taking out money that jack put in i don't want to go past
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.280]   that and so she helped me figure out what he would have put in over all the years that he worked
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.440]   because he he did he paid taxes right he groused about it and then he became convinced that he
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:23.120]   shouldn't be grousing either so he quit grousing but it was glad jack's not here because it sounds
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:31.280]   like we've had a lot of the same struggles so um i began taking um social security and it was it was
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:38.320]   so great it was really nice we we um it just made things looser right and um and then there came and
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:44.400]   the the lady at the social security office that said this isn't how it works you know you just
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:50.320]   keep get keep taking it you know anyway but there came a point where we had reached i had written it
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.920]   down and i kept track of how much money and we had taken out what jack had put in and so i contacted
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:01.360]   her and i said i'd like to quit now and she said it isn't how it works you know you ought to just
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:06.240]   keep on taking and i said no i really want to quit now she said well it isn't that easy i'll have to
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:12.320]   present it to somebody and would you please um show us what money you have that is supporting
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:18.720]   you now so i did that and the board or whoever it was agreed that yes i could go off social security
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:26.560]   and so that was the end of that now my mom upped the the thing after a while she also gave us more
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:34.240]   money um one thing was that she liked her house at 80 degrees right and um so a little higher
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:40.880]   heating bill yes yes so but she um so she supported us generously more than it would have cost her to
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:46.160]   be at a retirement center great well i think that and so fast forward then your parents died
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:52.240]   and you cared for your dad for a while he died quickly and then your mom lived with you for many
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:59.600]   years and she eventually died and now you are living in the the mother or mother-in-law quarters
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.000]   that she paid for that's right and now you get to live with some of your family members right
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.480]   so my oldest daughter and her son and four children live in our big log house that my husband built
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:17.040]   great great her husband and four children um yes um so what a blessing another thing that is
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.240]   and this is just kind of another strange thing that we did besides having um home births we also
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:33.360]   um i'm delighted to say um uh here on our 20 acres we have a burial plot so we had a baby who died
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.320]   and she was buried there and my husband was buried there and my mom and my dad there's a place safe
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:49.040]   for me that's great so that's it's i would um i think that there is in one of the reasons i wanted
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:56.000]   to share your story with my audience is there is a richness in your story that is frequently
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:04.960]   increasingly harder to find in the united states of america um the the decisions and the lifestyle
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:12.560]   that you've described would have been frankly boring uh you know a century ago there's very
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:19.840]   little in what you have described that um a century ago would have been um out of character
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.280]   perhaps instead of teaching all your children at home they may have gone to the local one-room
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:30.320]   schoolhouse or perhaps you um you know instead of jack being able to telecommute he would have had
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.760]   to work locally but beyond that your story would be fairly typical and of course people would their
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   heart their hearts would have gone out to you as a widow um in that era but in our modern era
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:49.520]   your story is very unusual um but yet there is a lot of truth and a lot of lessons in it
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:56.640]   that i think at least for me personally i i take note of and um from my observation we can look up
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:04.160]   here at your wall and i'm looking at a a picture of your your 12 surviving children and how many
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:10.800]   grandchildren now 17 17 grandchildren and um perhaps many more as your younger children um
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:16.560]   continue to marry and have children and do you feel rich i'm rich yeah and i think that's something
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:23.600]   that is lost um you know i have sat as a financial advisor i have sat at kitchen tables like this one
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.640]   with many with with some women some older single women some widowed and divorced women and and
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:37.280]   sometimes the finances um are lean i've i've been in those conversations and i've sought to help
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.760]   those ladies but sometimes the finances are abundant and yet the quality of life is is very
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:50.000]   low and uh i think that jack and i share a lot of um similarities from everything you told me about
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.440]   him in terms of ideology and moral quandaries and trying to figure out how to navigate these things
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:05.280]   and and yet i i think that if he were if he were still here um i i think he would be gratified to
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.440]   see the outcome of his decisions he was clearly a man with vision and he had a vision that went
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:15.920]   beyond just simply the amount of money in the bank account and um uh i i'm encouraged to see that
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.000]   i'm encouraged to see that go ahead i have one more thing and that was i think something that
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:28.560]   we talked about earlier was um that my grandfather uh set up a trust for my parents and for then his
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:34.240]   grand you know his grandchildren and i'm one of those so that that's now what supports me what a
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:43.760]   blessing yeah great so he had some financial um savvy that he exercised and yeah um i i reaped
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:50.480]   the benefit of that it isn't anything that i've done that's smart so well i think that that and
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.440]   i'll i'll share probably more with my audience elsewhere but the but when you have the two
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.400]   things together when you have wise financial planning mixed with instilling values and
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:07.120]   building a family culture that's where a strength is and if you had to choose you know i always
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.920]   looked at this way i remember when i was younger i worked with i worked a lot of of people and
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:18.400]   my wife and i we watched um there's a show on tv um with the the dugger family the the think they
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.320]   had i don't know a lot of kids and counting 17 kids and counting something like that and we watched
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:27.200]   some of those early episodes and i always looked at i always looked at him um and i thought to
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.720]   myself especially in some of the shows we haven't watched it in years but some of the shows where
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.640]   he started was starting to have grandchildren and i thought to myself now there's a man who
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.040]   at this point he's financially well off but i read his book and and they weren't wealthy in
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:45.280]   the beginning but i looked at the wealth that they had in the joy of his life and i said
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.440]   that's a wealthy man and you look at the joy of life and i've done financial planning for so many
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:12:00.800]   people who have plenty of money and they you know they have one estranged child right or um one of
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.840]   the saddest ones i had a friend of mine um a good good friend of mine from the financial planning
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.800]   business was very close to him but he was an older man and he and his wife were very wealthy
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:17.520]   they had one son who committed suicide when he was uh you know 19 20 years old and he had all
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:23.360]   the money in the world to do anything he wanted but the thing he most wanted would have done was
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.920]   of course to have his son back and it's just heartbreaking and to see that and i i came to
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.440]   the conviction i said um i don't think you have to choose love or money i don't think you have to
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.240]   choose and i think that you know i bet jack would agree with that he didn't feel like he had to
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.000]   choose he made a choice at the time to choose to work quarter time to choose to work half time he
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.280]   made choices intentionally and took ownership of them but if you did have to choose right i'd
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:56.400]   help i would a whole lot rather place my wife's future and her support in the hands of my siblings
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.560]   her children i would a whole lot rather trust the family network and that support network i would a
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:09.600]   whole lot rather trust the church than i would you know xyz life insurance company um now i it's my
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.440]   own conviction they can go together many people disagree with me um but but if i had to choose i
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.080]   would do that and that's what i appreciate about your story is you're sharing what that was like
