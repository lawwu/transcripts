[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.200]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.900]   The ultimate verdict on the gospel is not made by its rejecters.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.380]   The ultimate verdict on the gospel is made by those who receive it and demonstrate its
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.440]   truthfulness in their repentance, in their faith, and in the fruit of those things.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.720]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:53.940]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240]   Gospel ministry.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.200]   Sin demands honesty.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.360]   It demands that we tell sinners the whole truth, not part of it, but all of it.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.420]   And this kind of gospel honesty is the only acceptable ministry as far as our Lord is
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.900]   concerned.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.680]   Anything less than this falls short of our calling.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760]   And the truth is, honestly.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.520]   This gospel is not only a gospel of the gospel, but it is a gospel of the gospel.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   It is a gospel of the gospel.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520]   And it is a gospel of the gospel.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   And the truth is, honestly, that the gospel is both glorious and dangerous.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:41.020]   It is eternally enriching, and it is eternally ruining.
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:54.440]   The gospel will escalate pure pleasure forever, or escalate pure pain forever.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.280]   After hearing the gospel.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.980]   After hearing the gospel.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.780]   With a measure of understanding, no sinner is the same.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.740]   No, not in time, and certainly not in eternity.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:18.040]   In the book of Hebrews, the familiar words of chapter 10, all of us know very well.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, we will not be
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   saved."
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   The Bible says that.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the gospel, we
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   will not be saved."
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   The Bible says that.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.040]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the gospel, we
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040]   will not be saved."
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.040]   The Bible says that.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the gospel, we
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.040]   will not be saved."
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.040]   The Bible says that.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the gospel, we
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   will not be saved."
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   The Bible says that.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the gospel, we
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040]   will not be saved."
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040]   The Bible says that.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040]   "For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the gospel, we will
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   not be saved."
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.900]   After receiving the knowledge of gospel truth, then what you should expect is a terrifying
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.160]   judgment.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:04.500]   If you've heard the gospel and reject the gospel, you will have a severer punishment.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.300]   So the gospel leaves no one the same.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.800]   You're either better or worse.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.860]   Not the same.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.900]   Our Lord addresses this in Matthew 11, so let me ask you to turn in your Bible to Matthew
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.800]   chapter 11.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:35.900]   The previous ten chapters of Matthew provide revelation that clearly tells us who He was:
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.560]   the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Messiah, the King, the only Savior, the only
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   Redeemer.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:55.700]   And there's a crescendo at the end of that tenth chapter where He says, "You must receive
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.700]   Me."
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.400]   Then He warns, "Whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny before My Father."
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.660]   And He lays out the reality that there's a price to pay for this, because there will
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.240]   be division in a family.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.320]   He didn't come to bring peace.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   He came to bring a sword.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.280]   He set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.080]   her mother-in-law, and a man's enemies will be the members of his household.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.700]   And then He said, "He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.640]   he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who doesn't take
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.000]   up his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.080]   He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life will for My sake find
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.620]   it."
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.880]   So this is the call at the end of the ten chapters to embrace Him, to embrace Him even
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:03.600]   if it costs you everything, all your relationships and all your life.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.840]   As we come into chapters 11 and 12, we have recorded the responses to these opening ten
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.620]   chapters.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.400]   In the early part of chapter 11, one response is doubt.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.600]   Another response in the early part of chapter 11 is confusion or perplexity.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.000]   And when you come into chapter 12, we find there are a few other responses: superficial
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.600]   amazement, a kind of fascination with miracles, then rejection.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.820]   And then there's the last one, which progresses even to blasphemy.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:59.700]   But in our passage, starting in verse 16, we find the most common form of unbelief.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:12.360]   I suppose we could just sum it up by saying it is a kind of cynical disinterest or indifference.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.300]   After all that has been revealed about our Lord, all that He Himself put on display for
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.080]   the people of Israel, there was doubt, and there was perplexity, and there was amazement,
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.440]   and there was fascination.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:36.280]   But in the end, that nation rejected Him and blasphemed Him and called for His death.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.120]   But for most people, there wasn't that kind of vicious, unrighteous, unrighteous, unrighteous,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.580]   blasphemous hatred of Jesus that showed up in Jerusalem when He was driven to the cross.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:07:01.940]   The most common form of unbelief is just disinterest, indifference.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:10.620]   And our Lord makes that clear, starting in verse 16, in traditional rabbinical fashion.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.880]   He speaks in figurative.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.060]   Figures of speech.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.660]   And so our Lord makes up a story, as He did so often.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.820]   What shall I compare this generation to?
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.160]   What describes this generation best?
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:33.700]   Well, He says it is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to the other
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:41.640]   children and say, "We played the flute for you, and you didn't dance."
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:49.320]   "We sang a dirge," or a funeral song, "and you didn't mourn."
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:08:00.680]   He says this generation is like children, children who are hanging around the open marketplace.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:07.140]   That would be the square in the center of every little village and town where various
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.400]   goods were sold at periodic times during the week.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.220]   The rest of the time it was like the city park, and it was the convenient playground
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.720]   for neighborhood children.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.920]   It's the agora , like a public park, open to everybody when vacant.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.540]   And Jesus sees in this open space little children playing games.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:38.340]   And children's games inevitably mirror adult games, don't they, or adult events, or adult
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.160]   social significance.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.220]   Significant events.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:51.560]   So these children are playing games really designed to follow the two most dramatic events
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:57.520]   in all of social life: a funeral and a wedding.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.820]   Wedding is a glad game.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:07.920]   And so we read that we played the flute for you.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.920]   You didn't dance.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:18.240]   "The wedding game called for a flute and a musical instrument because of joy, and it
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.380]   called for dancing.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:30.980]   They also played the funeral game, and that called for a dirge and mourning; but you didn't
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.220]   follow that.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.140]   You didn't mourn."
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.500]   In both cases, what we see is stubborn indifference.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.300]   How is He applying this?
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:53.080]   Verses 18 and 19: "John came, neither eating nor drinking; he came in funeral mode.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.460]   And they say, 'He has a demon.'
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:02.000]   The Son of Man came eating and drinking; he came in wedding mode.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.260]   And they say, 'Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'"
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260]   "He's a sinner."
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:15.320]   These are peevish children.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:21.020]   Jesus came in a wedding fashion.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.460]   John came in a funeral fashion.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.980]   And His message was repentance.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:33.880]   It was a doomsday message.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.940]   Repent or die.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.020]   He says things like, "Who will be the king?"
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:47.740]   "Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:54.960]   And our Lord says, "You didn't want to enter into John's game.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.320]   You didn't want to be a part of that.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.840]   Rather, you said about him, 'He has a demon.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.160]   He's demon-possessed.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.700]   He's deranged.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.780]   He's a mental case."
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:16.260]   So instead of repentance, there was ridicule.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.260]   On the other hand, Jesus was the very opposite.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:30.540]   His message does touch on the note of repentance, but it's much more that the Messiah is here.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.880]   It's time for joy.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.900]   This is wedding time.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.580]   This is celebration time.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.540]   This is the time of the Messiah.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.700]   This is the time for life and joy.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.080]   But what did they say about Him?
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:56.020]   Verse 19, they said, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.840]   and sinners."
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.640]   So they basically do what sinners always do.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.300]   They create an excuse for their indifference, for their diffidence, for their indifference.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:15.840]   One that justifies them.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.240]   They are too righteous to stoop, to buy the message of John the Baptist.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.060]   He's demon-possessed.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:33.960]   And they are also too righteous to listen to this man named Jesus, because he is sinful.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.060]   He is a glutton and a drunkard and a friend of tax collectors.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.060]   He's a sinner.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.060]   And they are too righteous to listen to this man named Jesus, because he is sinful.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.060]   He is a glutton and a friend of tax collectors and sinners.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   This is sort of the common response to Jesus.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:54.000]   He doesn't come up to my standards.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.660]   Our Lord's immediate response is axiomatic.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.660]   It is a truism.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.120]   It is a self-evident reality.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:07.520]   He says at the bottom of verse 19, "Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds," or as it says
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.580]   in Luke 7:35, "Wisdom is vindicated by her children."
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.700]   What does that mean?
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:24.000]   What it means is true wisdom will show up in what it produces.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.840]   Corrupt human wisdom produces corrupt deeds, such as the very false accusations of the
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.980]   people against John and Jesus.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.280]   But on the other hand, the true wisdom from the people of Israel, the people of Israel,
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:45.920]   from on high, the wisdom that John was preaching and Jesus was preaching, produce righteous
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:54.640]   people who repent and believe; and wisdom is thus vindicated.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.660]   The ultimate verdict on the gospel - listen - the ultimate verdict on the gospel is not
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.440]   made by its rejecters.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.040]   The ultimate verdict on the gospel is made by those who receive it.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:16.380]   And demonstrate its truthfulness in their repentance, in their faith, and in the fruit
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.920]   of those things.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.560]   Impenitent and unbelieving, self-righteous sinners create reasons to reject.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:36.800]   They even mock the gospel, like the peevish children who won't join the game.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:48.280]   Now, when that message is rejected, when that message is refused, as it is most of
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:56.180]   the time - we all know that - what did our Lord do?
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:02.580]   When the message of repentance and faith was rejected, what did He do?
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.100]   Was that disappointing to Him?

[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   He began to denounce the cities.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:24.720]   But He says it with no hesitation at all, no caveat, no explanation, no self-conscious
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:33.260]   fear of contradiction, as if there is some kind of antipathy between sovereign election
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.300]   and human responsibility.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.320]   The Lord gives an invitation.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.760]   Gospel honesty extends mercy.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:53.540]   When it is rejected, gospel honesty warns about the compounding severity of eternal
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:58.100]   judgment on those who hear the truth and reject it.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:10.540]   But it also has a comforting promise we can offer to sinners.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.200]   Sharing the gospel with someone, a loved one, a stranger.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   A coworker.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   A coworker.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   A coworker.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   A coworker.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.380]   Is the greatest gift you will ever give them, even if the thank you in return is rejection
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.220]   of you and Christ.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.720]   However, it's easy to merely give the whole gospel without realizing the impact it will
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.420]   have on a person.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:36.360]   Just as Pastor John just said, exposure to the gospel makes sinners better or it makes
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.720]   them worse.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.140]   It doesn't leave them the same.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.640]   We know that the gospel has enormous power to change lives through Christ.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.880]   But it also has enormous power to heap greater judgment on those who hear it and reject it.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.640]   When we share the gospel with someone, we need to tell them the whole truth in hopes
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.260]   it will cause them to fall on their knees and seek Christ.
