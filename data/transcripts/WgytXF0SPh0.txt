[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   When we're beyond good and evil, you know,
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.900]   and all that's left is the will to power,
[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.880]   then why are we surprised that the powerful rise
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.900]   and that they use the powerless for their purposes?
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.780]   When we forget ideas like equality and rights,
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.040]   which are grounded in God,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.060]   why are we surprised that death camps follow?
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.080]   - The following is a conversation
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080]   with Bishop Robert Barron,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.120]   founder of Word on Fire
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.240]   and one of the greatest educators in the world
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.080]   on the beauty and wisdom within Catholicism,
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.640]   Christianity and religious faith in general.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.600]   To support it,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.600]   And now dear friends, here's Bishop Robert Barron.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   Let's start with the big question.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.000]   Who is God?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.440]   According to Christianity, according to Catholicism,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.400]   who's God?
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.340]   - I'll give you Thomas Aquinas' definition.
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.880]   God is ipsum esse subsistens.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.440]   God is the subsistent act of to be itself.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.160]   Another way to state that in Aquinas
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.920]   is God is that reality, unique, absolutely unique,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.800]   in which essence and existence coincide.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.300]   To be God is to be to be.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.520]   Those are all ways of talking about what we mean by God.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.580]   They are kind of nomic and that's on purpose.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.420]   There's almost a Zen Koan kind of quality
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.680]   about the way we talk about God.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.840]   I'm saying something that's substantive,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.080]   but it's more in like a via negativa mode.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.360]   It's more like what God is not
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.600]   because there's nothing in the world
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.880]   that would correspond to those descriptions.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.840]   So anything in the world would be a being of some type
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.640]   or an event of some type,
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.240]   some particular mode of existence.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.040]   And God is not an entity in the world.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.800]   I would say that's the fundamental mistake
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.480]   that atheists old and new make all the time
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.080]   is they think of God as a big being.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.480]   When Aquinas says that God is not in any genus,
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.160]   even the genus of being,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.280]   it's one of the strangest remarks in the whole tradition,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.620]   but it's really interesting.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.840]   So you say, well, at the very least,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.160]   God must be a being, right?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.080]   And Aquinas' answer is no, he's not in the genus of being.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.480]   So we talk about God being beyond being and so on.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.320]   To say in God essence and existence coincide
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.440]   is to say God's very nature is to be.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.740]   And that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.660]   So what I'm doing there is I'm gesturing
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.120]   the way the tradition does toward God
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.360]   using language that's at the same time
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.320]   philosophically precise and gnomic.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.400]   It's both accurate, it's true.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.720]   God, essence and existence coincide.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.800]   What God is is the same as God's active to be.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.320]   But now what does that mean?
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.760]   I'm not quite sure because nothing
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.800]   in our ordinary experience corresponds to that.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.280]   Everything in our experience is a being of some type.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.980]   So it's existence received according
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.240]   to the mode of some essence.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.460]   That's not true of God.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.180]   Which is why he can't be found in the world.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.200]   And that's, as I say, the fundamental mistake is,
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.780]   oh, I guess theists are those that believe
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.580]   there's this being alongside the other beings
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.420]   in the universe.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.320]   And then atheists say, oh no, there is no such being.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.780]   And that's precisely wrong.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.220]   That's just a category error.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.240]   Dawkins, I think, cites Bertrand Russell
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.760]   to the effect that proving the nonexistence of God
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.660]   is a bit like proving the nonexistence
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.600]   of a China teapot orbiting between Earth and Mars.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.480]   No, that's precisely what God is not,
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.080]   some entity that's sort of hidden
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.920]   among the other entities of the universe.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.120]   God is the reason why there's a contingent realm at all.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.560]   That's the way to put it.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.800]   In more theological language,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.840]   God's the creator of all things.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.880]   So if God is outside of our world,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.600]   is it possible for us to visualize,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.420]   to comprehend, to know God?
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.780]   - Not utterly, of course.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.780]   And I would say our knowledge begins always in this world,
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.420]   begins in ordinary experience.
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.180]   But I think we can, through metaphysical analysis,
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.100]   through philosophical reasoning,
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.340]   can come to some knowledge of a reality
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.560]   which is transcendent to our experience.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.580]   So we gesture toward it.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.140]   I always like Aquinas, who says the language about God
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.140]   that we use is analogical.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.340]   So it's not univocal, meaning what I say about that can
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.580]   or about this bottle, I can say about God.
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.540]   No, that makes God an entity.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.380]   At the same time, it's not simply equivocal.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.580]   So if I say, well, that thing is, and God is,
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.380]   I mean totally different things.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.980]   No, no, I mean something analogous.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.260]   So to be God is to be to be.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.100]   So the real meaning of being is the being of God.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.380]   The being of that thing or this thing,
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.620]   or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.540]   would be analogous to God's manner of being.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.500]   So on that basis, I can make some statements.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.220]   I can theorize.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.280]   And even at the limit, as you suggest, I can visualize.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.140]   So we have metaphors for God.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.300]   And the Bible is replete with those, right?
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.500]   God is a rock.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.420]   God's like a lion.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.100]   God's like this and that.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.180]   The Bible will sometimes imagine God
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.980]   as a human being walking around.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.940]   Now only the crudest fundamentalism would say,
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.140]   well, that's a univocal, accurate description of God.
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.420]   It's an image that's catching something
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.860]   of God's manner of being.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.140]   - Then what does it mean to believe in God?
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.420]   So there's a word, and we'll have to limit ourselves
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.260]   to human interpretable words today.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.380]   There's a word called faith.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.900]   What does faith mean?
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.740]   So if we can't really directly know God,
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.020]   we kind of sneak up to the idea of God with metaphors.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.900]   - Better, he sneaks up on us.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.700]   'Cause I like the language of grace.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.840]   God's action comes first.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.500]   So if I stay perfectly within the realm of I'm seeking
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.620]   with my kind of eagle eyes and my inquiring mind,
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.140]   I'm not gonna find God that way.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.700]   I might find a path that opens up.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.100]   But I would say finally God finds me,
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.980]   and I think then the language of faith
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.280]   begins to make more sense.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.620]   I'm with Paul Tillich, though,
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.620]   the Protestant theologian, said the most misunderstood word
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.860]   in the religious vocabulary is faith.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.860]   Because he said the way we take it, usually,
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.740]   is something subrational.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.300]   You know, I have proof of this.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.880]   I really know this, and I only kind of believe that.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.900]   That's just a personal opinion or impression.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.420]   But that's to identify faith
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.180]   with the kind of infrarational.
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.740]   And that's not it.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.500]   I mean, I don't want something infrarational.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.300]   I don't want superstition or childish credulity.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.500]   So authentic faith is the darkness beyond reason
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.860]   and the far side of reason.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.820]   It's suprarational, not infrarational.
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.060]   And that's a very important move.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.940]   At the limit of what I can know,
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.500]   at the limit of my striving and my vision,
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.900]   there's this horizon that opens up.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.100]   And I think that's true even in ordinary ways of knowing.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.020]   There's kind of a horizon that lures us
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.580]   beyond what I've got.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.340]   Faith has to do more with that kind of darkness,
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.900]   rather than a darkness prior to reason.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.980]   - The darkness beyond the horizon, prior to reason.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.380]   First of all, the poetry of your language is incredible.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.900]   To be, to be.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.260]   I have a million questions.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.500]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.140]   I do too.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.380]   - So first of all, let me just jump around.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.760]   You mentioned to be, to be a few times.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.300]   What does that mean?
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.620]   - Well, to be me is to be a human being, right?
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.740]   To be this is to be a table.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.660]   To be this is to be a microphone.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.940]   So it's, I'll use Aquinas' language.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.400]   It's the act of being poured, if you want,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.140]   into the receptacle of some essential principle.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.380]   So it's got a ontological structure.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.620]   It's an existent, it's a thing that exists,
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.300]   but it's existing in a limited way
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.100]   according to an essential principle.
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.900]   God, what's God?
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.740]   What's God's name?
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.900]   What kind of being is he?
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.660]   We'll go back to Moses now.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.140]   When the Israelites ask me, what's your name?
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.220]   What shall I tell them?
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.160]   And he says, famously, I am who I am.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.660]   But see, Aquinas reads that as a very accurate remark.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.080]   So Moses is wondering, okay, there's a lot of gods,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.740]   and there's a lot of things, a lot of entities.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.580]   Which one are you?
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.260]   You gotta be one of them, so tell me your name.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.260]   In philosophical language, give me the essence
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.460]   that receives your act of existing, right?
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.300]   And God's answer blows the mind of Moses
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.140]   and the whole tradition.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.000]   I am who I am.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.800]   To be God is to be.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.500]   So I'm not this or that.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.340]   I'm not up or down.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.700]   I'm not here or there.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.420]   God is that whose center is everywhere
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.640]   and whose circumference is nowhere, as the mystics put it.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.480]   Now, can I get a clear and distinct idea of that?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.780]   No, and in a way, that's the whole point.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.100]   If I could, I'd be talking about a being of some kind.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.500]   So to be God is to be to be, is to,
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.740]   and that's, you know, Moses, take off your sandals.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.060]   You're on holy ground.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.380]   So I'm gonna go over confidently
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.820]   and find out what this thing is, this burning bush.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.520]   I'm gonna find out.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.940]   No, no, no.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.780]   Take off your shoes.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.380]   You're on holy ground, 'cause you're not in charge here.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.960]   You're not in command, 'cause if you got shoes on,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.220]   you can walk wherever you want.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.940]   You can walk with confidence, but you take your shoes off,
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.020]   you're much more vulnerable.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.720]   And that's appropriate when you're talking about God.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.740]   But here's another interesting,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.900]   I didn't think about the burning bush
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.580]   in this connection before,
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.760]   but it's a bush that's on fire but not consumed.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.500]   Beings are competitive with each other.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.940]   And so these can't be in the same place at the same time,
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.780]   these two beings.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.700]   They're mutually exclusive if you want.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:52.820]   But as God comes close to a creature,
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.780]   he doesn't destroy it or consume it,
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.680]   but the creature becomes more beautiful and more radiant.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.860]   And see, compare it to the classical gods and goddesses.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.620]   When they come bursting into life and experience,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.180]   things are incinerated and people give way
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.740]   and they're overwhelmed.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.700]   Then there's this biblical idea of God comes close
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.080]   and sets things on fire but doesn't burn them up.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.180]   And that's because he's not a competitive being
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.180]   in the world.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.100]   If he were a big being, then he'd be in this,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.700]   he'd be competing for space, so to speak,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.980]   on the same ontological grid.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.200]   But he's not like that.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.840]   So God can come close and we come more fully alive.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.280]   Now we're starting to gesture toward the incarnation,
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.840]   I mean the central Christian doctrine,
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.400]   that God can actually become a human
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.100]   without overwhelming the human he becomes.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.000]   So I mean, that's kind of the next step.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.800]   But the basic idea of God is non-competitively
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.380]   transcendent to the world.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.920]   That's another way to get at it.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   - Non-competitively transcendent to the world,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.720]   so it's beyond being, is the source of being.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.960]   - Right.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.080]   Let me make it maybe more imagistic.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.920]   I think a really good analogy would be author to book.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.120]   Like Tolkien or someone that writes
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.240]   one of these big, sprawling novels.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.540]   And Tolkien's good too 'cause he creates a whole world.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.400]   He creates a new nature, a new language,
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.480]   new history, all that.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.280]   Think of the thousands of characters
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.320]   and the plots and subplots and all of it.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.560]   Tolkien is utterly responsible
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.480]   for every bit of that story, right?
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.120]   Every character, every plot, every subplot,
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.720]   every description, he's completely responsible.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.520]   He's involved in every nook and cranny of it.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.720]   But he's not in the story.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.060]   He's not in the book.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.680]   You're not gonna find him as a character in the book.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.360]   So that's the category mistake of the atheist in a way,
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.520]   is I'm looking for God,
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.840]   he's a character in this story somewhere.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.560]   No, he's the author of the story.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.480]   Mysteriously present to every aspect of the story,
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.720]   but not a character in it.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.880]   - Right, he is deeply in the story somehow.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.580]   He's present, but he's not,
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.920]   even if he is a character, he's not really,
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.040]   the full embodiment is not a character.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.440]   And people inside the book
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.480]   can't really know about the author.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.520]   - Right, no, right.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.760]   Well, see, Augustine says God is simultaneously
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.800]   intimior intimo meo et superior sumo meo.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.240]   He's closer to me than I am to myself,
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.320]   and he's higher than anything I could possibly imagine
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.360]   at the same time.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.420]   But see, once you get the insight
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.880]   that God is the sheer act of to be,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.200]   well, of course that's true.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   So right now, God is sustaining us in existence, true.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.380]   Aquinas says God is in all things
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.400]   by essence, presence, and power, and most intimately so.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.720]   And he's nowhere in this room.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.080]   Okay, well, where's God?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.640]   He's nowhere in this room.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.080]   He's totaliter aliter, we say.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.920]   He's totally other, same time.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.800]   But once you crack that code, though,
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.440]   I think you see it, of why that would be true.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.160]   And see, now I'm getting from more philosophical language
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.200]   to more mystical language,
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   'cause all the mystics talk that way
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.720]   in these high paradoxes about God's availability
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.640]   and unavailability.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.020]   I've often thought in the Bible,
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.400]   story after story, God can neither be grasped
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   nor hidden from.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.920]   So the first sinful instinct is to grasp at God's.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.280]   I've got him, I understand him, I can manipulate him.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.660]   No, no, no, story after story is told you can't do that.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.400]   Well, then the other extreme of the sinner,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.440]   all right, then I'm gonna run from God.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.840]   I'm gonna avoid God.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.400]   Jonah and the whale, you know,
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.960]   so he has the call from God,
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.720]   and he said, no, no, I'm gonna refuse that.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.340]   I'm gonna run as far away.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.360]   I'm gonna go to Tarshish,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.900]   which meant like Timbuktu for them,
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.100]   at the end of the world.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.860]   God's got the whale, swallows him up,
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.820]   and brings him right back where God wants him.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.540]   It's a poetic way of saying
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.840]   you can't escape the press of God.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.460]   At the same time, Tower of Babel,
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.980]   I'm gonna build a tower up to God.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.100]   I'm gonna grab hold of God.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.880]   No, no, no, you can't do that either.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.400]   So live in the space in between those two things,
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.180]   which would be the space of friendship with God,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.720]   falling in love with God,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.840]   is neither grasping nor hiding from God.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.660]   - You mentioned, again, a lot of beautiful poetic things.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.340]   You mentioned grace.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.180]   - Yeah.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.300]   - You mentioned sin.
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.180]   You mentioned incarnation.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.500]   Is there a philosophical, pragmatic way
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.700]   to start talking about the pillars of Christianity?
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.700]   What are the defining things that make Christianity to you,
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.060]   and broadly speaking, to those that follow the religion?
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.320]   - In a way, what we've done so far
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.120]   is a necessary propedutic,
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.880]   because we're talking about God.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.080]   What makes Christianity distinctive, of course,
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.840]   is the claim of the incarnation.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.320]   So we come up out of Judaism.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.080]   We come up out of this great monotheistic tradition.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.060]   And the Bible itself, and all the great commentators
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.360]   within Judaism, I think, would agree
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.440]   with this basic theistic stuff that I've been talking about,
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.400]   take Moses Maimonides, for example.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.860]   Now, what makes Christianity distinct?
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.760]   This supremely weird claim that God becomes one of us.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.520]   God becomes a creature, but without ceasing to be God,
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.000]   and without overwhelming the integrity
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.480]   of the creature he becomes.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.280]   What we see in the burning bush,
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.900]   that principle which obtains across the board.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.400]   So the closer God comes to me,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.100]   the more radiant I become, right?
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.580]   But take that now to the nth degree,
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.820]   would be what we mean by the incarnation, the incarnation,
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.440]   of the Son of God becoming a creature
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.220]   in such a way as to make humanity radiant and beautiful.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.800]   That's the pillar of Christianity.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.300]   It's the incarnation.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.000]   And what follows from that is the redemption
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.200]   of all of reality.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   So not just of human beings, but in becoming a creature,
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.060]   God divinizes the world.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.500]   The Greek fathers always said God became human,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.400]   that humans might become God.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.460]   And that's a good way to sum up, I think,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.180]   the essence of Christianity.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.020]   - Why is this such an important thing?
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.780]   So it's a distinctive thing,
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.940]   but why is it so important philosophically
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.900]   to what it means to be a Christian?
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.940]   What impact did that have on our world,
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.420]   on human civilization, on human nature,
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.260]   on our morals of why live, what to live for,
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.440]   and the meaning of it all?
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.400]   Why is incarnation so important?
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.000]   - Well, I think it's massively important
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.860]   because it's the divinization principle,
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.280]   that God wants to divinize his creation
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.180]   and sort of in this concentrated point of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.440]   But then we talk about the mystical body of Jesus,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.160]   so that goes right back to Paul.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.120]   As we're grafted onto Christ,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.320]   we talk about that as the church,
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.360]   we become like cells and molecules in an organism.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.400]   That's the church, it's not an organization.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.940]   That's a deformation of ecclesiology.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.000]   The church is this organism that begins with Jesus,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.720]   and then he's drawing all of humanity,
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   but ultimately all of nature, all of creation to himself.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.540]   When the Son of Man is lifted up,
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.380]   he will draw all things to himself,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.380]   that idea of the gathering in of a scattered creation.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.300]   So in that way, it's at the heart of it.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.580]   Then there's all kinds of things.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.620]   If God becomes human,
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.380]   that means there's a dignity to humanity
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.880]   which goes beyond anything any humanist
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.400]   of any stripe has ever said, right?
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.160]   Ancient, medieval, modern, contemporary.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.000]   Christianity is the greatest humanism imaginable.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.740]   God became one of us in order to divinize us.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.380]   The goal of my life is not just to be a good person,
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.660]   not just to be materially successful,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.380]   not just to be a member of society.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.120]   The goal of my life is to become a participant
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.340]   in the divine nature.
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.580]   And so I don't think there is a humanism
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.920]   greater than that, even conceivably.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.580]   So that's where I think humanism
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.300]   is profoundly influenced by the incarnation.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:25.100]   And just our notion of God as non-competitive to us.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.580]   That's so important 'cause I think it's so many systems
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.460]   from mythology onward,
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.900]   you have these competitive understandings of God.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.620]   When Jesus says to his disciples the night before he dies,
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.180]   I no longer call you servants but friends,
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.260]   that's an extraordinary moment.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.620]   Because every God who's ever been served,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.580]   well that's the best we can hope for,
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.700]   is that we'll be the servant of God.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.540]   I've tried to obey you, Lord, I'll try to do what you want.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.860]   But when Jesus says, I no longer call you servants
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.260]   or slaves, he would have said in the Greek there.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.460]   But friends, I don't know,
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.380]   I can't imagine anything greater than that,
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.860]   becoming God's friend.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.620]   - That's a call to become one with God.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.140]   It's possible to become one with God.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.660]   Now I should mention, you're one of the greatest
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.940]   religious communicators I've ever experienced.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.900]   A lot of, a huge number of people are fans of yours.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.260]   You've done a lot of great conversations,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.900]   you've done Reddit AMAs, which is a very unique,
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.800]   bold, brave thing.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.880]   And on one of them, somebody asked,
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.100]   what's the most challenging of the seven deadly sins?
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.060]   So first, what are the seven deadly sins?
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.620]   What do they have to do with Christianity?
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.780]   How essential, how crucial they are to the religion?
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.580]   And what's the most challenging in our modern day?
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.580]   - Yeah, to name 'em, pride, envy, anger, sloth,
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.220]   avarice, gluttony, and lust are the seven deadly sins.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.940]   We're called capital sins sometimes, from Copeland.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.380]   They're the head sins from which things tend to flow.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.760]   The most fundamental is pride.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.420]   Probably most people today, if you talk about vice,
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.820]   or you talk about a deadly sin, they would think about lust.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.020]   But the classical authors, including Dante,
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.580]   who does this pictorially, that's the least
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.180]   of the deadly sins, is lust, 'cause it's the one
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.540]   that's most sort of dependent upon the body
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.140]   and its passions and so on.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.620]   The most important is pride.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.000]   Pride is the deadliest of deadly sins.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.920]   And it's very simple to see why.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.340]   Pride is the, Augustine calls it, in curvatus in se.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.900]   I'm caved in around myself.
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.300]   Like a black hole, right, to get into the scientific.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.660]   But the black hole to me is a great symbol.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.100]   You know, that it's so heavy that it draws everything,
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.700]   including light, nothing can escape from it.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.700]   See, that's the sinner, we're all sinners.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.700]   We're like black holes, that we draw
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.320]   everything into ourselves.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.800]   So as a sinner, and you know, I'll confess I'm a sinner,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.240]   the temptation is, okay, this is the Bishop Barron moment,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.380]   and I'm drawing you now into my world and so on.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:18.920]   What that does is it kills us off, and it darkens life,
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.420]   and it makes it small and heavy and awful, right?
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.360]   It's like, but see, compared to the contrasting thing,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.380]   is when you're lost in a moment,
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.800]   you're not concerned about the impression I'm making,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.920]   you're not concerned about drawing the world into yourself,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.220]   you're not concerned about this monkey on my back
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.600]   that's always telling me, you know,
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   look good and sound right.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.080]   But you're lost in something.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.320]   You're just talking, you know, to a friend,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.000]   and the two of you together are discovering something true
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.440]   or beautiful, or you're lost in a movie,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.020]   or you're lost in a book.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.860]   Those are the best moments in life.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.700]   Those are the best,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.420]   those are the least prideful moments, right?
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.700]   That's when the light comes out.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.220]   I become radiant because I'm overcoming this tendency
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.620]   to fall in on myself.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.780]   Dante is so good because the way he pictures Satan
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.240]   in Divine Comedy, and you know,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.700]   he's at the center of the earth,
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.260]   so like a black hole that way,
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.060]   he's at the center of gravity, he's at the heaviest place.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.940]   And there's not fire where he is, but ice,
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.180]   it's a much, much better image
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.060]   that you're frozen in place and you're stuck.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.420]   And he's got wings, right?
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.680]   And they used to be angel wings 'cause he's an angel,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.460]   but now they're like bat wings for Dante.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.380]   And they're flapping.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.500]   And all they're doing is making the world around him colder
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.300]   because he's ice, he's stuck in his own iciness.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.620]   And then he's beating his wings over the ice
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.900]   and making everyone else colder.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.820]   It's a great image.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.260]   And then he has, this is cool too,
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.020]   he has three faces, Satan,
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.100]   because he's the simulacrum of the Trinity.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.100]   So every sinner thinks he's God.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.460]   So I pretend I'm God.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.380]   So he's got the three faces.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.400]   And from all six eyes, he weeps.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.180]   Also from all three mouths, he's chewing a sinner.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.260]   He's got Cassius, Brutus, and Judas in the three mouths,
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.980]   you know, the three traitors.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.380]   But I thought, it's just a great image
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.440]   of all of us sinners is we're stuck,
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.180]   it's heavy, it's cold,
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.020]   we're chewing on our past resentments,
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.100]   we're weeping in our sadness,
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.220]   and we're making the world around us colder.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.340]   It's beautiful, it's great.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.540]   So that's pride.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.140]   See, that's an image of pride
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.500]   'cause Satan, that's his great sin, pride,
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.220]   which is why he needed Michael, right, Mikael,
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.380]   who's like God.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.980]   So the great challenge to him,
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.460]   which we need all the time,
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.380]   is someone to say, wait a minute, wait a minute,
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.940]   you're not God.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.900]   But the minute we say, I'm God,
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.640]   black hole, I now cave in on myself.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.900]   I suck everything into myself,
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.580]   and I turn into Dante's Satan.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.880]   So that's a great image.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.720]   That's pride.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.620]   That's the most fundamental.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.840]   That's the uber capital sin.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.200]   It's all the other ones flow from that, in a way.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.160]   - So in general, empathy, humility, compassion,
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.680]   love thy neighbor is the way to fight the sin of pride.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.960]   - Right, which is why the masters tend to say,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.640]   this was Bernard, Saint Bernard,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.120]   was asked, what are the three most important virtues?
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.640]   And he said, humilitas, humilitas, and humilitas,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.400]   because it's the opposite of pride.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.800]   But they're bringing Aquinas in again,
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.200]   'cause we think, humility, I'm no good.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.380]   That's not what it means at all.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.480]   It means what I was describing before,
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.760]   when you're just lost in something.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.000]   You're just lost in it.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.920]   My image, I live out in Santa Barbara,
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.200]   and I like to walk on the beach out there,
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.620]   and there's a section of the beach
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.520]   where they let the dogs run free without leashes.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.640]   And when you see a dog, and he's well cared for,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.840]   and his master's right there,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.120]   and the master's throwing the tennis ball into the surf,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.000]   and the dog goes galloping out into the surf,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.960]   and he gets it with a big smile, and comes running back,
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.440]   that's humility, that's an image of heaven,
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.920]   because he's just lost in that moment.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.880]   He doesn't care about impressing anybody,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.640]   he doesn't care about what people think of him.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.400]   He's just lost in it.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.520]   That's it, that's heaven, right?
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.840]   And those moments in our life, when we get that,
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.120]   it's a little hint of paradise.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.880]   But the trouble is, most of us live, frankly,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   most of the time, in various levels of hell,
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.920]   and we're dealing with these deadly sins.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.520]   Like, envy flows from pride, because if I'm prideful,
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.480]   I'm a black hole, I'm in Kravatov's Sensei,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.520]   I'm collapsed in, what am I really
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.800]   gonna be concerned about?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.160]   That guy's getting more attention than I am.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.320]   That guy's richer than I am.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.520]   That lady, she's got a bigger reputation than I do,
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.320]   and why don't I have that?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.240]   So envy is a very close daughter of pride.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.000]   Anger flows from there.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.520]   Why do I get angry?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.000]   The dog isn't getting angry on the beach
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.720]   when he's running after the tennis ball.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.680]   But I get angry all the time, sputter with anger
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.000]   when things aren't going my way,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.640]   and you're insulting me, and you're not doing what I want,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.680]   and I'm being hurt, my reputation.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.720]   So anger flows from pride.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.280]   All of them do, all of the deadly sins do.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.840]   - So, you said, "I'm a sinner."
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.360]   So we're all sinners.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.200]   - Yeah.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.240]   - And you mentioned Satan.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.720]   Where's the, so there's heaven and hell,
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.440]   there's God and Satan.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.880]   Where's the line between what it means to be good
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.440]   and not good enough?
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.200]   Or, I hesitate to use the word sort of evil,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.040]   but maybe overwhelmingly sinful.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.520]   Where's the line between hell and heaven?
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.120]   - Think of them as limit concepts, maybe.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.040]   They're like heuristic devices.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.600]   So heaven would name this ultimate friendship with God.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.720]   So think of the dog on the beach,
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.120]   who is just, he's fallen in love with his environment,
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.680]   with his master, with the surf.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.280]   He's just lost in it, right?
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.400]   He's forgotten himself, he's transcended himself,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.720]   and is now lost in the wonder of the beauty of that place.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.480]   Now, imagine the limit of that is the friendship with God
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.160]   that we talked about, that I become the friend of God.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.080]   I become so forgetful of myself,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.240]   so lost in the beauty and truth and goodness of God
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.960]   that I found beatitudo, right?
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.200]   I found joy, the beatific vision, we call it.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.400]   That's the limit case, that's where we're tending,
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.200]   that's where God wants us to go.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.160]   Think of hell as a limit case in the opposite direction.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.480]   That's curvatus in se, that's the black hole.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.780]   And we're all sinners,
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.920]   meaning we're somewhere on that spectrum.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.200]   We have good days and bad days,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.760]   and we have good moments and bad moments,
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.980]   and I can be drawn toward sin.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.280]   What's God's purpose, and Christianity's reading,
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.440]   is to bring us out of that.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.640]   Now, where did he go?
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.360]   He went all the way into it to get us out of it.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.800]   It's like pulling a sock back out.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.240]   Sock's inside out, you have to go all the way in
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.280]   and pull it back out.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.860]   And so God had to go all the way down.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.160]   And there's the trajectory of the incarnation.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.840]   Though he was in the form of God, and this is St. Paul,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.360]   Jesus did not deem equality with God
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.080]   a thing to be grasped at, but rather emptied himself
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.520]   and took the form of a slave,
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.360]   being born in the likeness of men.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.940]   But then he was known to be of human estate,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.360]   and he accepted even death, death on a cross.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.480]   And so Paul imagines that the incarnation
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.480]   is this downward journey.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.920]   In order to get all of us, all of us who were stuck,
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.760]   were stuck in our sin.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.160]   And so again, Paul says he became sin on the cross.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.560]   It's a really, really powerful idea.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.360]   He wasn't a sinner, 'cause then he'd need to be saved too.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.320]   He's not a sinner, but he entered into our dysfunction
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.620]   in order to pull us back out of it.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.080]   - So that's a really powerful message, an embodiment,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.020]   sort of educating the world about sin.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:11.000]   That said, day to day, there's like oscillations
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.540]   in terms of how much each human sins,
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.920]   and there's a struggle against that.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.920]   So that dog that loses himself on the beach
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.000]   may have had a lot of sex with other dogs
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.960]   leading up to that.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.480]   May have been not the best dog he could be
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.560]   leading up to that.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.600]   So how, if it's a math equation,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.800]   what does the final calculation look like
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.960]   in terms of ending up in heaven?
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.600]   What does it mean to live a good life in the end?
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   Is it the average amount of sin you do is low?
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.400]   Are you allowed to make mistakes?
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.880]   - Yeah, the metric is love, right?
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.360]   And love is not a feeling.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.840]   It's an act of the will.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.540]   To will the good of the other.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.480]   That's Aquinas again.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.800]   To will the good of the other as other.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.480]   You see, that's the anti-black hole principle.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.320]   When I--
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.240]   - Will the good of the other as other.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.360]   - See, 'cause if I'm willing your good
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.980]   because it's good for me,
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.200]   so it's good for you that I'm on this program, I guess.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.100]   I'm willing your good,
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.660]   but that's 'cause it's gonna be down to my benefit.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.920]   That's just an indirect egotism.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.480]   That's why I see love is really rare and strange,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.480]   that I really want what's good for you as other.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.840]   So not connected to the black hole tendency
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.720]   of my own prideful ego.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.920]   When I've broken that, I've forgotten self,
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.000]   and I've moved into the space of your own good.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.200]   That's what love is.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.680]   Now, God wants us to be,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.760]   by this they will know that you're my disciples,
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.480]   that you love one another, Jesus says.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.200]   So that's it.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.160]   Now, I mean, life is ups and downs and back and forth,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.960]   and we're better or worse at that.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.480]   The point of a church is to graft us onto Christ,
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.120]   that we might become more and more conformed to love.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.280]   But the final calculus, I'll leave that to God.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.800]   But use love as the metric.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.640]   At the end of the day, when you examine your conscience,
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.880]   did I will the good of the other today?
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.360]   How effective was I at that?
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.200]   And be, just like Ignatius of Loyola, be brutally honest.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.620]   Or was I just willing someone's good
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.960]   because it was good for me?
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.320]   Where were those moments
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.240]   where I was like the dog on the beach?
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.680]   And then see, play it the way,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.480]   not so much God the lawgiver surveying,
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.660]   and you did three of those and four.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.120]   It's God wants us to be fully alive.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.020]   Saint Irenaeus is one of my great heroes,
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.080]   ancient, patristic figure.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.340]   And his famous line is, "Gloria Dei Homo Vivens."
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.760]   The glory of God is a human being fully alive.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.580]   See, and that gets us over this sort of obsession
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.820]   with the legalism and did I do enough?
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.120]   And is that, that's a big enough sin?
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.240]   God wants us fully alive.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.680]   The key to that is willing the good of the other.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.900]   He died that we might come
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.720]   to a richer appropriation of that.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   - So to be fully alive is to be in love with the world,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.940]   or to love the world deeply.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.880]   And what love means is the other.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.160]   Is-- - Get out of yourself.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.680]   - Right. - It's the humility,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.080]   yeah, getting out of yourself.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.600]   - Let go. - But that somehow is not,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.360]   that's not even selfless,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.480]   because the word selfless requires there to be a self.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.160]   It's almost like just letting go.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.040]   - Yeah, I might talk about like a gift of self,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.900]   that you're self-aware, but you give a gift of yourself.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.720]   Your self becomes not a magnet drawing things into itself,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   but it becomes a radiant source of life for others.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.440]   I think Mother Teresa would have had a keen sense
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.680]   of herself, it seems to me,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:57.000]   but it was to light other people up
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.800]   so that they might be radiant.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.880]   You know, that's the game.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.960]   So you probably articulate it that way too.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.520]   - Yeah, I love love.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.360]   It's such an interesting thing.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.600]   - But we have to be hard-nosed about it.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.400]   Like your friend Dostoevsky,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.720]   love is a harsh and dreadful thing.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.000]   It's not a feeling.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.080]   And our culture is so sentimentalized love,
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.980]   that it's having warm feelings or doing what people want.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.820]   And that's not it at all.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.480]   Love is always correlated to the order of the good.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.360]   'Cause if I'm willing the good of the other,
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.620]   I have to know what that good is.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.240]   So a parent that says, "Oh, I'll give the kid
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.280]   "whatever she wants," well, that's not love.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.480]   That's indulgence or that's sentimentality.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.880]   But I have to know what the goods really are
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.880]   if I'm gonna will them for you.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.960]   - Yeah, in some sense, you're absolutely right.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:47.360]   A component of love is the struggle to know the other.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.600]   It's the struggle to understand.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.100]   I mean, that's what I mean by empathy.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.100]   It's not Valentine's Day romantic gifts.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.660]   It's a struggle.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.520]   It's like trying to understand,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.420]   trying to perturb your own mind
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.840]   and that of another human being
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.500]   to try to figure out who they are, what they want,
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.540]   what makes them happy, what are they afraid of,
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.300]   what are they hoping for?
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.580]   And it's like a dance, a dance of conversation.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.660]   A dance of just shared experiences
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.580]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.540]   And all of that requires for you to be,
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:31.260]   I guess, yeah, empathize.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.860]   Imagine yourself in their place
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.180]   and then love that person
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.860]   when you're living inside that person.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.740]   - Yeah.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.720]   Several minutes ago about the pillars of Christianity.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.500]   So we talked about God, we talked about incarnation,
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.560]   but you're getting now to a third key one,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.500]   namely the Trinity, because we're monotheists, right?
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.860]   But we don't think God is monolithically one.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.340]   We think God is a play of persons.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.740]   And the father from all eternity
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:07.180]   by a great mental act forms his interior word,
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.780]   as Aquinas puts it.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.020]   And that's the logos, right?
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.980]   That's the verbum, that's the word
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.340]   by which the father knows himself.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.740]   And we call it the son.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.060]   So the imago, it's the image of the father.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.480]   But then see, the great thing is that imago
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.880]   is not like just a dead image on a mirror
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.160]   or a dead image at a pond or something.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.160]   It's a full reflection of the father's being.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.920]   He's one in being with the father.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.280]   Therefore, the son has everything the father has
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.800]   except being the father.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.160]   But that means that the two of them look at each other
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.880]   and they're just crazy in love with each other
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.320]   because the father's the fullness of being,
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.100]   the son is the fullness of being.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.100]   And they're so crazy in love with each other
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.460]   that they, this is Fulton Sheen put it this way,
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.900]   that there's this (sighs)
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.500]   they just, they love each other with this sigh.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.180]   And we call that the spiritus sanctus.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.460]   That's the holy breath, right?
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:06.100]   The holy sigh of love between the father and the son.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.540]   And that's one being, one essence we say of God.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.220]   But in these three persons, but all your language
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.800]   about like dance and play and community,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.740]   the Greek fathers talked about perichoresis,
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.440]   which means God, the three persons
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.140]   kind of sit in a choir together.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:27.780]   So they sing together, you know?
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.240]   And that's why see, Christianity is unique in this claim
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.800]   that God is love.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.040]   So every religion will say God loves in some way.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.360]   Love is an attribute of God.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.160]   God is, or love is a thing that God does sometimes.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.260]   But Christianity is unique in all the religions
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.700]   in saying that God is love.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.020]   - And somehow the Holy Trinity embodies that idea.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.660]   I mean, that philosophically has always been confusing to me
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.940]   what it means to be three things
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.680]   and at the same time be one God,
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.820]   the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.540]   What is this dance between these three?
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.500]   What exactly, like how do you visualize,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.980]   how do you understand this?
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.820]   - Yeah.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:20.140]   - This very fascinating, essential thing for Christianity.
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.500]   - The first thing I'd say is what we already
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.460]   have been sort of talking about,
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.180]   is if you say God is love, and most people probably say,
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.260]   yeah, I like that, that's a good idea, God is love.
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.960]   But it's very peculiar because if he is love,
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:35.260]   there has to be in his unity a lover,
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.620]   a beloved, and the love that they share.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.340]   Otherwise he isn't love by his very essence.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.940]   He would love, it would be an attribute of God
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.780]   or an action of God, but if it's his very nature,
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.780]   there has to be lover, beloved, and love shared.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.540]   And the tradition eventually came to see that.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.220]   The image I was using before of the Father,
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:00.220]   his imago, the Son, well that's born of God's infinite mind.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.260]   So of course God has an image of himself.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.100]   Heck, I've got an image of myself.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.100]   That's something I can pull off as a puny little creature.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.460]   God in his infinity has a perfect imago of himself.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.520]   And they have to fall in love with each other.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.900]   What else can they do?
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.860]   Because they're in the presence of infinite good.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.800]   And so it has to follow that you then have
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.840]   the shared love that connects them.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.460]   And that's how we generate, if you want,
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.900]   this idea of the three persons in God.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.740]   - Let me ask you about the church.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.580]   - Yeah.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.020]   - One of the defining characteristics of Catholicism
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.980]   is the Catholic church.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   - Yeah.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.740]   - What is the Catholic church?
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.020]   - I would say it's the mystical body of Jesus.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.320]   So as I said before, it's not an organization.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.780]   If we do it that way, we're gonna miss it.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.860]   It's got organizational elements to it.
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.940]   So I'm a bishop, I'm a office holder within the church.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.900]   But the church is an organism, not an organization.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.300]   So it's a organism of interconnected cells, as I said,
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.880]   namely all of the baptized, gathered around Christ
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.580]   in a mystical union.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.900]   That's the church.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.380]   - But there's buildings, there's titles.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.220]   - Sure.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.180]   Because it manifests itself institutionally then.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.140]   - So are the sort of heavy things about that
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.860]   all have to do with pride?
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.700]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.500]   - The sexiness of the buildings.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.260]   - Yeah, no, whatever's corrupt in the church,
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.620]   of course it comes from pride, from sin.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.900]   And one thing I like about, you know,
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.620]   the New Testament is so clear on that.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.220]   I mean, Paul is in his little tiny communities.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.020]   So before there was a Vatican or dioceses or anything,
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.460]   Paul is in his little tiny communities.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.860]   So Christians like in Corinth and Ephesus, you know.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.020]   What's the one thing we know about them?
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.740]   Is they fought with each other.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.300]   'Cause Paul's always upbraiding them and telling them,
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.260]   "Come on, would you people get it together?
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.340]   "And who's bewitched you?"
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.180]   And so from the beginning, we've been fighting
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.060]   with each other because we're made up of sinners.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:59.020]   And, you know, so one thing we do in Catholic ecclesiology
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.980]   is the official name for the study of the church
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.680]   is to talk about the treasure and earthen vessels.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.880]   Paul's language again.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.020]   The treasure is Christ.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:11.100]   The treasure is the love he's bequeathed to the world.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.780]   That's the treasure that we have.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.420]   But it's always held in these really fragile vessels,
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.740]   namely us.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.060]   And so it's gonna be marked by corruption and stupidity
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.260]   and pride and everything else.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.900]   - Well, nevertheless, there's a hierarchy.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.760]   There's titles and so on.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.920]   If we remove pride from the picture,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.940]   so the best possible interpretation of the hierarchy
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.280]   that makes up this one organism, this living organism,
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.840]   what's the role of the pope, for example?
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.280]   What is the role of a bishop, for example?
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.200]   Like, what is the role of the hierarchy
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.920]   in terms of the broader vision of Christianity,
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.560]   Catholicism as a religion?
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.920]   - I'm a devotee of this guy named Johann Adolf Mueller,
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.600]   who was a theologian early part of the 19th century.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.440]   And he was part of the kind of romantic movement.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.460]   And he said the purpose of the pope
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.900]   is to symbolize and embody and draw together
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.740]   the unity of the entire church.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.060]   So he's the personal symbol of the unity of the church.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.080]   Who's a bishop?
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.280]   The bishop is the personal symbol
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.500]   of the unity of a diocese.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.940]   Who's a pastor of a parish?
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.440]   He's the personal symbol of the unity of that parish.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.380]   So he understood it not so much organizationally
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.540]   as organically, again.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:31.600]   It was like, what, that around which
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.360]   the pattern organizes itself.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.400]   And if you don't have that unifying figure,
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.320]   the community will kind of separate.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.480]   And you see that all the time.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.080]   Without headship, we would say.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.160]   So it's more symbolic and organic
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.480]   than it is organizational.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.020]   - So symbols for community.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.960]   But there's such fascinating peculiarities
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.360]   to each individual symbol.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.680]   There's different characteristics
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.780]   that make up the different people.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.320]   They have different ways of communicating.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.740]   They have different hopes and fears
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.080]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.240]   What, if they're all symbols,
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.580]   what's the role of the different peculiarities
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.860]   of those symbols?
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.120]   Of being an inspiring uniter
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.740]   versus maybe a stronger type of
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.840]   more judgmental kind of communicator,
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.880]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.400]   Can you maybe speak to the human part
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.160]   of these symbols?
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.920]   - Yeah, well, I might just shift
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.180]   to another image of shepherd.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.040]   So that's a classic biblical image.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.400]   And as a bishop, I walk around
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.440]   with this thing called a crozier,
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.040]   which is a shepherd's staff.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.880]   So it's the symbol of the bishop's office.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.400]   And the crozier, though, is a kind of
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.760]   in-your-face thing in a way.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.560]   'Cause it's got, the end of it
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.040]   was meant to hold off wild animals.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.440]   And then the crook part of it
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.360]   was meant to bring sheep back to the fold.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.200]   So I walk in with that,
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.120]   "Oh, this is nice, look at the bishop coming in."
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.840]   But that's a kind of in-your-face symbol
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.960]   that I'm here to defend the church against predators,
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.080]   and I'm also here to draw people in
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.900]   who are wandering too far away.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:15.800]   So that's okay.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.400]   I mean, that's part of the role
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.800]   of the hierarchy and the pope
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.280]   and bishops and pastors.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.880]   Pastor just means shepherd, right?
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.120]   So I'm the shepherd of a parish.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:25.960]   So that's okay.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.920]   It's not like just all sunshine and light
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.840]   and what a pretty image.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.320]   The one who embodies the unity of the community
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.520]   is also the shepherd.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.960]   - Okay, but again, leaning on the human thing.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.000]   The church is an institution.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.040]   And I don't know if you've heard,
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.920]   but there is an element of power that corrupts.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.240]   And absolute power corrupts absolutely,
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.520]   as the old saying goes. - More than that goes.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.920]   - Let me ask you something else
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.280]   that came up on the Reddit AMA.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.120]   - Yeah.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.480]   - Mega churches and the prosperity gospel.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.640]   - Yeah. - And you've mentioned
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.840]   that you may not be a fan.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.120]   What are your views on this?
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.200]   And what are your views in general of money and power
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.880]   corrupting the heads of these institutions?
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.840]   - I don't like the prosperity gospel
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.440]   because the gospel is about Jesus' journey
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.320]   into radical self-forgetfulness on the cross.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:27.320]   And he never makes a promise of earthly well-being.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.800]   - Can you explain what the prosperity gospel is?
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.760]   - Yeah, the view that if I follow Jesus
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.520]   and I follow God with great trust
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.840]   that I will be rewarded with wealth
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.080]   and position and status in this world.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.040]   It might be God's will that I get that.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.560]   But Aquinas said this,
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.160]   if I look at a very sinful person,
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.520]   I say, "God, he's got a great house
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.680]   "and he's richer than I am and all that."
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.960]   Aquinas says, "Yeah, but maybe that's a punishment
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.320]   "'cause maybe all that is leading him away from God.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.240]   "And actually that's God's way of punishing him.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.480]   "And the fact that you don't have wealth in a big house
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.080]   "is actually a great gift to you
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.440]   "because now it frees you for doing God's will."
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   So we can't read God's favor in worldly terms.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:13.120]   I would say God's favor is, am I awakened to deeper love?
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.360]   Then I know that I'm finding God's favor.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.680]   Now God might decide,
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.520]   "Sure, I want you to have this and that.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.080]   "I wanna provide this to you."
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:20.920]   Fine.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.820]   Then I say, "Thank you, Lord.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.280]   "How can I use it as an instrument of love?"
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.800]   All the masters talk about detachment.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.680]   And that's another reason I don't like the prosperity gospel
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   is though I'm getting attached now
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.040]   to all these material advantages.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.280]   And I'm even seeing them as a sign of God's favor.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.360]   Let go of all that.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.040]   You let go of it and use it as a vehicle of love.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.280]   So if you're rich, the right question is,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.180]   "Okay, Lord, why did you allow me to become rich?
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.580]   "So that what can I do?
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.940]   "How can my riches be an expression of love?
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.300]   "If I'm popular, if I'm healthy,
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.580]   "okay, why am I popular?
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.420]   "Why am I healthy?
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.560]   "How can I use that for your good?
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.840]   "I'm sick, in bed, I'm suffering.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.480]   "Okay, Lord, how can I use that as an expression of love?"
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.460]   So I'd rather measure it that way
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.540]   than through worldly success.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:10.020]   That's why I'm against the prosperity gospel.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.860]   - Okay.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.580]   So there is a don't seek worldly possessions,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.260]   but whatever happens to you, good or bad,
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.860]   seek how that could be used
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.940]   to increase the amount of love in the world.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.780]   - Right.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.340]   The image I love for this is the Wheel of Fortune,
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.860]   which is a device in a lot of the Gothic cathedrals.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.420]   And it's this great circle, right, this wheel.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.220]   At the top of it is a king, and then it turns this way,
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.540]   and the king has lost his crown.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.940]   And the bottom is a pauper.
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:42.500]   And then over here is a guy climbing up to power, right?
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.740]   And then in the middle is a depiction of Christ.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.700]   And the idea is very simple but very profound,
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.420]   that the wheel is life, you know?
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.900]   It's sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.160]   Sometimes you have power and popularity and prestige.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.740]   Other times you're losing it, you're going down.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.940]   Other times you've got none of it.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.460]   Other times you're coming back up.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.820]   Okay, don't live on the rim of the wheel.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:02.820]   It'll make you crazy.
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.240]   Every point on the rim of the wheel is a point of anxiety.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.260]   Where you should live is the center of the wheel,
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.020]   where Christ is, right?
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.300]   'Cause that's the link now to the eternity of God.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.620]   That's the point of love,
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.580]   where love can flow through you to the world.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.940]   And then you can look at the wheel.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.220]   You're a Beatles fan, right?
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.060]   I think I discovered that.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.320]   I love the Beatles.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.500]   And the song that always comes to my mind
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.740]   when I think of that image is John Lennon
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.700]   at the end of his life.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.940]   So a guy that, I mean, rode the wheel of fortune like crazy.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:36.480]   You know, he was at the top of the world in every way.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.060]   And then Beatles break up and he kind of loses it.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.360]   And then he's at the lost weekend in the 70s
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.600]   at the very bottom.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.300]   When he died, he was just kind of coming back up again.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.280]   But the song I always think of is watching the wheels,
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.720]   right, I'm just sitting here watching the wheels
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.560]   go round and round.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.800]   I really love to watch them roll
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.420]   'cause I'm no longer riding on the merry-go-round.
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.000]   That's right out of the medieval mystics,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.280]   that he's not riding on the wheel.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.340]   He's just watching it go round and round.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.520]   That's the point of, the Greeks call it apatheia,
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.920]   and the Latins call it indifference.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.620]   Not like I'm blasé, it just means I'm detached
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.880]   from success, failure, less success, more success.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.160]   I'm detached from that.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.660]   I'm sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.600]   'cause I'm not riding on it anymore.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.620]   The mystics have always made that transition.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.840]   - Let me ask you a difficult question
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.940]   about the darker side of human nature,
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.400]   of human power, of institutions.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.080]   What's your view on the long history
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.660]   and widespread reports of sexual abuse of children
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.800]   by Catholic priests?
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.960]   So this is a difficult topic,
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.460]   but maybe an important one to shine a light on.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.280]   - Yeah, it's awful.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.000]   And it's been a problem, go back to Peter Damian,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.280]   back in the 11th century was talking about it.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.260]   So it's been a problem.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.620]   And whenever really sinful human beings
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.420]   have been in close proximity to children,
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.360]   we find this issue.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.520]   Has it been around the church?
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.360]   Yes.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.980]   Has it surfaced in a kind of sickening way
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.000]   in the last 30 years?
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:07.900]   Absolutely.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:14.040]   I'm glad the church has made important strides, and it has.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.800]   Back in 2002, there was a thing called the Dallas Accords
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.960]   where the bishops of America put a lot of these protocols
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.580]   in place that really have been effective
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.740]   at ameliorating this problem.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.360]   The numbers spiked in the '70s and '80s,
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.320]   and that's been demonstrated over and over again.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.400]   And then they fell dramatically after that.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.720]   So that's not to excuse anything,
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.320]   but it's to say I think progress has been made with it.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.880]   - What's the impulse to secrecy?
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.920]   - Yeah, well, to protect institutions.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.480]   That's always, that's a sinful instinct.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.320]   I mean, not altogether.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.240]   I mean, sure, an institution is worth protecting,
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.040]   but if it reaches the point where you're indifferent
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.160]   to people's well-being, then you're in trouble.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.840]   - So institutions' role should be transparent
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:01.280]   and honest with the sins of its members and of itself.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.280]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:07.320]   - So maybe you can speak to the fact,
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:12.000]   as a priest, a bishop, as part of Catholicism,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.520]   you're not allowed to marry, you're not allowed to have sex,
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.240]   you're sworn to celibacy.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.080]   What is behind that idea?
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   What is the sort of, we've talked about some broad stroke
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.480]   ideas of love, what's behind the idea of celibacy?
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.520]   - And that's a good way to get at it.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.760]   It's a path of love.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.320]   So the church is always in favor of inculcating love.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.360]   Marriage is a path of love, but so is celibacy.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:46.480]   St. Paul talks about someone who is preoccupied
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.640]   with the things of this world and family,
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.720]   and those who are free from that
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.440]   are freer for doing the work of God.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.320]   So that's kind of a pragmatic justification for celibacy.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.120]   And we still, I think, take that seriously.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.640]   Look at my own life, I mean, celibacy has enabled me
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.960]   to do all kinds of things and go places
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.960]   and minister in a way that I could not
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.360]   if I had been married.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.280]   So I get it, I get the pragmatic side.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.560]   But I'm more interested in the sort of mystical side of it.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.960]   Remember Jesus was challenged about the person
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.360]   who had a whole series of husbands
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.280]   and then they all died, and so in heaven,
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.760]   which one will, which husband will the wife have?
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:30.440]   And his answer is, in heaven, people don't marry
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.920]   and they're not given in marriage.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.360]   There's a higher way of love.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.760]   It's a more radical way of love.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.560]   It's not tied to a particular,
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.040]   but I think through God is tied to everybody.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.400]   The celibate, and this has been
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.080]   from the beginning of the church, not as a law,
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.240]   but there were celibates from the very beginning
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.480]   of the church, including Jesus, of course, and Paul.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.840]   They sense something, that that way of living
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.760]   mystically anticipates the way we'll love in heaven.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.520]   It's a sign even now within this world
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.760]   of how we will all love in heaven.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.620]   So in that way, it's a bit like pacifists.
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.360]   I'm glad there are pacifists in the church.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   And I've known some very powerful witnesses to pacifism.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.240]   I'm glad there are pacifists
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.880]   because they witness even now to how we will be in heaven
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.320]   when every tear is wiped away
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.920]   and we beat our swords into plowshares
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.960]   and heaven's a place of radical peace.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.080]   But some people even now live it.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.080]   At the same time, I'm glad not everyone's a pacifist
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.240]   'cause I would hold with the church to just war theory
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.120]   that there's sometimes all we can do in this finite world
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.560]   is to fight manifest wickedness.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.800]   - And just in the same way there's just sex.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.640]   (laughing)
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.760]   - Well, no, right, I'm glad there are celibates,
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.600]   but I'm glad not everyone's a celibate.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.080]   I wouldn't want that.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.880]   Because married love is a marvelous expression
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.760]   of the divine love.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.000]   So that's why it's good there are some.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.740]   And it's always been a small number.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.480]   - The actual experience of it, would you,
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.800]   the spiritual nature of it, is it similar to fasting?
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.720]   So I've been enjoying fasting recently,
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   so not eating for several days, that kind of stuff.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.800]   And that somehow brings you even deeper,
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.040]   I'm in general in love with everything,
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.720]   with nature and everything, I see the beauty in the world.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.680]   But there's a greater intensity to that
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.640]   when you're fasting, for example.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.240]   - Yeah, I might use the language of sublimation
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.080]   or redirection of energy and all that.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.680]   I think that's true.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.760]   There's a certain sublimation of energies
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:45.760]   into prayer, into mysticism, into ministry,
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.720]   a redirection of energies.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.920]   So it's meant to be life-enhancing.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.760]   The same way fasting is, it's meant ultimately
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.520]   to be life-enhancing and make you healthier and happier.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.240]   So celibacy is a path of love.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.560]   And I think it does involve a certain
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.640]   redirection of energies, I'd say that.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.280]   - Don't you think, do you think,
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   it's a heavy burden for some humans to bear?
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.400]   - Sure. - For some priests to bear?
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.400]   Is that the thing, given the sexual abuse scandal
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.200]   is that the thing that breaks humans?
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   - No, I wouldn't tie that to celibacy.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.360]   And that's been demonstrated over and over again.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.720]   There's a priest named Andrew Greeley
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.800]   who was a priest from my home diocese of Chicago.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.920]   And Andy did a lot of research,
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.200]   he was a sociologist of religion,
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.080]   did a lot of research into that very question.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.720]   And there really is not a correlation
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.920]   between celibacy per se and the sexual abuse
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.720]   of children or of anybody.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.400]   So I wouldn't make that correlation.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.920]   - So bad people, sinful people are going
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.520]   to do what they're going to do.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.880]   - I think people who have a tendency
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.880]   toward abusing children sexually are drawn
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.680]   to situations where they get ready access
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.680]   to kids and they get institutional cover.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.160]   So that's, I can go through the list
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.000]   from sports and Boy Scouts, et cetera.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.960]   And that's been proven again and again.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.600]   So I would tie it more to that.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.080]   I wouldn't tie it to celibacy.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.400]   - So the challenge, of course, is all kinds of,
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.280]   you said institutional cover.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.800]   There's all kinds of institutions that cover
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.720]   for people that do evil onto the world,
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.500]   that do sinful things onto the world.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.120]   But there's something about the church,
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:31.560]   which is, as an organism, is supposed
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.320]   to be an embodiment of good in this world,
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.760]   of love in this world.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.240]   And it breaks people's hearts to see this kind of,
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.880]   even a small amount, this kind of thing happen
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.240]   within the church.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.080]   It wakes you up to the cruelty,
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.320]   the absurdity of the world sometimes.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.960]   Like, it's back to the question
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.720]   of why do bad things happen to good people?
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.040]   Why does God allow this kind of thing to happen?
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.520]   And sort of maybe an unanswerable question.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.180]   Do you have an answer to that question?
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.960]   - I can gesture toward it using rather abstract language,
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.840]   which is true enough, it's completely
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.800]   emotionally unsatisfying.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.360]   But it's naming it truthfully enough.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.120]   And it goes back to Augustine, which is,
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   God permits evil to bring about a greater good.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.840]   Now again, I know how unsatisfying
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.120]   that sort of spare, austere language can sound.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.320]   But it gets us off the horns of a dilemma.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.840]   Aquinas, when he lays out a question,
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.960]   he always has the objections first.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.340]   So is there a God?
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.800]   Well, objection one, objection two, objection three.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.040]   And he's really, talk about steel manning
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.000]   and argument, Aquinas is great at that.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.280]   One of the really steel manned arguments,
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.400]   is that the right grammatical form?
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.960]   One of the, what's the past participle of the steel man?
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.860]   But one of the best arguments, he formulates it this way.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:03.320]   If one of two contraries be infinite,
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.320]   the other would be altogether destroyed.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.400]   And as an example from his medieval physics,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.720]   he goes, if there were infinite heat,
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.480]   there'd be no cold, right?
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.620]   But God is described as infinitely good.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.560]   Therefore, if God exists, there should be no evil.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.000]   But there is evil, therefore God does not exist.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.400]   That's a darn good argument.
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.080]   That's a really persuasive argument.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.880]   And I think, I've done this for a long time
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.720]   in apologetics and in sort of higher philosophy,
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.620]   that's the best argument against God.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.160]   But here's something, before I press ahead with it,
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.680]   something I find really interesting.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.560]   I think the three best arguments against God
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.380]   all come from within the religious tradition.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.000]   Namely, the book of Job.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.720]   So Job, he's great.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.160]   I mean, he's a great guy.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.400]   He does everything right.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.360]   He's God's great servant,
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:58.200]   and he's punished in every possible way.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.600]   You know, he has every possible suffering.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.700]   Aquinas' argument from the Summa,
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.040]   and then to your friend and mine, Dostoevsky.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.160]   I think in the Brothers Karamazov,
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.800]   Ivan's argument when he's trying to
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.160]   wreck the faith of Alyosha.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:17.280]   And it's these examples drawn, they think,
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.540]   from Dostoevsky, from the headlines of his own time,
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.460]   of the most abject cruelty to children.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.900]   Like an innocent child being made to suffer.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:32.040]   How in God's name could that happen
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.380]   if God exists and he's all good?
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.880]   So I get it, but see, the book of Job,
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.320]   Thomas Aquinas, Dostoevsky,
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.000]   these are all profoundly believing people.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.920]   Like when I hear Stephen Fry,
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.360]   you know, the famously atheist writer,
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:50.160]   he will bring out this argument with great authority.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.280]   He does.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.440]   Of, you know, children with bone cancer
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.620]   and worms that go into the eyes of children
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.320]   and blind them before they kill them.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.640]   But he's been preceded by the author of Job,
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.200]   Thomas Aquinas, and Dostoevsky,
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   who stood right, think of Job, in the whirlwind.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.040]   He stands there in the whirlwind, you know?
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.280]   So you can't blame the Christian tradition
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.040]   for not dealing with this problem.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.160]   You know, for like brushing it under the carpet.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.480]   I mean, it has stood in the whirlwind of this problem.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   - It's still a difficult problem to deal with,
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.920]   that there's all this cruelty of the world.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:33.120]   There's a lot of example through history, just--
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:33.960]   - Yeah.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.760]   - In my own family history with the Soviet Union,
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:41.760]   with Stalin, the atrocities that Stalin has brought onto
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:48.200]   the people of the Soviet Union throughout the 20th century
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.000]   is nearly immeasurable.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:51.840]   - Yeah.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:57.080]   - And yet, when you look at the entirety of human history,
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.840]   you will see progress, not just the Soviet Union,
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.440]   but the entirety of the civilization
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.920]   throughout the 20th century.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.840]   And Stalin has a role to play.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:10.760]   There's a dark aspect to somehow evil
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.720]   helps us make progress.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.820]   And I don't know how to put that in the calculation.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:23.680]   On a local scale, I want to alleviate suffering.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   I'm probably a heavily lean pacifist.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.380]   Not out of weakness, but out of strength.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.380]   But man, it does seem that history is sprinkled with evil,
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:41.320]   and that evil does somehow nudge us towards good.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.160]   - Yes, sometimes we can see it.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.580]   And that's where the idea comes from,
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.840]   that evil's permitted to bring about some greater good.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.340]   And we can sometimes really see it.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.880]   Can we always see it?
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.340]   No, in fact, typically we don't see it.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.160]   But now you bring another factor into this,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.880]   which is the difference between our minds and God's mind.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.200]   So our minds, I mean, look,
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.120]   even they're remarkably capacious,
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   but they take in a tiny, tiny, tiny swath of space and time.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.880]   And even like our eyes can only take in
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.000]   so much of the light spectrum,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.120]   and these little ape sensorium that we have
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.600]   that can just take in a little tiny bit of reality, really.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.560]   How are we ever in a position to say,
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.720]   oh no, there's no possible good
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.160]   that would ever come from that?
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.080]   Even the greatest evil that, you know,
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.620]   every Dostoevsky and can conjure up and Stephen Fry,
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:39.280]   still, how could we have the arrogance to say,
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.520]   I know there's no good that could ever come from that.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.680]   I know there's no morally justifiable reason
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.320]   why God would ever permit that.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.160]   'Cause I think that's hubris to the nth degree,
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.800]   for us to say that.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.240]   And that's the assumption behind this claim,
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.640]   that God can permit evil to bring about a greater good.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.080]   Now God understands it.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.480]   But we're like little kids, you know,
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.240]   like a four year old, and their parents make a decision,
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.360]   and we say, what in the, why in the world
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.600]   would you do this to me?
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.240]   This is my pastoral experience.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.320]   Years ago, there was a young father,
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.480]   and his son was like three or something.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.600]   And he was in the hospital for something,
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.400]   I forgot what it was, but he had to undergo surgery, right?
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.680]   So after the surgery, he's in great pain,
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.600]   this poor kid, this three year old kid.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.000]   And the dad was there with him, you know,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.560]   holding his hand, and the son,
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.680]   this is what the father told me,
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.600]   he said, he's looking at me like, what gives here?
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.800]   I mean, why would you, you love me,
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.160]   I've always assumed that,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.120]   and yet you're presiding over this somehow,
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.760]   you're approving of this,
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.600]   and doing nothing to get me out of it, right?
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.400]   And he said the kid couldn't articulate that,
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.800]   but his eyes did.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.600]   And the father said, it was just killing me,
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.680]   because I knew I couldn't explain it to him.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.200]   And it's true, I mean, he could vaguely gesture toward,
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.040]   but the kid didn't understand surgery,
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.160]   and cutting his body, and taking things out of it,
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.760]   and that this was gonna, you know,
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:06.000]   make him much better in the long run.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.600]   But I remember thinking, that's a great metaphor
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.040]   for us vis-a-vis God, is here's God,
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.400]   infinitely loving God, who's with us all the time,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.720]   and we say, what are you doing?
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.160]   Why aren't you taking this away from me?
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.040]   And the answer, I mean, ultimately, is trust.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.520]   Trust me, trust me.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.040]   Surrender to me.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.440]   - And when we don't, that's,
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.040]   we get in trouble with the old pride,
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.320]   and the hubris, and all that kind of stuff.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.440]   - Yeah, no, but, and trust me when I tell you,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.160]   I mean, I completely get it in my own life,
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.040]   and as a priest, you're dealing with suffering all the time,
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.440]   with people in pain all the time.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.400]   I remember as a young priest,
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.120]   there was a policeman in our parish,
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.440]   so he had a gun, and inexplicably,
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:54.080]   no one had any clue, he got up one night,
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.120]   shot his son to death, and then shot himself.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.280]   This is my parish.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.320]   So I went to the wake, I remember, I show up,
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.760]   and I'm this young 27-year-old goofball priest,
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.120]   and I roll my collar around, and I walk in,
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.000]   and there were two coffins.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.040]   There were two coffins in the room,
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.720]   you know, there's the son and the father.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.120]   And the mother was there, and she,
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.480]   she went like this to me, like,
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.240]   she saw me, like, okay, you're the religious guy here,
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.720]   - Yeah. - what?
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.040]   And just by instinct, I went like that too.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.160]   I went like, I don't, I don't know what to tell you.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.400]   I can't, I don't have an answer for you.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.960]   But I was there, and I'm not saying
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.640]   to pat myself on the back, it's just,
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.000]   that's where the church goes, because Jesus went there.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.880]   See, now we're gesturing toward a more theological response.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.040]   The first one's more austerely philosophical,
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.480]   you know, God permits evil to bring about a good,
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.920]   but the theological response is,
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.000]   that's where Christ went, is he went all the way down.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.680]   He went all the way down into our suffering.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.680]   And see the cross as the limit case of evil,
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:08.080]   humiliation and cruelty and institutional injustice
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.160]   and psychological suffering and spiritual suffering
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.760]   and death, it's all there,
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.000]   and that's where the Son of God went.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.360]   And I would say that's why, as a priest, I went there.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.120]   That's my job, is to go to those places, you know.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.160]   So that's the ultimate answer to the problem.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:30.840]   - So there is, we can't comprehend it,
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.040]   but there is meaning to the suffering and the injustice.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.320]   - We trust it because we know on other grounds
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.160]   of God's existence.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.720]   See, I would resist the claim that,
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.440]   well, this is such a knockdown argument,
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.720]   so now we know there is no God.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.360]   I would say, no, there are all kinds
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.960]   of other rational warrants for God,
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.680]   and so I know that God exists.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.360]   I know that God is infinite love,
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.200]   and now I gotta square that with this experience.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.160]   And the way I do that is by a trusting confidence
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.160]   that God knows what he's about, you know.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.600]   Again, I know how inadequate that always seems
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.680]   to anyone who's suffering, including myself,
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.640]   when I'm in great suffering,
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.920]   but I think that's the best that we've done
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.280]   in the great tradition.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.120]   - So if you were to steel man the case against God
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.720]   or the existence of God,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.920]   you find the most convincing argument
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.560]   is there's evil in the world, therefore there's no God.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.640]   - There's too much of it.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.000]   If I were to steel man that argument,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.280]   I'd do what Stephen Fry does.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.160]   I would do what Dostoevsky's Ivan does.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.440]   I would do exactly that.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.200]   I would say there's just too much.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.240]   And then if you wanna keep pressing it, animal suffering.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.960]   So we talk about human suffering,
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.840]   but the suffering of animals over the eons and so on,
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.540]   isn't there just too much suffering
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.300]   to be reconciled with an infinitely good God?
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.980]   And that's, again, Thomas Aquinas.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.020]   I've just used his very steel-manned argument.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.220]   - You mentioned that, again, on Reddit,
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:02.020]   somebody asked who your favorite communicator
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:06.820]   of atheist ideas was, and you mentioned Christopher Hitchens.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.820]   Are there other ideas for atheism
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.020]   that you find particularly challenging?
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.020]   - Well, that's the one, is the problem of evil.
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:19.740]   The other objection in Aquinas,
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.380]   which has a lot of contemporary resonance,
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.340]   is can't we just explain everything through natural causes?
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:27.980]   Why would you have to invoke a cause
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.420]   beyond the causes in the world?
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.660]   So as I'm trying to explain, let's say for Aquinas,
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.020]   motion, causality, finality,
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.180]   can't I just do that with natural causes?
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.440]   Wouldn't that suffice to explain it?
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.780]   So I get like when naturalists are speaking,
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.420]   or people that are pure materialists,
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.860]   they'll just say, no, that's perfectly adequate.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.940]   A scientific account of reality
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:54.220]   is utterly adequate to our experience.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.820]   So I would steel-man that and say,
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.660]   well, show me why we need something more.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.620]   And to do that, you gotta get out of Plato's cave,
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.700]   it seems to me.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.220]   Because my objection to naturalism
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.140]   is it's staying within the realm
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.900]   of the immediately empirically observable,
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.380]   and making the mistake of saying
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.700]   that's all there is to being.
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.820]   That's all there is that needs to be explained.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:27.380]   And long before we get to religion, just stay with Plato.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.820]   The first step out of the cave,
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:31.060]   if you combine it now with the parable of the line,
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.100]   is mathematical objects.
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.500]   And I'm with those, the many people that would say,
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.720]   mathematics is an experience of the immaterial.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.840]   I've stepped out of a merely empirical,
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.000]   physical, naturalistic world.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.280]   The minute I understand a pure number,
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.080]   or a pure equation, or a pure mathematical relationship,
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.380]   which would obtain in any possible world,
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.840]   which are not tied to space and time,
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.360]   that's a first step out of the cave.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.560]   And then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.020]   For example, on the nature of being.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.860]   I mean, so I could talk about this thing
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.660]   as a physical object, and I can analyze it
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.760]   at all kinds of levels, and follow all the scientists
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.540]   up and down through this thing, and fine, fine.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.920]   But I'm still in Plato's cave.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.680]   I'm still looking at the flickering images on the wall.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.160]   But when I step out of that into the mathematical realm,
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.960]   I have entered a different realm of being, seems to me.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.340]   - Do you think it's possible for the cave to expand
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.860]   so large that it encompasses the whole world?
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:37.860]   Meaning, is it possible that we're just clueless right now
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:41.560]   in terms of, scientifically speaking,
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.220]   with most of the world we haven't figured out yet.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.680]   But do you think it's possible through science
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.500]   to know God, to look outside the world?
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.440]   So it's fundamentally the limit of the empirical
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.580]   scientific method is that we can't know
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.840]   some of these very big questions.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.080]   - No, I love the, I'm not a scientist,
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.240]   and I was never all that good at science.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.600]   I was more humanities guy.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.640]   But I love and respect the sciences, but I hate scientism.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.760]   And scientism is rampant today,
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.440]   with especially young people.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.480]   The reduction of all knowledge to the scientific
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.560]   form of knowledge, and I'm a vehement opponent of that.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.800]   There are dimensions of being that are not capturable
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.440]   through a scientific method of mere observation,
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.180]   hypothesis formation, experimentation, et cetera.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.860]   As great as that is, as wonderful as that is,
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.380]   but it's still, I think, within Plato's cave.
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.020]   And that's not to say it's not real.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.160]   It's just at a relatively low level of reality.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.820]   You step out of Plato's cave when you go
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.920]   into the pure mathematics.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   That's why, you know that article,
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.320]   I just came across it recently,
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.560]   and discovered this whole literature around it,
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.720]   is Eugene Wigner's article in 1960,
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.500]   called the Unreasonable Applicability of Mathematics
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.560]   to the Physical Sciences.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.500]   I think that's the title of it.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.880]   - Or Effectiveness or something like that, yeah.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.920]   - But what's so cool is, you know,
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.040]   he's not a religious man.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.920]   He was kind of a secular Jew.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.680]   But yet he uses the word miracle
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.620]   like eight times in that article.
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.580]   'Cause he just is so impressed by the fact
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.700]   that high, complex mathematics
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.600]   describes so accurately the physical world,
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.180]   and can be used to create things and to manipulate.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.360]   And why should that be true?
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.500]   There's something very weirdly mysterious
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.060]   about that relationship, you know?
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.780]   And I would say it's because you've stepped
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.780]   into a higher order of being,
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.240]   which is inclusive of a lower level of being.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.140]   That's the Platonic approach, is that as you move,
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.220]   now I'm going to a different metaphor,
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.340]   you move to higher levels,
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.340]   they're inclusive of the lower levels.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.540]   - Yeah, there's some magic there
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:38.220]   that seems to, at least in our current understanding
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:42.300]   of science, to be not quite capturable.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.220]   Even consciousness, the idea of consciousness.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.740]   - Can I ask you, where do you think
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.020]   the laws of nature come from?
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.900]   So, I mean, sort of the Wigner question,
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.460]   where does the deep,
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:56.240]   the deep mathematical structure of things come from?
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.320]   How do you explain that?
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.640]   - The mathematical structure,
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.900]   or the fact that the structure
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.300]   is somehow pleasing and beautiful?
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.960]   'Cause those are different.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:06.800]   Those are two different--
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.060]   - No, but do the first one first.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:11.020]   I'm just curious, where do you think it comes from?
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:13.260]   - I tend to believe, even in terms of physics,
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.200]   we don't really know what's going on.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.620]   There's so, so, so much more to be discovered.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.060]   We're walking around in the dark
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.620]   trying to figure out little puzzles here and there,
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.620]   and we're patting ourselves on the back
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.060]   and how many puzzles we've discovered so far.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.140]   Even Gato's incompleteness theorem,
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.040]   what are the limits of mathematics, axiomatic systems?
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.260]   I don't know what is the purpose of mathematics,
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.860]   what is the power of mathematics?
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:43.860]   Is it just a useful tool to study the world around us,
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:49.240]   or is it something deeper that we're just discovering?
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.460]   All I know, from my emotional perspective,
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:56.980]   now I am an engineer, I'm a robotics AI person,
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.180]   from an emotional perspective,
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.940]   I just find the whole thing beautiful.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.700]   - Yeah, but that's really cool to me.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:03.820]   That's a very interesting clue.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.400]   See, one of the arguments for God
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.700]   is based on the intelligibility of the world.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.460]   It's like Wigner, it's a very peculiar fact,
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:13.180]   it seems to me, that the world is so radically intelligible.
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.460]   Why should that be true?
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.900]   Why should it be the case
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.820]   that being has this intelligible structure to it?
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:21.580]   So it corresponds to an inquiring mind.
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:25.460]   So Aquinas can say that the intelligible in act
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.260]   is the intellect in act,
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.580]   meaning there's some deep correspondence
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.460]   between this and that.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:36.540]   I'm with Wigner, that's, I think, really weird
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.980]   and unreasonable and strange.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:43.980]   Now, my answer is, because the creator of the universe
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.540]   is a great mind, and has stamped the world
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:50.520]   with intelligibility.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.300]   In the beginning was the word, right?
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:53.300]   And the word was with God,
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.500]   and all things came to be through the word.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.540]   We shouldn't picture that so much.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.920]   It's gesturing in this very powerful direction.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.540]   There's an intelligence
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.900]   that has imbued the world with intelligibility.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.980]   And we discover that, you know?
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.380]   - There's something about the simplicity
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.860]   of the way the world works,
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.580]   that's where the beauty comes from.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.620]   And yes, there is something profound to the mechanism,
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.740]   whatever that is.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.240]   God that brought that to be.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.000]   - That thought it into being.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.440]   That the world has been,
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.640]   when the Bible says that God said,
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.880]   "Let there be light," and there was light,
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.560]   God said, well, again, we don't literalize the poetry,
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.040]   but it's very rich that God spoke the world into being.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.540]   So that means it's been imbued with intelligibility
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.520]   from the beginning.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.680]   They say that, you know, the condition for the possibility
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.800]   of the Western physical sciences
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.000]   was a basically Christian idea,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.460]   namely that the world is not God,
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.100]   therefore I can analyze it, experiment upon it,
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.660]   I don't divinize it,
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.740]   I don't have a mystical relation to the world,
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.980]   it's not God.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.160]   But secondly, that it's absolutely,
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.360]   in every nook and cranny, intelligible.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.740]   And those two ideas are correlated to the idea of creation.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:09.780]   So it's been created, it's not God, it's other than God,
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.580]   but yet it's touched in every dimension by God's mind.
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.460]   And when those two things are in place,
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.460]   the sciences get underway.
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.620]   I don't worship the world anymore,
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.420]   but I'm also utterly confident I can come to know it.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.580]   And those are theological ideas.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.180]   - Well, we live in this world,
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.640]   so we can solve quite a lot of problems of this world
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.020]   by making the assumption
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.740]   that this world is fully understandable.
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.880]   And we don't need to worry about what's outside the world
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.460]   in some sense in order to build bridges and rockets
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.660]   and computers and all that kind of stuff.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.180]   It's only when we get to the questions that are deeper
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:49.380]   about why we're here at all,
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.060]   what does it mean to be good,
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.060]   all those kinds of things
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.500]   do we need to reach outside of this world.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.940]   - Well, can I introduce another one?
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.340]   So I talked about mathematics,
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.700]   I think it's stepping out of the cave,
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.720]   it's stepping out of just the purely empirical world.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.100]   But the very fact that we use a word like universe
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.300]   to me is very interesting.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.480]   Even if you say multiple universes,
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.020]   to me it's like, well, they're,
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:13.460]   whatever the whole is, the totality.
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.640]   Universum, turn toward the one.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.720]   Why would we call it that?
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.560]   Why wouldn't we just call it an aggregate?
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.000]   It's just an aggregate of stuff,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.200]   it's an aggregate of all,
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.880]   but we call it a universe.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.760]   And my answer from the classical metaphysical tradition is,
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.340]   it's the intuition of being.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.680]   So I immediately experienced things here,
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.080]   the color and shape, and I can measure them.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.240]   But when I've really stepped out of the cave
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.480]   and I've now engaged beyond mathematics even,
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.640]   I'm now into metaphysical reflection.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.780]   I'm interested not just in this thing as an object
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.240]   and how it's colored and shaped
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.520]   and what its atoms and quarks and all that are.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.560]   That's fine.
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.480]   But I'm interested now in,
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.600]   what does it mean to say this thing is real?
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.160]   So what makes this a being?
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.380]   And then what are the characteristics of being?
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.080]   So now from Aristotle to Heidegger,
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.680]   this question of the nature of being.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.920]   But see, I would say we call it a universe
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.000]   because it's turned toward the one of being.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.600]   It's this intuition that whatever,
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.380]   from quarks to galaxies to whatever,
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.360]   give me a billion other universes,
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.520]   it would still be existence.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:19.260]   It's turned toward the one.
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.460]   That being unites our experience.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.700]   And so now I'm at the metaphysical level of analysis.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.180]   I've taken another step out of the cave.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.400]   In Plato's language, I'm at the formal level now,
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.540]   beyond mathematics, the level of forms.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.160]   And the formal is inclusive of the mathematical,
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.260]   which is inclusive of the physical.
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:37.580]   And I think that's Eugene Wigner,
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.740]   is that the mathematical includes the physical.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:42.500]   It is metaphysically prior to it.
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:45.420]   - But here we are sitting in the physical
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.460]   trying to make sense of why the unreasonable effectiveness
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.900]   of the thing that's beyond, which is the mathematics.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.960]   - My answer is God.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.700]   And I don't know a better answer.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:58.700]   And as I read Wigner, he wasn't ready to say that.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.700]   But I think the language is gesturing.
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.860]   I was reading someone recently,
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:04.780]   some very well-known physicist,
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.580]   who said his answer to Wigner's question is
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:11.260]   that whoever is responsible for the universe
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:13.400]   must be a mathematician.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.180]   And I thought, yeah, that's right.
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:18.100]   - Let me ask you about Jordan Peterson.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.740]   You had a great conversation with him.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:24.220]   He has a complicated and nuanced view of faith,
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.920]   or faith period.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.700]   He has said that he believes in Jesus,
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.340]   the person and the myth,
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.660]   and some of the full richness and complexity
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.860]   that you've talked about.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.520]   But he's surprised by his faith.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.440]   He's not sure what to make of it.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.460]   He's almost like meta-struggling
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.940]   with what the heck is faith means.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.500]   He's a super powerful intellect that can't compute
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.180]   the faith that he's experiencing.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:52.400]   So what are some interesting differences
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.220]   between the two of you, or commonalities,
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:59.420]   in terms of your understanding of faith?
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.580]   - He's a very interesting guy.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.120]   I've had a couple conversations with him.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:06.020]   And I do think he's moving in the direction of faith.
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:09.120]   And his lectures in the Bible are very fine, I think.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.540]   He reminds me of the church fathers,
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.000]   because the church fathers would have looked at the,
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.500]   they call it the moral sense of the scripture.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.060]   Peterson would probably call it the psychological meaning.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.900]   But I think he's doing a lot of that.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.580]   He, as I read him and talk to him,
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.860]   I think he's kind of at a Kantian level in regard to Jesus.
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.480]   What I mean there is, for Kant,
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.780]   Jesus is, it's not so much the historical Jesus,
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:31.900]   this figure from long ago.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.780]   It's Jesus as an archetype of the moral life.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.820]   You know, he says he's the image of the person
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:39.620]   perfectly pleasing to God.
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:43.180]   And so Jesus inhabits our kind of moral imagination
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:48.100]   as a heuristic, as a goal that we're tending toward.
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.580]   But the historical person of Jesus for Kant,
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.980]   well, let's not fuss about that so much.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.740]   It's this figure.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:56.960]   And as I read Peterson, especially, and talk to him,
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.020]   I think he's kind of there with the archetype of Jesus.
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.860]   And even language of like, live as though God exists.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:06.820]   That's the (speaking in foreign language)
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.940]   the kind of as if attitude.
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:12.040]   And where I sort of press him when we talk
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.540]   is in the direction of, no, that's not Christianity yet.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.040]   I mean, that's enlightenment moral philosophy.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.540]   But Christianity is very interested
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.180]   in this historical figure,
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.460]   and very interested that God really became one of us.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.620]   And he's not just an archetype of the moral life.
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.000]   He's someone, he's a person, who's invaded our world
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.740]   and gone all the way to the bottom of sin
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.220]   and thereby saved us.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.780]   So the facticity of Jesus and then the resurrection.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:43.300]   So Peterson will talk about the resurrection
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.140]   as a myth and all that,
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.560]   and you can find that in different cultures, et cetera.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:51.380]   But Christianity is saying something else.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.880]   - So in Christianity, when we're talking about who is Jesus,
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.540]   it's not just an archetype.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:57.900]   It's not just a myth.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.880]   It's a historical figure and the very grounded fact
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:06.260]   that God became one of us is fundamental to this idea
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:09.340]   of what Christianity is, what it means to be a Christian.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:14.340]   It's the sin and the love that came here down to earth.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:17.780]   That means we can be one with God.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.700]   So that's essential.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:19.980]   It's not just an archetype.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.920]   - That's right.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.060]   You know, it always strikes me,
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.940]   the difference between, let's say,
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:28.740]   mythic expressions and the New Testament is,
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.620]   read someone like Carl Jung
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:33.060]   and then Joseph Campbell, whom he influenced,
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.500]   and then now Jordan Peterson, who's very Jungian,
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.860]   and this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.940]   And great, I mean, I think it's very interesting
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.280]   and there's a lot going on there.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.320]   There's a sort of calmness, though, about it.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.780]   Like, yeah, interesting, and that's in this culture
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.340]   and that culture, and it's the form of the moral life,
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.400]   and mm-hmm, I understand all that.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.200]   Then you read the New Testament.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:57.180]   Whatever those people are talking about, it's not that.
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.900]   They are grabbing you by the shoulders
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.020]   and shaking you to get your attention,
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.900]   to tell you about something that happened to them, right?
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.660]   Like the resurrection, the myth of the dying and rising God
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.540]   and how powerful it is in shaping our consciousness,
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:15.000]   mm-hmm, that's fascinating.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.340]   That's not the New Testament.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:18.460]   The New Testament is, did you hear?
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:22.100]   Did you, Jesus of Nazareth, whom they put to death,
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:25.060]   God raised him from the dead, and he was seen by 500,
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:29.700]   and he was seen by Peter, and then lastly, I saw him.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.260]   That's how Paul talks.
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:34.900]   It's not the detached, you know,
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.980]   psychologist musing on archetypal things,
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.580]   and I think that makes a huge difference
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:41.660]   when it comes to Christianity.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.940]   - The intensity of the historical details
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:49.940]   are essential here, so if you look at Hitler and Nazi Germany
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:53.380]   it's not enough to say, well, power corrupts,
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:57.020]   and sometimes, so looking at the archetype of Hitler,
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.740]   it's much, much more important, much more powerful
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:03.700]   to look at the details of how he came to power,
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.580]   what are the ways he did evil onto the world,
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.020]   and then you can get really intense about your struggle
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.620]   with some of the complexities of human nature and power
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.820]   on institutions and all that kind of stuff.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.380]   So the historical nature of the Bible,
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.940]   - We're an historical religion.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.340]   And we've been-- - Is important.
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.980]   - We generate philosophical reflection,
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.660]   we can find common ground with archetypal thinking
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.060]   and all that, we can.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.780]   And the church fathers used Greek philosophy,
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:33.420]   and Aquinas uses Aristotle, and all that's great,
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.340]   but we're an historical religion,
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.500]   and that matters immensely.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.740]   - Is the Bible the literal word of God?
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:44.420]   How do you make sense of the words that make up the Bible?
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:46.060]   - I think the best way to get at the Bible
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.380]   is to think of it as a library, not a book.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:50.180]   So it's a collection of books, right,
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:53.500]   from a wide variety of periods, different authors,
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.460]   different audiences, and different genre.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.420]   So in the Bible, you find poetry, you find song,
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:02.140]   you find something like history, not in our sense,
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.600]   but something like history.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.740]   You find gospel, which is its own genre,
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.780]   you find epistolary literature like Paul,
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.000]   you find apocalyptic, there's all this in the Bible.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.540]   So is the Bible literally the word of God?
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:18.620]   It's like saying, is the library literally true?
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.900]   It depends on what section you're in, right?
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:25.900]   So parts of like 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings,
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.300]   number places in the Old Testament.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.260]   Are there elements of the historical in there?
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.980]   Sure, but it's theologically interpreted history.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.940]   It's not like our sense of history of,
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.940]   give me 10,000 footnotes, and I'm gonna look
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.180]   at all the source material I can possibly find.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.140]   It's more like ancient history,
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.440]   like Herodotus, people like that.
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.220]   But then there's poetry, and there's myth,
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.800]   and there's legend, and there's song,
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:48.820]   and all that stuff in the Bible.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:53.820]   So God breathes through all of it, I would say.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.380]   He inspired all of it, right?
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:00.400]   Inspirare, he's breathing through all of it.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.780]   God is speaking through all of it.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:05.020]   But he speaks in different voices.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.900]   He uses different human instruments,
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.700]   and he uses different genre and different types of language.
[01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:10.940]   So we have to be sensitive to that
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.220]   when we're interpreting the Bible.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.020]   - So the different instruments are more or less,
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.080]   some are more perfect than others in terms of--
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.700]   - No, I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say more perfect.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.800]   I'd say they're just different.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.320]   It's like a symphony, and God's like a conductor,
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.640]   and there's all kinds of different instruments
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.400]   in the orchestra, and he loves
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.800]   just to breathe through the Psalms.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.120]   I prayed the Psalms this morning.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.560]   I do every day in my office.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.720]   Those are songs.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.080]   They probably were literally sung,
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.640]   most of them, at one point.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.440]   He breathes through apocalyptic.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.840]   We're reading the book of Revelation now
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.400]   in the Easter season, and it's this wild and wooly book.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.780]   It should be filmed by Spielberg or somebody today.
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.700]   And he speaks through the Gospels.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.900]   The Gospels correspond in genre
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.140]   to what I call ancient biography.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.140]   That's the genre of the Gospels.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.300]   It's wrong to call them mythic or simply literary.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.100]   They're like ancient biographies.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:05.740]   You have the Pauline letters, which are about
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.660]   particular cities that Paul was visiting
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.340]   and particular people he knew.
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:12.340]   So you just gotta be sensitive to the genre all the time.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.540]   Let's return back to human institutions
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:19.220]   and talk about history of human civilization and politics.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:23.300]   So one question to ask is, was America founded
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.420]   as a Christian nation, in your view?
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:28.740]   If we look at the Declaration of Independence,
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.700]   what did the words mean?
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.780]   We hold these truths to be self-evident,
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.800]   that all men are created equal,
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.860]   that they are endowed by their Creator
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.200]   with certain inalienable rights,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.800]   that among these are life, liberty,
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.840]   and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.520]   It seems like God is breathing through those words, too.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.200]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.220]   The founders, it would be some kind of combination of deism.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:56.920]   Certainly Christianity is coming up through them.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.040]   Enlightenment, rationalism, all in kind of a mix.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.280]   So you're not gonna find in our founding fathers
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.680]   simply a Thomas Aquinas or like a purely
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.200]   classically Christian understanding.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.680]   It's Christianity in those various expressions.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.560]   'Cause actually, I would see the Enlightenment
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.760]   as a sort of child of Christianity.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.600]   We could talk about that.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.560]   But having said all that, yes,
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.600]   I think they are expressing at least the residue
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:28.480]   of a once deeply integrated Christian sense of things,
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.800]   that our rights are not created by the government.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.020]   They're not doled out by the government.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.400]   They come from God.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.840]   And the other thing I find really interesting
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.800]   is equality, because look in classical philosophy,
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.320]   political philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.200]   It's not equality.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.120]   For them, it's our inequality that's really interesting.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.400]   So Plato divides us into these three classes.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.040]   And Aristotle says only a tiny little coterie
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.040]   of property males of sufficient education
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.280]   should be in the political life.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.200]   The rest should all be in private life.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.120]   And then some are suited for slavery.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.720]   So he divides us dramatically.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.120]   Same with Cicero and so on.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.240]   Where does this come from, this weird idea
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.020]   that we're all equal?
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:12.860]   I mean, how?
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:14.080]   We're not equal in beauty, not equal in strength,
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.080]   we're not equal in moral attainment,
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.400]   we're not equal in intelligence.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.140]   So what is it?
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.480]   And I think the residue especially comes through
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   in that little word, that all men are created equal.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.960]   That's our equality, that we're all equally
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.440]   children of God.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.840]   So take God out of the picture,
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.880]   I think we are gonna slide rapidly
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.480]   into an embrace of inequality.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.720]   Now, in the classical world, yes,
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:42.520]   but heck, look at the 20th century.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.920]   I mean, when God is excluded in a very systematic way,
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.160]   I think you saw the suspension of rights
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.720]   and the suspension of equality like mad.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:54.440]   So no, I think it's very important
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.920]   that God is in the picture
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.480]   and that we're a nation under God.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.440]   It matters enormously.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.280]   That's not pious boilerplate.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:03.440]   That's at the rational foundations of our democracy.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.520]   - So do you think Nietzsche was onto something
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.320]   with the idea, looking into the 20th century,
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.540]   that God is dead?
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:16.240]   That there is a cultural distancing
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.140]   from a belief in God?
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.680]   - Yeah, I'd be somewhat sympathetic
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.460]   to Jordan Peterson's reading of Nietzsche there.
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.400]   Namely, it's not Nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop,
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.600]   "Hey, God is dead."
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.120]   It's more of a lament.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.120]   God is dead and we've killed him.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.460]   And what will happen in the wake of that?
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:38.360]   And I think, yeah, much of the totalitarianism
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   of the 20th century follows from that questioning of God
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.960]   and the dismissal of God from public life.
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.760]   So I would be sympathetic with that.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:52.000]   When we're beyond good and evil,
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.400]   and all that's left is the will to power,
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.040]   and then why are we surprised that the powerful rise
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:01.120]   and that they use the power less for their purposes?
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:04.000]   When we forget ideas like equality and rights,
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.260]   which are grounded in God,
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.920]   why are we surprised that death camps follow?
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.440]   So I think there's a correlation there for sure.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.600]   - I don't know, I believe that there's a capacity
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.680]   to do good in all of us, and a capacity to do evil,
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.440]   and there's something that tends towards good.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.040]   Whatever that is.
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.920]   I tend to think that if that community,
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.680]   that love that we talked about, they find each other,
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.740]   they find the good.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:32.240]   If you don't constrain the resources,
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.160]   if you don't push them,
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.440]   if you don't artificially create conflict
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:41.280]   through power centers and evil charismatic leaders,
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.000]   then people will be good to each other.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.080]   And whether that's God or some other source
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:52.080]   of deep moral meaning,
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.520]   that seems to be essential for a functioning civilization.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.360]   - Yeah.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.280]   - And it's hard, I mean, that's what humans are.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.440]   We're searching for what that God is, what that means.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.800]   - You know what that triggers in my mind?
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.000]   I wonder if you agree with this,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.240]   that the modern sciences drew their strength
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.520]   from their narrowness.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.720]   What I mean there is they almost completely bracketed
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.080]   formal and final causality in the Aristotelian sense,
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.160]   and they focused on efficient and material causality.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:18.160]   And that gave, as I say, great strength,
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:20.120]   but from the narrowness of focus.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.620]   But for Aristotle, the more important causes
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.840]   are the final and the formal causes.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:28.360]   And so final causality there, what's drawing us?
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.360]   So for Aristotle, he'd look at someone like me and say,
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.920]   okay, you have a intelligible structure,
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.520]   and that leads you to seek certain things
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.040]   for the perfection of that structure.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.720]   And fair enough, I think that's right.
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.640]   So I seek the good.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.720]   Right now, I'm seeking the good of being with you.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:47.000]   I said, yeah, I'll sit down with Lex Friedman
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.480]   and we'll talk about deep and important things.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.280]   That's the good I sought this morning when I woke up.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:54.320]   Now, why am I seeking that?
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.920]   Well, for a higher reason, a higher good.
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.740]   'Cause it's part of my work, my ministry,
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:03.680]   is to the church reaching out beyond itself
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.680]   to the wider culture.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.120]   And okay, well, why do you want that?
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.040]   Well, 'cause I wanna bring more and more people
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.640]   into what I think is beautiful and true
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.840]   and good in the church.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.600]   Well, how come you want that?
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.460]   Well, because a long time ago,
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:19.780]   I was kind of myself brought into that realm
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.320]   and find it very compelling.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:22.520]   Yeah, but then why do you want that?
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.360]   Well, 'cause ultimately, I wanna be friends with God.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.000]   Now, I've given you one example there,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.680]   but any act of the will, it seems to me,
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.760]   has to be analyzed that way.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.160]   The will seeks something.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.420]   It seeks the good, right, by definition.
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.920]   But the good always nests like a Russian doll
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.440]   in a higher good, right, which then nests
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.080]   in a still higher good.
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:47.020]   Until you come, this is Aquinas, to some,
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:51.280]   in this sense, uncaused cause, an uncaused final cause,
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.480]   there has to be some summum bonum, right,
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:56.500]   some supreme good that you're looking for.
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.800]   And that's God, by the way.
[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.760]   That's another, I think, rational path to God
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.600]   is every single moment of every day,
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.000]   we are implicitly seeking God.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.840]   - So with your Word on Fire ministries
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.160]   and the website and the communication efforts,
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.200]   what is the thing you're seeking?
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:19.880]   Just you, if we can pause and for a brief moment,
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.440]   allow you to be prideful. (laughs)
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.800]   Or, and I'm of course just joking,
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.280]   but what is your local efforts,
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.320]   your small little pocket of the world
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:34.320]   with small in quotes, with Word on Fire?
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:37.760]   - Yeah, it's just using the media,
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.440]   especially the new media, the social media,
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:41.200]   to get the gospel out.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.800]   So I started, what, 20-some years ago,
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.600]   just on a radio show in Chicago, 5.15 on Sunday morning.
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:50.000]   I had a 15-minute sermon show.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.680]   And I asked the people in this parish I was at,
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:55.320]   I said, "I need $50,000 to get on for 15 minutes
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.920]   "at 5.15 on Sunday morning."
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.800]   And they all laughed when I proposed that,
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.080]   but they gave me the money.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.000]   So that's how I got started,
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.760]   just doing a sermon on the radio.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.320]   And then it branched off into video stuff and TV.
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.360]   And then I did a documentary.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.280]   I went all over the world
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.800]   and kind of told the story of Catholicism.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.960]   So that's how we started,
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.840]   and now I'm using all the new media and social media.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.080]   - But what I really love, what we're doing today,
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.200]   is something I really like,
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.960]   which is having a conversation
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.120]   outside of just the narrow Catholic world,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.480]   or even the narrow Christian world,
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.720]   but to look out to the wider culture.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.080]   And who's talking about interesting things,
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.280]   and how can the church engage there?
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.120]   So that's the purpose of Word on Fire.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.640]   - Is it overwhelming to face so many different
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:44.560]   atheists than complex thinkers like Jordan Peterson
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.520]   and some of the more political-style thinkers
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.160]   that you've spoken with?
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.680]   Is that, what is it, Dave Rubin,
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:57.680]   who's also has a way different world view as well.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.040]   Is that terrifying?
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.600]   Is that exciting to you?
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.440]   - Yeah.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.640]   - Is it challenging?
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:06.480]   - Yeah, maybe all of the above, but more exciting.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.920]   I would say I like doing that.
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.280]   I was a teacher for a long time.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.840]   I taught in a seminary for like 20 years.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.240]   And so I've been engaging these questions for a long time.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.520]   I'm a writer, I've written about 20-some books.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.800]   And I write some at a popular level,
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.440]   I write some at a high academic level,
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.400]   and I like doing all that.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:25.000]   So I love those ideas, I love those questions,
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.280]   love engaging people.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.680]   And I find, my own experience,
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.200]   you do run into, of course, a lot of the vitriol
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.760]   and kind of just stupidity and all that online,
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.600]   and I get it.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.200]   And religion is such a magnet for people's hostility
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.880]   for different reasons, so I get that.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.680]   Like Reddit, we talked about it.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:47.680]   You have to wade through swamps of obscenity and everything.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.280]   But I do it, and I like it, and it's worthwhile.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.120]   Because in that Reddit experience,
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:56.080]   so many of the issues that preoccupy young people,
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:58.640]   I can name them for you, exactly what they are.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:35:59.600]   Comes to religion.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:00.960]   How do you know there's a God?
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:01.960]   So the God question.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.520]   Secondly, why is there so much suffering in the world?
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.680]   A third question, why do you think your religion
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:08.920]   is the right religion?
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.280]   Fourth, why are you so mean to gay people?
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:14.720]   So those are the four things that I, again and again,
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:16.560]   come up when dealing with young people.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.160]   I've told my brother bishops and priests about that.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.160]   I said, structure your adult education programs,
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.080]   or structure your youth outreach
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.480]   around those four questions.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.360]   - Well, let me ask you about gay marriage.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:33.360]   How do we make sense of the love between a man and a man,
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.600]   and a woman and a woman, and the institution of marriage?
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.120]   - We love friendship, and friendship
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.200]   is at the heart of things.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.560]   And so nothing wrong with friendship
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.560]   between a man and a man, a woman and a woman.
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.360]   But go back to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas,
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.280]   about natural finalities and intelligible forms,
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.440]   that there's a certain form to human being,
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.800]   which includes the physical and includes the sexual.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.520]   It has a proper finality, and so we'd recognize
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.080]   that finality is twofold, both unitive and procreative.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.680]   And so those two we recognize as the appropriate expression
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.120]   of human sexuality.
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.560]   So that's why the church holds to sex
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.240]   between a man and a woman within the context of marriage
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.680]   is the right expression.
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:22.720]   We reach out to everybody in love, and in respect,
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.440]   and deep understanding, and seeking to understand
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.400]   their lives from the inside.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:31.480]   So I mean, all of that, I agree with the bridge building
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:34.120]   that we need to do to people like in the gay community,
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.600]   and people in gay marriage, and so on.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.440]   So the church holds to the intelligible structure,
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.520]   if you want, of human sexuality,
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:44.640]   and it reaches out to real human beings
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.880]   always in an attitude of invitation and love, and so on.
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.360]   So it's somewhere in there
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.240]   that the church takes its stance.
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:56.000]   - And so there's probably variation
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.280]   in the stances that it takes.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.000]   So you're saying the institution of marriage
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.280]   is about the unitive, which is like the friendship,
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.840]   the deep connection between two humans,
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.840]   and the procreative, so being able to have children,
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.000]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.640]   It's interesting.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.640]   So is our gay couple seen as sinful?
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.000]   So does the church acknowledge the love,
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.400]   that's the deep love that's possible between a man and a man?
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.360]   - I think so, which is why the church says
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.600]   in its official teaching, it's the physical expression,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.400]   let's say, of sexual passion between two men
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.760]   that is problematic.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.440]   Not their friendship, not their love for each other.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:43.480]   So I think, yeah, we confirm the first.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.600]   - Well, let me ask you another difficult topic
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.320]   that's just happened. - Unlike the other ones
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.160]   we've talked about. - Unlike the other ones
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.520]   we've talked about, that's going on in the news now.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.080]   As we sit here today, the Supreme Court has voted
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.920]   to overturn abortion rights in a draft majority opinion,
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.960]   striking down the landmark Roe versus Wade decision.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.080]   What are your thoughts on this?
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:06.840]   First of all, the human institution of the Supreme Court
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.000]   making these decisions throughout its history,
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.480]   and second of all, just the idea,
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.880]   the really powerful, the controversial,
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.320]   the difficult idea of abortion.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm against abortion.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.120]   I'm pro-life.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.320]   The church recognizes from the moment of conception
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.920]   we're dealing with a human life
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.600]   that's worthy of respect and protection,
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.680]   especially as you see the unfolding of that person
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.240]   across a pregnancy.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.480]   But at every stage, we recognize the beauty
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:44.400]   and the dignity of that human being.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.760]   And so we stand opposed to this,
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.640]   the outright killing of the innocent.
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.240]   So that's the church's view.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:56.120]   Again, reaching out always in love and understanding
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.040]   and compassion to those who are dealing,
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.920]   and believe me, every single pastor,
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.040]   every single priest understands that
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.320]   'cause we deal with people all the time
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.640]   who are in these painful situations.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:08.880]   But that's the moral side of it.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.680]   The legal side, I think Roe v. Wade was terribly decided.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:14.280]   I think one of the worst expressions of American law
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.960]   since the Dred Scott decision.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.800]   So I stand in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and Casey.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.080]   I think they were terrible.
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.520]   The Casey decision is instructive to me.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:28.040]   It belongs to the nature of freedom, that decision says,
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.520]   to determine the meaning of one's own life.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.520]   And I don't get the language exactly right,
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.680]   but and of the universe.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.560]   Like it gives this staggering scope to our freedom
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.280]   that we can determine the meaning.
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.320]   See, but that's repugnant
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.400]   to everything we've just talked about,
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.920]   that I'm inventing the meaning of my life
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.080]   and of the universe.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.240]   And so Casey, though, was instructive in a way
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:55.480]   because it tips its hat toward the problem culturally.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.560]   Is that I think in my freedom, I can determine everything.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.520]   My choice is all that matters.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.960]   And I would say, no, your choice should be correlated
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.600]   to the order of the good.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.120]   It's not sovereign.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.520]   It doesn't reign sovereignly over being
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.760]   and it makes its own decisions.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:15.080]   So I think Casey was terrible law
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.720]   and it was backing up Roe v. Wade, which is terrible law.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.880]   So I'm in favor of the overturning of those.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.560]   I've spoken out that many times.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.600]   Now it'll return it to the individual states.
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.760]   It's not gonna solve the problem.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.800]   The individual states will have to decide.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.320]   I just heard yesterday, we were up in Sacramento,
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:35.160]   the bishops having our annual meeting.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.920]   And so we got the word from the governor and the legislators
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.120]   that they're gonna push for a constitutional amendment
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:41.960]   in California.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.760]   So basically to make any attempt to limit abortion
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.680]   in any way, just illegal.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.120]   I think that's barbaric.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.920]   So I stand radically opposed to that.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:54.120]   - It's such an interesting line
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:57.680]   because if you believe that there's a,
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:00.720]   it's a line that struggles with the question
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.720]   of what does it mean to be a living being
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.220]   or to give life to something.
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:12.520]   Because if you believe that at the moment of conception,
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.760]   you're basically creating a human life,
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:18.360]   then abortion is murder.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.880]   And then if you don't,
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:26.160]   then it's a sort of basic biological choice
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:30.360]   that's not taking away of a life.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.240]   And the gap between those two beliefs is so vast
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.760]   that it's hard and yet so fundamental
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.980]   to the question of what it means to be alive
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:43.360]   and the fundamental question about the respect
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.840]   for human life and human dignity.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.340]   It's interesting to see.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:51.160]   And also about freedom too.
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.880]   All of those things are mixed in there.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.360]   It's a beautiful struggle.
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.320]   - Maybe the freedom is the most important.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:58.960]   The sort of freedom run amuck.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.600]   In classical philosophy and theology,
[01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:07.660]   freedom is not self-determination.
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:12.660]   Freedom is the disciplining of desire
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.820]   so as to make the achievement of the good
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:19.480]   first possible and then effortless.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.320]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.560]   So modern freedom, and the roots of that
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.140]   are people like William of Ockham in the late Middle Ages.
[01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:28.320]   Freedom means I hover above the yes and the no.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.240]   Do I do yes or no?
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.840]   And I'm the sovereign subject of that choice.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.420]   And on no basis I will say yes or no.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.480]   I'm like Louis XIV, or I'm like Stalin or something.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.760]   But Aquinas wouldn't have recognized that as freedom.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.960]   For him, it's I got this desire in me.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.720]   I've got this will.
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.360]   And it's pushing toward the good.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.240]   But the trouble is I got so many attachments
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.720]   and I'm so stupid and I'm so conditioned by my sin
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.240]   that I can't achieve it.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.480]   So I need to be disciplined in my desire
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.840]   so as to make that achievement possible
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.360]   and then effortless.
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:07.920]   So right now, I'm freely speaking English to you.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.320]   And you had the experience, and I've had it too,
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.760]   of learning a foreign language.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.080]   And don't you feel unfree?
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.720]   Like when you're struggling with a language.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.560]   When I was over in Paris doing my doctoral work,
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.480]   and I was okay with French.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.640]   But my first time in a seminar,
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:27.080]   and there's all these intelligent francophones
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.440]   around the table, and they're all just,
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.160]   and I'm trying to say my little thing in my awkward French.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:37.160]   And I felt unfree, 'cause my desire wasn't,
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.040]   it wasn't directed.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.040]   But then over time, I became freer and freer
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.480]   speaker of French.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:47.000]   I was ordered more to the good.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.640]   That's a better understanding of freedom
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:51.560]   than sort of sovereign self-determination.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.720]   But our country is now, I think,
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.920]   really in the grip of that.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.760]   I decide.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.920]   And that's where the Nietzschean thing comes to my mind,
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.280]   the will to power.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.920]   I'm beyond good and evil.
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.960]   It's just up to me to decide.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.360]   God help us.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.120]   No, it's the values that we intuit around us,
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:11.000]   intellectual, moral, and aesthetic, the values.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.680]   Think of the dog on the beach again.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.380]   And that you get ordered to those by your education,
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.660]   by your family, by your religion.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:19.560]   And that's beautiful.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.680]   That makes you free.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:23.160]   Now I can freely enter into this.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.160]   So this sovereign self-determination business,
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.140]   that's not my game.
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:31.520]   - The values come in part from the tradition
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:33.600]   carried through the generations.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.720]   Let me ask you to put on your wise hat
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.400]   and give advice to young folks.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:40.320]   So high school and college,
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:45.480]   thinking about what to do with their life, career.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:48.600]   There's so many options out there.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:52.000]   How can they have a career they can be proud of,
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.500]   or even just a life they can be proud of?
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:46:00.440]   - I think I'd say find something you're good at,
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.620]   because that's from God.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:03.720]   It's a gift that God's given you.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:06.120]   And then dedicate it to love.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:06.960]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.200]   So you're good at science or math or sports or whatever.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.880]   Okay, I'm gonna use that now for my aggrandizement,
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.560]   for my wealth, for my privileges, and to become famous.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:19.000]   No, no, no, don't.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.400]   Find what you're good at,
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:23.800]   but now dedicate it to willing the good of the other.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:26.060]   So use your science and use your mathematics
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:29.080]   and use your sports and use your musicianship
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.260]   to benefit the world, you know?
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:33.880]   That's what I'd say to them.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.080]   So find what you're good at.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.400]   That's from God. - Well, that's a tricky one,
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:39.040]   finding what you're good at,
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.440]   because it's not just raw skill.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.560]   It's also what you connect with.
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:48.240]   And it's also this iterative process of,
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.500]   if you wanna add love to the world,
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:55.640]   you have to see how can you be effective at doing that.
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:57.120]   So it's not just the things you're good at.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:02.120]   There's like, I'm good at building bridges out of toothpicks.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:05.920]   I'm not exactly sure that's going to be useful for the world.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.840]   Then again, to push back on that,
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:11.360]   the joy brings me, maybe somehow the joy radiates out.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.200]   - Yeah, but you're good at what you're doing right now,
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.240]   and you've dedicated that to bringing more light
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:19.440]   and illumination and joy to the world.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.280]   (Lex laughs)
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.120]   - But it's true.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:24.360]   - But that was a searching, that's a process
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:26.720]   of trying stuff and figuring it out.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:27.560]   - Right.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.760]   - And ultimately, yes, asking the question,
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.640]   how is this making the world at all better
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:34.680]   at every step of the way,
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.000]   as opposed to enriching yourself
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.120]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.200]   - Right, I think that's the name of the game.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.160]   But it's tricky, and if we don't have moral mentors
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.560]   and intellectual mentors, it becomes hard.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:47.280]   And if you tell a kid, that's deadly to me,
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:50.240]   just decide for yourself, just off you go,
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.760]   and you make your own choices.
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.440]   Now, your choice has to be disciplined.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.520]   Your desire's gotta be directed.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:59.680]   Then you'll find your creative path.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.600]   Everyone does it in his own way.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.840]   But it's a guided choice.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.040]   Your freedom is not sovereign, it's a guided freedom.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.440]   - So in the struggle and the suffering
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.680]   you've seen in the world,
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:16.940]   let me ask you the question of death.
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:22.720]   How often do you think about your own mortality?
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.920]   - Every day.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.920]   - And one, are you afraid of it, the uncertainty of it?
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:32.440]   And what do you think happens after you die?
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:33.280]   - Sure, I'm afraid of it,
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.920]   I mean, 'cause I don't know what's next.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.880]   I mean, I can't know it the way I know you,
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.560]   so of course I'm afraid of it.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.480]   And I think of it every day.
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:44.320]   That's true.
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:48.200]   My prayer life compels me.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:51.000]   You know, we have this, the Hail Mary prayer.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.520]   You know, so you pray the rosary.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.280]   Now and at the hour of our death, amen.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.720]   Now and at the hour of our death, amen.
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.040]   Now at the hour of our death, amen.
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:00.840]   You pray the whole rosary, 50 times.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:03.400]   You've reminded yourself of your own death.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:05.160]   But I do, I think about it,
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.400]   because it's the ultimate limit.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.920]   It's why it's beguiled every artist and writer
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.560]   and philosopher, it's the ultimate limit question.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:16.760]   But yeah, sure, I'm afraid of it, 'cause it's the unknown.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.240]   What do I think happens?
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:25.140]   I think I'm drawn into the deeper embrace of God's love.
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:28.060]   You know, and that's stating it
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:30.020]   kind of in a more poetic way.
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:32.620]   Do you know John Polkinghorne's work?
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:33.740]   Do you know that name?
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.940]   John Polkinghorne was a very interesting,
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.380]   he just died recently.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:39.820]   He was a Cambridge University particle physicist, right?
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:41.860]   High, high-level scientist,
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:45.260]   who at midlife became an Anglican priest.
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:47.660]   He left his job at Cambridge and went to the seminary
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:49.460]   and became an Anglican priest, right?
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:51.420]   And then wrote, I think, some of the best stuff
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.740]   on science and religion, 'cause he really knew the science
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:54.900]   from the inside.
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:56.100]   Here's Polkinghorne's account
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:58.740]   that I've always found persuasive.
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:03.220]   He said, "What survives after we die?"
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:06.700]   So this body clearly dies and goes into the ground
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.140]   or it's burned up or it goes away, right?
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:10.140]   "But what's preserved?"
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:13.460]   And he says, what Aristotle would have called the form,
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.220]   Polkinghorne calls it the pattern.
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.420]   So the pattern that's organized,
[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.980]   the matter that's made me up over all these years,
[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:23.380]   that's obviously not the same as it was,
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.700]   even, I mean, you would know, how often does it all change,
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:28.340]   all your atoms and cells and, you know.
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:31.260]   There was the little Bobby Barron
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:33.700]   who was growing up in Birmingham, Michigan,
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.940]   I can have a picture of him, and then there's me.
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.340]   And I say, oh, that's the same person.
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:39.260]   Well, I mean, clearly not, materially speaking,
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:41.740]   not at all, completely different.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.580]   But there's a unity to whatever that pattern is
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:48.060]   by which all of that materiality's been kind of organized.
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:49.900]   So Polkinghorne says,
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:54.180]   I think that pattern is remembered by God.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:57.020]   And remember's the wrong word, it's like derivative.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.620]   I mean, it's known by God.
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:03.460]   And so God can therefore re-embody me,
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:06.460]   according to that pattern, at a higher pitch,
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.180]   what we call the resurrected body.
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:12.260]   So Paul talks about a spiritual body.
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:14.020]   Body, for sure, because he believes
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.460]   in the resurrection of Jesus.
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:19.500]   But it's not a body like ours from this world.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:22.060]   It's a body at a higher pitch.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:26.140]   - So something, some pattern that's there persists.
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:28.620]   - Pattern persists in the mind of God
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:32.420]   and then is used as the ground of the re-embodiment of me.
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:35.540]   So it's not like I've just become a platonic form.
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:36.740]   I'm gonna be re-embodied,
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:41.080]   because the Christian hope is not for platonic escape
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.280]   of soul from matter.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.820]   That's never the Christian hope.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:46.900]   It's for the resurrection of the body, we say.
[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.940]   And you say, what a fantastic idea.
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:49.900]   Well, I don't know.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:53.500]   I mean, this body is being reconstituted all the time,
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.460]   according to this pattern, right?
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:57.140]   It's not the same matter.
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:02.140]   And so might there be another sort of higher material
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:04.920]   that is organized according to the same pattern,
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.620]   which has been remembered by God?
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:08.300]   So therefore we can hang on to the language
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:11.860]   of body and soul, if you want, or matter and form.
[01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:14.560]   But it's the form remembered by God
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:18.060]   and then reconstituted in an embodied way by God
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:21.340]   that we call heaven, the heavenly state.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:22.660]   That's what I hope for.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:25.960]   That's my Christian faith, my Christian hope.
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:29.780]   - Let me ask you about the big question of meaning.
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:32.320]   We've talked about it in different directions,
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:33.740]   from different perspectives.
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:36.860]   What's the meaning of our existence here on earth?
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:39.320]   What's the meaning of life?
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.500]   - Love.
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.220]   God is love.
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:45.000]   And the purpose of my life is to become God's friend.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.260]   And that means I'm more conformed to love.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.580]   And so my life finds meaning in the measure
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:52.940]   that I become more on fire with the divine love.
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.060]   I'm like the burning bush.
[01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:55.900]   It's to become more and more radiant
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:57.580]   with the presence of God.
[01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:59.700]   That's what gives life meaning.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.900]   Meaning is to live in a purposive relationship
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:03.120]   to a value, I would say.
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:04.860]   So there's all kinds of values.
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:07.700]   As I say, moral, aesthetic, intellectual values.
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:09.220]   And when I have a purposive relationship,
[01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:10.700]   I'm like, so right now you and I,
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:12.740]   we have a purposive relationship to the value of,
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.460]   let's say, finding out the truth of things,
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:18.020]   and we're speaking together to seek that.
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:19.140]   Well, good.
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:20.340]   What's the ultimate value?
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.300]   The value of values is God.
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:23.720]   The supreme good, right?
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:27.900]   The supremely knowable, the supremely intelligible is God.
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:30.100]   And so to be conformed to God
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:32.460]   is to have a fully meaningful life.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:33.780]   And who's God?
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:34.900]   God is love.
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:38.020]   So that's where I would fit the package together that way.
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:41.180]   - You're adding a lot of love to this world,
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:43.260]   and which is something I deeply appreciate,
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:45.780]   and that you would sit down with me,
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:48.100]   given how valuable your time is, is a huge honor.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:48.940]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:49.760]   - Well, my great pleasure.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.540]   I loved it, Lex, thank you.
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:53.060]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.620]   with Bishop Robert Barron.

[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.060]   from Bishop Robert Barron himself,
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:05.540]   which reminds me of the Dostoevsky line
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:07.540]   spoken through Prince Mishkin,
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:10.780]   that quote, "Beauty will save the world."
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:14.660]   Robert says, "Begin with the beautiful,
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:19.660]   "which leads to the good, which leads you to truth."
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:22.940]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:25.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.100]   (upbeat music)
