[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   to our eighth class meeting
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.560]   of Intermediate Biblical Counseling.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.360]   And I trust that you're doing well in the Lord
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.040]   and that God is blessing your studies
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.480]   and drawing you near to him
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.640]   as you study his precious word.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.360]   And tonight we have the opportunity
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.840]   to look at theology exam number eight,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.060]   which is an exam focused on the attributes of God.
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.840]   And I think it's just gonna be a good time for us
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.160]   to study God's word and to think about the truths
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.840]   of who God is.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960]   And I trust that this will be a encouragement
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.080]   and a blessing to each of you tonight.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.520]   To introduce our study for tonight,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.320]   I'd like to do a devotional
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.040]   from one of my favorite passages in scripture,
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   which is Lamentations chapter three, verses 21 to 26.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.960]   And I hope this will be both a good devotional thought
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.000]   and encouragement for us.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.920]   And also an introduction to how the attributes of God
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.360]   can be used in counseling
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.920]   and why this essay topic is so important
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.760]   for our understanding.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.400]   So this is Lamentations chapter three, starting in verse 21.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120]   And I'm gonna go ahead and put this on the screen there.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.420]   Lamentations three, starting in verse 21.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.520]   The prophet Jeremiah says,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.820]   "But this I call to mind and therefore I have hope.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.500]   The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.260]   His mercies never come to an end.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.900]   They are new every morning.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.500]   Great is your faithfulness.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.460]   The Lord is my portion, says my soul.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.680]   Therefore I will hope in him.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.980]   The Lord is good to those who wait for him.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980]   To the soul who seeks him,
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.820]   it is good that one should wait quietly
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.500]   for the salvation of the Lord."
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.960]   And that's a wonderful passage from God's word.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.760]   But if you know the book of Lamentations,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.620]   you know that this passage is found
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.800]   smack dab in the middle of a lot of weeping,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.320]   a lot of sorrow, a lot of grieving
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.540]   and lamenting over the destruction of Jerusalem.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.820]   The prophet Jeremiah is known as the weeping prophet.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.540]   He ministered just prior to the Babylonian captivity
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.660]   in 586 BC.
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.560]   And his eyes witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.180]   in the Babylonian captivity.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.060]   And he writes the book of Lamentations
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.060]   to express his sorrow over the destruction of Jerusalem
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.980]   and the captivity of his people.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.280]   And if you've read this book,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.100]   you know that it's filled with really a lament
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.060]   over all that has happened to God's people,
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.140]   but it's written in a very disciplined manner.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.340]   Jeremiah uses the form of an acrostic,
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.620]   a Hebrew acrostic to write these laments.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.640]   And so it's not just undisciplined venting of emotion,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   but it is a very disciplined and organized expression
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.760]   of Jeremiah's grief and his sorrow over all that he has seen.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.440]   And then smack dab in the middle of all of this grieving
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.720]   and lamenting, we have this amazing passage of hope
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   and remembrance of the truth of who God is.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.760]   And Jeremiah says in verse 21,
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.380]   "But this I call to mind and therefore I have hope."
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.820]   That's an amazing statement there
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820]   that Jeremiah can have hope in the middle
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.820]   of so much calamity, so much loss of life,
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.720]   so much national struggle.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.980]   And here we are in the lowest point of Judah's history.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.400]   And Jeremiah says, "But this I call to mind
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.680]   and therefore I have hope."
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.540]   You notice what he says in verse 21.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.780]   He says, "This I call to mind."
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.380]   And so here we have the prophet Jeremiah
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.820]   making a conscious, willful decision
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.860]   to set his mind on certain truths of who God is.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.240]   And the therefore in verse 21 is very important.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.180]   It's because Jeremiah made that choice
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.500]   to call to mind the truths of who God is,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.100]   that he was able to have hope
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.100]   in the midst of these very difficult circumstances.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.220]   What are the truths that Jeremiah calls to mind?
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.500]   Verse 22, he calls to mind the steadfast love of the Lord.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.300]   He says, "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases."
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.900]   The Hebrew term chesed, which is almost a term
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.980]   that is untranslatable in the English language
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.980]   'cause it combines the idea of covenant faithfulness,
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.660]   loyalty, kindness, love, and mercy.
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.820]   The King James Version has the translation loving kindness,
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.220]   trying to capture something of the meaning of this term,
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.300]   combining love and kindness and faithfulness and loyalty.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.700]   That's the idea of the steadfast love of the Lord.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.600]   He says, "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases."
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.100]   Then he calls to mind the mercy of God.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.180]   He says, "His mercies never come to an end."
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.920]   You notice the plural there.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   It's not singular mercy, it's plural mercies,
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.060]   talking about the manifold nature of God's abundant mercies,
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.800]   mercy for every circumstance, mercy for every trial.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.640]   His mercies never come to an end.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.020]   One commentator writes that the word mercy signifies
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.220]   a warm compassion, a compassion which is ready
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.220]   to forgive sin, to replace judgment with grace.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.180]   And Paul Tripp has a devotional
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.940]   that's called "New Morning Mercies."
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.660]   I would highly recommend that for you.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.380]   We use that in our counseling ministry
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.260]   to give to our counselees, just to get them thinking
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.900]   about the truth of who God is.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.120]   And he writes in that devotional,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.620]   "God's mercies don't come in one color.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.800]   "No, they come in every shade of every color
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.260]   "of the rainbow of his grace.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.380]   "Remember God's new morning mercies
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.380]   "and celebrate your identity as the object of mercy."
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:20.340]   So here Jeremiah is in the most devastating season
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.740]   of Judah's history.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.680]   And he says, "God's mercies never come to an end.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.740]   "They are new every morning."
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.340]   And then he calls to mind,
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.500]   not only the steadfast love of the Lord,
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.160]   not only the mercy of the Lord,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.560]   but he calls to mind the faithfulness of God.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.820]   And he says, "Great is your faithfulness."
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.640]   The term great is describing the faithfulness of God
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.240]   in terms of its massive size.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.800]   It's almost as if Jeremiah is comparing
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   the circumstances of life to the massive dimensions
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   of God's faithfulness and showing how any circumstance,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.920]   no matter how intimidating,
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   is really pales in significance to the greatness,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.160]   the magnitude, the size of God's faithfulness.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.960]   And he calls to mind these three attributes of God.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.000]   So there's three attributes of God in this passage,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.200]   the love of the Lord, or the loving kindness of the Lord,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   the mercy of the Lord, and the faithfulness of the Lord.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.760]   And it's Jeremiah's, again, it's his conscious,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.420]   willful decision in verse 21, "This I will call to mind."
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.200]   So I'm not gonna get lost
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.400]   in only looking at the circumstances.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.960]   I'm not gonna get lost in only analyzing
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.360]   the situation at hand,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.760]   but I will call to mind the attributes of God,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.720]   and therefore I have hope.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.080]   The attributes of God, if properly understood,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   give the believer hope in the middle of the most difficult
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.340]   and distressing of circumstances.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.380]   So the result is, in verse 24, Jeremiah says,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.160]   "The Lord is my portion," says my soul.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.580]   "Therefore, I will hope in him."
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.560]   The idea of a portion, it's really a simple way
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.800]   of Jeremiah saying, "The Lord is enough for me.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.080]   "I'm satisfied in him."
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.680]   He goes on to say, "The Lord is good
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.680]   "to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him."
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.780]   And then verse 26, "It is good that one should wait quietly
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.580]   "for the salvation of the Lord."
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.240]   That's an amazing statement there.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   The quiet waiting of the believer who places his hope
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.800]   in a God who is loving and faithful and merciful,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   he says, "I will wait quietly for the Lord to save."
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.920]   And I just can't help but make an observation
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.960]   from our day to day.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   We live in a world of noisy hearts.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.560]   I think you know that well.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.880]   I think this season has really brought out
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.000]   a lot of noise in the world and in society,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.640]   and people are expressing their noisy hearts
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   through noisy words and noisy social media posts.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.800]   And here you have the example of a believer
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.240]   who knows who his God is.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.840]   And he says that, "I will wait quietly
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.600]   "for the salvation of the Lord."
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   As I've said before, the trusting heart is a quiet heart,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.720]   and a quiet heart is a strong heart.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.920]   And this is where Jeremiah is, "I will wait quietly."
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:35.120]   So here you have national crisis, economic devastation.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.280]   You have a divided kingdom.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.480]   Northern tribes have already been taken into captivity,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.720]   into Assyria in 722 BC.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.520]   And then you have the Southern tribe of Judah
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.680]   taken captive in 586 BC by the Babylonians.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.820]   You have a divided nation.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.000]   You have physical devastation, death.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.900]   And you have real grief and real sorrow.
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.680]   So this passage doesn't take away anything
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.680]   from the real lament and sorrow that Jeremiah is expressing.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.380]   But in the midst of all of that, Jeremiah says,
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.380]   "I have hope, and I have hope because I know who God is.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.980]   "And I have hope because this is what I'm going to
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.260]   "call to mind, is I'm gonna call to mind
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:39.260]   "the steadfast love of the Lord, which never ceases."
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.900]   And so I think you and I need to apply this
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.180]   to our own hearts and our own lives tonight.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:52.240]   I think we see in this passage
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.360]   how powerful the attributes of God are.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.600]   I mean, these are just three of the attributes of God.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.240]   I mean, there are more attributes,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.640]   but Jeremiah just calls to mind three attributes of God
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.620]   and the power, the effect upon his soul.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.080]   It replaces despair with hope.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.820]   It replaces noise with a quiet trust
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.920]   and waiting in the Lord.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.940]   And Jeremiah's sorrow turns to a confident expectation,
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:30.140]   which is what hope is, a confident expectation
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.080]   in God's future activity that will bless his people.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.460]   And if Jeremiah could say that
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.660]   in the midst of the destruction of Jerusalem,
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.900]   then I think you and I as believers can apply that
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.880]   to our own hearts in the struggles
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.340]   and the trials that our nation is facing today.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.780]   So let me pray for us,
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.440]   and we'll get into our study for tonight.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.280]   Let's pray.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.060]   Well, Father, we do call this to mind
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:04.060]   that you are a God who is a God of covenant loyalty
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.960]   to your people.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.220]   Your loving kindness endures forever.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.300]   Your mercies are new every morning.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.780]   Your faithfulness is from generation to generation.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.080]   And we thank you that those circumstances change
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.660]   and those seasons change,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.980]   that your character never changes.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.620]   You are the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.000]   You are immutable, unchanging.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.060]   You do not change for the better because that is impossible.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.460]   You are perfect, and perfection cannot be improved upon,
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.780]   and you never change for the worse
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.500]   because there is no way for you to lose your perfection.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.920]   You are forever loving, forever faithful,
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.120]   forever merciful, forever kind, forever holy.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.100]   And we just rejoice in the truth
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.100]   that though life does bring us very difficult
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.260]   and devastating circumstances,
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.180]   that we can have hope because we know who our God is.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.820]   And so we just pray that, Father, our study tonight
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.540]   and the writing of this essay, Theology Exam Number Eight,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.360]   would have this blessed and beneficial effect
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.480]   upon our souls,
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.520]   and that we would not only write a great essay,
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   but that we would be equipped to use the attributes of God
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.600]   in counseling others and also in counseling our own hearts
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.460]   as we seek to walk through these difficult times together.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.620]   Thank you for each student in this class
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.800]   who have devoted themselves to the study of your word.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.240]   Bless each one, and may this time result
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.840]   in much fruit for your glory,
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.580]   and we pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.660]   Amen.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:12.800]   Well, I hope you see from that brief devotional
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.120]   that the study of the attributes of God
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.240]   are relevant for everyday life.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.380]   This is not some ivory tower topic.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.460]   This is something that needs to be applied
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.460]   in the everyday situations that we face.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.660]   And I also hope that you see that the attributes of God
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.400]   are relevant for counseling.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:39.660]   Counseling is using God's word to minister to people,
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.500]   and one of the great arsenals of truth
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.980]   that you have at your disposal as a biblical counselor
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.660]   is the attributes of God.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.620]   These are truths that you want to use
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.800]   and be well acquainted with.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.380]   You want to really be able to, as we saw in Jeremiah's case,
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.260]   use the attributes of God to give people hope.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.220]   And we'll talk through some examples of how to do that.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.940]   But tonight's study is a very practical study.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.260]   Let me read the exam topic for us,
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.320]   and then we'll talk a little bit more about this subject.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.860]   So the exam question is explain
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.260]   each of the following attributes of God,
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.020]   describing the practical implications
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.300]   of each attribute for life and counseling.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.700]   And then there are six attributes
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.180]   they're asking you to write about.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:43.180]   Wrath, mercy, holiness, omnipotence,
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.080]   omniscience, and omnipresence.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.960]   So we have wrath, mercy, holiness,
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.880]   So best of luck to you all
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.480]   to get all that in in a page and a half.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.460]   That is probably the most challenging part
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.460]   of writing this essay is talking about six attributes of God
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.820]   and getting that in under a page and a half.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.020]   Obviously, we're asking you to be very concise.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.140]   We're asking you to give really a brief definition,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.060]   a little bit of scriptural support.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.600]   And then the essay is asking you to describe
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.700]   the practical implications of each attribute
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.880]   for life and counseling.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   And so you'll want to do one or two practical implications.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.320]   I don't know how much more you can really do on that
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.860]   and fit within the space constraints of this essay,
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.440]   but that's gonna be a challenge
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.620]   to get all that in under a page and a half.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.760]   But rest assured, it can be done by God's grace
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.720]   and it has been done by a number of students,
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.200]   but that is gonna be a challenge
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.840]   to get all that in under a page and a half.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.560]   If you look at your handout there,
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.480]   I have on page number one,
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.640]   some good resources that you can use to write this essay.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.200]   We have Paul Enns, "The Moody Handbook of Theology,"
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.280]   pages 193 to 203.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.000]   And he's good on practically any topic,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.360]   very concise and well distilled information.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.040]   Then you have Wayne Grudem, "Systematic Theology."
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.520]   Grudem's "Systematic Theology"
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.400]   is excellent on the attributes of God.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.000]   I think he has two to three chapters
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.720]   on the attributes of God,
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.040]   and it's just excellent information,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   very well articulated and well summarized.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.480]   So you'll definitely wanna take a look
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   at Wayne Grudem's "Systematic Theology."
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.680]   Then we have Heath Lambert's,
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.840]   "A Theology of Biblical Counseling."
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.400]   Dr. Lambert's work is really helpful
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.200]   in showing how you would use the attributes of God
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.800]   in a counseling session.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.120]   I think he has some case studies
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.520]   in his work, "A Theology of Biblical Counseling,"
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.120]   and he shows how you would use
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.840]   these different attributes of God to encourage
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.400]   or to give hope to a believer who is in despair
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.600]   or just struggling with sin.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.720]   So that's a really good work.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.040]   I would recommend that you read that as well.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.800]   And then I have A.W. Pink's, "The Attributes of God,"
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.520]   and A.W. Tozer's, "The Knowledge of the Holy,"
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.280]   and some selected chapters,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.120]   which are targeted toward the six attributes
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.400]   that we're asking you to write about.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   And those two works are just phenomenal, both of them.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.920]   I'd encourage you to maybe use Tozer's work
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.400]   as a devotional aid and just take a chapter a day
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.320]   and read through that because it really is
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.000]   a wonderful treatment on the attributes of God
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.440]   and A.W. Pink's work as well.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.040]   And then some favorites of mine
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.920]   that I just recommend to you for general reading.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.600]   There's R.C. Sproul's, "The Holiness of God."
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.200]   That's a fantastic read.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.400]   If you haven't gotten your hands on that yet,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.440]   please do so and just read that for your own soul
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.880]   to remind yourself of the greatness of who God is.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.600]   And then obviously, J.I. Packer's, "Knowing God,"
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.220]   is a classic.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.600]   That's just a standard work
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.700]   that all of us should be acquainted with.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.280]   And if you really wanna go deep into this subject,
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.720]   pick up Stephen Charnock's,
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.400]   "The Existence and Attributes of God."
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.480]   You can get that for free online.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.240]   I believe that's a public domain at this point.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.880]   And that'll be, you'll get lost in that one.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.840]   You can go as deep as you wanna go,
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.120]   and it's just a fantastic read
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.880]   and encourage you to pick that up.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.560]   If you don't read through that page by page,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.400]   just use it as a reference for certain attributes
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.640]   if you wanna go deeper in your understanding.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.300]   So those are just some general resources
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.080]   that I would recommend to you.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.060]   Now, if you move to page two of your handout,
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.920]   just some introductory statements
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.620]   on the attributes of God.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:27.680]   I think A.W. Tozer said it really well when he said,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.440]   "What comes into our minds when we think about God
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   "is the most important thing about us."
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.160]   What comes into our minds when we think about God
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   is the most important thing about us.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.320]   Now, Tozer didn't write that
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.360]   in a biblical counseling textbook,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.520]   but he might as well have.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.960]   It's a statement that is really relevant
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.300]   to biblical counseling.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.280]   You could maybe revise that a little bit
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.160]   and say what comes into your counselee's mind
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.280]   when your counselee thinks about God
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.660]   is the most important thing about that person.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.840]   Really, what comes into your counselee's mind
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.280]   when he or she thinks about God
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.360]   has relevance to the counseling situation.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.800]   So you'll remember my presentation
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.980]   of a typical counseling issue.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.520]   Here you have a counselee who is expressing himself
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   or herself in certain words, actions, and emotions.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.180]   And we said that a secular psychologist
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:48.080]   under common grace can make accurate observations
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.500]   on this external behavior.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.960]   What is this counselee saying?
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.340]   What are they doing?
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.840]   What is the external behavior
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.880]   that is being expressed by this counselee?
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.860]   A secular psychologist and a biblical counselor
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.700]   will most likely make very similar observations
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.560]   about external behavior.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.280]   But what a secular psychologist cannot do
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.280]   is understand the source of this type of behavior.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.340]   Where is this behavior coming from?
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:29.440]   And so we have built an understanding
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.820]   through year one and also year two
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.320]   that scripture says the source of human behavior
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.120]   is what is going on in the heart.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.440]   It is out of the heart, the flow, the springs of life,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.540]   Proverbs 4, verse 23 says.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.480]   And the heart is expressing itself
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.980]   in these external behaviors.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.280]   But as a biblical counselor,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.280]   we also see that the heart is relating always to God.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:04.240]   The heart is always relating either wrongly or rightly
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.100]   to the true and the living God.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   The heart is always relating either in a godly manner
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.920]   to who God is or an ungodly manner to who God is.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.880]   And so a biblical counselor is called
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.320]   not only to make accurate observations
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.800]   about words, actions, and emotions,
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   but also to make right interpretations
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.360]   of how the heart is relating either rightly
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.660]   or wrongly to God.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.400]   That was indictment of Jesus toward the Pharisees
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.080]   in Matthew 15, verse eight, where he said,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.720]   "This people honors me with their lips,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.800]   "but their heart is far from me."
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.640]   And so when the heart is far from God,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.140]   when the heart is not worshiping God and treasuring God,
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:02.600]   then you have aberrant words, actions, and emotions.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.880]   You have ungodly behavior that comes out
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.620]   of that wrong heart dynamic
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.840]   that the heart is relating wrongly to God.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.600]   And if you want any more confirmation of that,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.160]   read Romans 1, verse 18,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.600]   all the way to the end of that chapter.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.680]   You'll find that when the heart does not worship
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.760]   the true and the living God,
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.880]   that all sorts of aberrant behaviors come out
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.040]   of that heart dynamic.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   So when we are deficient in our understanding
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.680]   of who God is, then we respond in an ungodly manner
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.280]   to our circumstances.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.480]   So going back to Tozer's statement,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.760]   what comes into our minds when we think about God
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.120]   is the most important thing about us.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.400]   We want to help our counselees understand
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.680]   the attributes of God.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.980]   This is, I think, one of the most helpful,
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.120]   practical things in counseling ministry
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.400]   is whenever you're in doubt, you don't know what to do,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.980]   go to the attributes of God.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.520]   I mean, you just can't go wrong with this.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.760]   You can't go wrong by, and by that,
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.360]   I don't mean pull out 20 attributes of God
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.480]   and make your counselee memorize all 20.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.900]   Really, in practical counseling ministry,
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.920]   if you pull out one attribute of God
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.200]   and just encourage your counselee with that attribute
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.160]   or two to three attributes of God
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   and just help your counselee see the faithfulness of God
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.520]   or help your counselee see the sovereignty of God
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.300]   or help your counselee see the love of God.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.020]   I mean, any one of those attributes
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.840]   will have a beneficial effect
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.480]   upon the soul for your counselee.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.560]   And you just have this arsenal of truth here
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.080]   to impart help and hope to your counselee.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.680]   And that's sort of one of my go-tos
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.720]   if I don't know what to do.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.840]   You never go wrong going to the attributes of God
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.480]   and using that in counseling ministry.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.760]   Some of these statements that theologians have made
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.800]   on the attributes of God just kind of explode
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.340]   with significance for counseling ministry.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.580]   I know that C.H. Spurgeon was not teaching
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.220]   in a biblical counseling class,
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.660]   but just listen to what he said about the attributes of God.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.040]   He said, "There is something exceedingly improving
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.300]   "to the mind in a contemplation of the divinity.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.100]   "It is a subject so vast that all of our thoughts
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.120]   "are lost in its immensity."
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.580]   This is just perfect for biblical counseling.
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.620]   He says, "Would you lose your sorrow?
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.920]   "Would you drown your cares?
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.600]   "Then go plunge yourself in the Godhead's deepest sea.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.540]   "Be lost in its immensity and you shall come forth
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.140]   "as from a couch of rest, refreshed and invigorated."
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.500]   In counseling, we are working with people
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.500]   who are overcome with sorrow or overcome with cares
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.140]   who need refreshment from God's word.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.960]   And Spurgeon says, "There's no better place to go
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.600]   "than the attributes of God."
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.460]   He says, "I know nothing which can so comfort the soul,
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.240]   "so calm the swelling billows of sorrow and grief,
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.620]   "so speak peace to the winds of trial
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.980]   "as the devout musing upon the subject of the Godhead."
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:39.100]   That just has so much implications for counseling ministry
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.940]   because we are ministering to people
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.460]   who are dealing with just that,
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.040]   the sorrow and the grief of life.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.060]   And then Packer's statement,
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.060]   "A study of the nature and the character of God
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:58.060]   "is the most practical project anyone can engage in."
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.440]   And then watch this, he says,
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.940]   "The world becomes a strange, mad, painful place
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.560]   "and life in it is disappointing and unpleasant business
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.820]   "for those who do not know about God."
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.980]   I mean, that's the world today, isn't it?
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.020]   They're just trying to interpret
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.440]   all of what's happening in our nation
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.100]   apart from an understanding of the true and the living God.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:32.020]   And the world has become a strange, mad, painful place.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.980]   But for those of us who know our God,
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.940]   there ought to be a different understanding
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.900]   of the events in our day.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.620]   Again, doesn't remove the sorrow,
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.220]   doesn't remove the true grief that happens in this life,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.580]   but there is a different perspective
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.860]   that we must bring to bear upon the issues of life
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.940]   because we do know our God and we do know who he is.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.660]   Packer continues, "Disregard the study of God
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.400]   "and you sentence yourself to stumble and blunder
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.020]   "through life, blindfolded as it were,
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.640]   "with no sense of direction
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.620]   "and no understanding of what surrounds you.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.460]   "Knowing about God is crucially important
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.140]   "for the living of our lives."
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:26.980]   So I talked about how in counseling ministry,
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.260]   it's not that you take 20 attributes of God
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.600]   and just overload your counselee
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.560]   with theological information.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   It really is many times one or two attributes of God
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.980]   or even using a narrative in scripture
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.900]   to highlight the truth of God's faithfulness
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.000]   and his sovereignty.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.980]   And one example of how we do this
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.420]   is in Jerry Bridges' work, "Trusting God,"
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.420]   which is I think one of the go-to counseling resources
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.860]   that we use in our counseling ministry.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.300]   He has both the book, "Trusting God,"
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.460]   and he also has a pamphlet, "You Can Trust God,"
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.700]   which we have in our counseling library.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.220]   And essentially in that book, "Trusting God,"
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.500]   Jerry Bridges takes three attributes of God
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.500]   and uses those three attributes to minister help and hope
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.900]   to people who are struggling with the issues of life.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.500]   So he takes the sovereignty of God,
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.360]   God's complete control over all creation,
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.980]   including God's complete control
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.720]   over every circumstance in our lives.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.460]   He takes the wisdom of God,
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.460]   which is the idea that God ordains the best ends
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.660]   and then ordains the best means to achieve those ends.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.740]   Every circumstance in our life
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.940]   is an expression of the wisdom of God
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.820]   that he has a goal in mind.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:11.820]   And that goal is the best goal that is possibly conceivable.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:17.780]   And the circumstance that is ordained for our lives
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.780]   is the best means to achieve that ultimate end.
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.960]   And then he has the love of God, God's love for his people,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.260]   that God will always ordain the best ends for his people
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:38.020]   because of his infinite love for us.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.500]   And he talks about this idea that we need to warm up
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.640]   the doctrine of the sovereignty of God
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.500]   with the doctrine of the wisdom of God and the love of God,
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.780]   that it's not just cold sovereignty
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.380]   that we need to minister to people,
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.280]   but it's the idea of God's sovereignty
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.140]   coupled with his wisdom and his love
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:04.560]   that brings comfort to God's people.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.020]   If you believe that God is on his throne
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:12.240]   and he's completely ruling over this universe,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:18.020]   that there is no maverick molecule in the entire universe,
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.920]   as R.C. Sproul says,
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.980]   that everything is under his complete control,
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.340]   if you believe that he is infinitely wise
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.780]   and everything that is happening today
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.780]   is part of his wise plan to glorify himself
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.540]   and to do good to his people,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.660]   and if you believe that God loves his people
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.820]   with an infinite love
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.860]   and that everything that he has ordained
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.260]   is an expression of his perfect
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.000]   and infinite love for his people,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.280]   then the result, as Bridges says, is you can trust God.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.720]   You can trust this God.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.720]   You can release control, as it were, of your life
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.280]   to a God who is in complete control,
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.680]   and you can place your life in his hands.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.640]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.160]   and lean not on your own understanding.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.240]   In all your ways, acknowledge him,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.040]   and he will make straight your paths.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.140]   If this is the God that you believe in,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.800]   then you can trust him.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   And as Jeremiah said, you can wait quietly for him
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:32.120]   to do his work in your life for your good and for his glory.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:38.720]   Again, those are just three attributes.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.280]   I mean, there are so many more
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.560]   that you could use to comfort and encourage people,
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:48.080]   but that's the power of just the attributes of God.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.480]   Here you have three attributes of God,
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.920]   and Bridges builds an entire book around this,
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:59.960]   and the power of this to minister to the heart
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.800]   so that the believer can trust God
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.920]   in the midst of very trying circumstances.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.960]   If you become, as a counselor,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.200]   just well-acquainted with these three attributes,
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.280]   the sovereignty of God, the wisdom of God, the love of God,
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.960]   you can apply that to,
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.360]   I mean, that's like a broad-spectrum antibiotic.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.480]   You can use that in so many different settings.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:25.520]   So many different people need to just understand
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.760]   God's sovereignty, wisdom, and love
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.140]   so that they can trust him.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.440]   And as they trust him,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:37.240]   then they will begin to bear good fruit in their lives.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.260]   So let me just encourage you
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.940]   to learn all of the attributes of God,
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.480]   but in counseling ministry,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.240]   don't drown your counselee
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.960]   in trying to get him or her to learn 20 attributes,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.160]   but become skilled in using one, two,
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.560]   or three attributes of God
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.400]   to really minister to your counselee.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.480]   So on your handout there,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.280]   we have the benefits of understanding the attributes of God.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.680]   First of all, the attributes of God
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.000]   help us to understand our lives.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.600]   That's going back to Packer's statement
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.120]   that the world becomes a strange,
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.720]   mad, and painful place
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.560]   for those who do not know about God.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.320]   But for those who do know God,
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.360]   the attributes of God helps us to understand our lives.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.780]   I don't know why our nation is going through the trials
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.160]   that we are going through.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.400]   I don't know why.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.100]   The full explanation of all that is happening today,
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.480]   I do know that God is sovereign,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.980]   that he is wise, that he is loving, that he is good.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.200]   And whatever his purpose is in this time,
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   it is ultimately the best possible purpose.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.180]   And if I understand those things, then I can trust him.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.200]   And I know I'm in the process of that.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.980]   I know many of you, you're in the process of doing that,
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.540]   of entrusting your lives to God during this time.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:22.540]   But the attributes of God help us to understand our lives.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.120]   Secondly, the attributes of God
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.780]   help us to respond rightly to trials.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:33.760]   I think of Joseph's statement in Genesis 50, verse 20,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.280]   when he was speaking to his brothers
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.700]   who had sold him into slavery.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.720]   And he says, "As for you, you meant evil against me,
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.920]   "but God meant it for good to bring it about
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.120]   "that many people should be kept alive as they are today."
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.240]   Although God is not the author of evil
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   and does not tempt any man to evil,
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.600]   Joseph's statement is that God is sovereign
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.200]   over even the evil deeds of man
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.820]   and uses even the sins of men
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.200]   to accomplish his good and holy purposes.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.140]   So he says to his brothers, "You meant this for evil.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.400]   "God meant this for good."
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.520]   And that enabled Joseph to respond graciously
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.200]   to his brothers.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.120]   So the truth of who God is will help us respond rightly
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.320]   to trials.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.720]   Thirdly, the attributes of God help us to endure
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.660]   through difficult seasons.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.160]   I think back to Jeremiah in the book of Lamentations.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.480]   Jeremiah couldn't have known all the details
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.080]   or the ins and outs of how God was going to use
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.020]   the Babylonian captivity for his glory.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:54.760]   He couldn't have known all of the details
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.200]   of how God was gonna do that.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.940]   We know from a New Testament perspective
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.760]   that God preserved the line of Judah
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.560]   and from Judah's line came the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.720]   And this was all part of God's plan
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.240]   to bring about salvation for the world.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.640]   But from Jeremiah's perspective,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.240]   he couldn't have known all that.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.560]   But he said, "I have hope
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.020]   "because although I don't know all that information,
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.780]   "I know who God is,
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:23.980]   "that he is loving, he is merciful, and he is faithful."
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:29.160]   And so the attributes of God help us endure
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.800]   through difficult seasons.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.360]   And then fourthly, the attributes of God
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.200]   equip us to minister to others.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.960]   Let me give you an example of this.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.580]   Let's say, for example, a counselee comes for counseling
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.580]   and says to me, "My child is rebellious.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.980]   "My child is hard-hearted.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:57.500]   "My child is involved with friends that I don't like.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.580]   "My child won't talk to me.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.660]   "What am I gonna say to this counselee?
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:07.660]   "How am I going to bring encouragement to this counselee?"
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.500]   Well, one option is to say,
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.640]   "Well, don't worry about it
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.500]   "'cause things are gonna get better."
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:21.040]   And that's the old Annie musical, right?
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.560]   "The sun will come up tomorrow.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.480]   "Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun."
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:32.480]   One option is to give my counselee this idea that,
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:36.880]   "I guarantee you that because you're a Christian,
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.000]   "things will get better."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.640]   Now, what have I just done there
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.760]   if I give my counselee that type of response?
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.160]   Well, possibly, I've given my counselee false hope
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.560]   because I don't know that.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.380]   I don't know if things are gonna get better,
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.920]   at least from a human temporal perspective.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.600]   I don't know if the situation is going to get better.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.200]   I don't know if God's plan for my counselee
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.880]   is that the trial is going to be removed.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.960]   Now, believe me, I'm gonna pray to that end.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.960]   I'm gonna pray that this child will turn in their heart
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   to the Lord and then the relationship will be restored.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.020]   But I don't know, I can't assume that God is gonna answer
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.740]   that prayer in the timing that I have designated
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.820]   or the timing that I would prefer.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.500]   If I say that to my counselee, "Don't worry about it.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.860]   "Things are gonna get better."
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:48.860]   Then I may be giving that person a false hope.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.320]   I may be guaranteeing things that I can't guarantee
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.720]   because I don't know what God's plan is for my counselee.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.320]   Let me give you a better option.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.780]   What if I say to my counselee, "Dear friend,
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.860]   "I don't know how the situation is going to work out
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.180]   "and I don't know what God's plan is for your life,
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.360]   "but I do know that God is faithful.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.920]   "I do know that God is loving.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.180]   "I do know that God is in complete control
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:33.800]   "of this situation and He will work this out
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.660]   "for His glory and for your good.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.920]   "And I just wanna encourage you to trust Him,
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.940]   "to trust Him with all your heart.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.700]   "Do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.020]   "Trust Him because He can be trusted.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:52.020]   "He is trustworthy and no one in the history of redemption
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:59.540]   "has ever trusted the Lord in vain.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.220]   "If you trust Him, you will not be an exception
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.640]   "to that rule.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.740]   "You can trust Him today because He is faithful.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.580]   "In fact, let's trust Him together.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.740]   "I'm gonna pray for you that God will help you
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.900]   "to trust Him, and I wanna trust the Lord
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.340]   "for you and for your child."
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.980]   And let's just see together if God will do a good work
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.080]   in this very difficult situation.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.020]   You see, what I have done at that point
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:36.500]   is I have rooted the counselee in the true hope
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:41.500]   of who God is, in His unchanging character,
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.720]   and not in a false hope that the circumstances of life
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.160]   will work in our favor,
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.540]   at least from a limited temporal perspective.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.620]   I don't know how the situation is going to work out.
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.600]   I do know that God will be faithful to my counselee
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.600]   if my counselee is a believer in Christ.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.180]   Now, watch this.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.540]   This isn't false advertising, but this does happen,
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.860]   and this has happened.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:18.400]   Let's say my counselee takes that counsel to heart
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.920]   and learns to trust God,
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:25.500]   and learns to say, "Whatever my situation may be,
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.000]   "whatever my child does or doesn't do,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.620]   "I know my God is faithful.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.360]   "I know my God is merciful.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.140]   "I know my God is sovereign.
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:39.140]   "I'm going to trust my God with my circumstances."
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.340]   And as my counselee learns to trust God,
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.620]   what you see in my counselee's heart
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.980]   is this beautiful fruit begins to grow,
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.040]   because that's what happens when you trust the Lord,
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   is there is joy, and there is peace, and there is patience,
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.140]   and there is wonderful fruit.
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:04.140]   There is hope that begins to grow in my counselee's heart,
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.800]   and just this gracious attitude.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:13.080]   And now my counselee is coming to his or her child
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:18.040]   with this heart that is filled with hope, grace,
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.860]   and mercy, peace, and patience.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.840]   Do you think that this parent
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.600]   will have a more effective ministry to that child
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.480]   now that the counselee's heart is trusting in the Lord?
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.420]   Do you think that this relationship might actually improve
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:46.160]   if the parent is walking with the Lord in this way?
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.540]   I don't know God's plan.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.960]   It's possibly that the child may still respond
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.120]   in a rebellious manner.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.960]   But from a human perspective,
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.400]   people who are filled with hope and joy
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.120]   are more likely to give encouragement to that child
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.800]   than those who are filled with anger
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.740]   and with anxiety.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.420]   There is more likely gonna be a good
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.840]   and beneficial ministry to that child
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.200]   because the counselee is rooted
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.400]   in a strong relationship with the Lord.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.320]   So that's the power of using the attributes of God
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.200]   in counseling ministry.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.520]   Now, I'm gonna be a lot quicker here,
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.280]   but let me just walk you through some material.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.360]   What is an attribute?
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.100]   An attribute of God is simply something
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.680]   that is true about God,
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.400]   and you can look at Wayne Grudem
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.440]   has some good information on that
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.240]   just defining what an attribute is.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   The attributes of God are typically
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:51.440]   categorized under incommunicable attributes
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.760]   and communicable attributes.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.200]   The communicable attributes are those attributes
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.440]   which are more reflected by man,
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.500]   at least to some substantial degree.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.720]   And the incommunicable attributes are those attributes
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.680]   which are less reflected by man,
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.880]   at least to any substantial degree.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.920]   And there's this intramural debate
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.520]   between theologians of which attributes
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.080]   fall under the category
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.640]   of being incommunicable versus communicable.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.880]   This is not an inspired table right here.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.000]   This is just one way that you might categorize these,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:30.920]   but generally speaking,
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.760]   theologians have categorized these attributes
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.640]   under the headings of communicable and incommunicable.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.960]   And the main idea here is that
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.480]   the communicable attributes are those
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.280]   that we as Christians are called to emulate or imitate.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.000]   We're called to be merciful because God is merciful.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.080]   We're called to be gracious
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.480]   because God is gracious and so forth and so on.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.200]   So the six attributes that this essay
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.040]   is asking you to write about are
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.960]   wrath, mercy, holiness, omnipotence,
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.240]   omniscience, and omnipresence.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.920]   I put a lot of material on your handout,
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.760]   but for our class time and we're limited in time,
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.880]   but I wanna give just a brief definition of the attributes,
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.300]   but really I'd like to give you some starter points
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.560]   of what would be the practical implications
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.120]   of this attribute for life and counseling.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.880]   I found that really what's the hardest part
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.600]   about writing this essay is not giving
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.820]   the correct definitions of the attributes,
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.960]   but really thinking through how would this attribute of God
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.680]   relate to life and counseling.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.120]   And I'm not gonna do all the work for you on this,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.640]   but I do wanna give you some starting points,
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.240]   just some things that might jog your mind
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.080]   and help you to start brainstorming
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.680]   of how these attributes might be used in counseling.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.280]   So first of all, we have the wrath of God,
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:08.680]   which is God's holy and righteous anger against sin.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.320]   Many passages speak of the wrath of God in scripture,
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.560]   Nahum chapter one, Luke chapter 13,
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:19.740]   and many passages on your handout there.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.960]   What would be some counseling implications
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.300]   for the wrath of God?
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.240]   Some thoughts to think through.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.900]   Number one would be, I think this attribute causes us
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.680]   to be very motivated to know if our counselee
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.020]   is a true believer or not.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:43.880]   If our counselee is not a true believer in Christ,
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.500]   then they have a much bigger problem
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.900]   than their counseling issue.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.920]   They have a much bigger problem than the fact
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:57.420]   that their marriage is under a lot of strain
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.740]   or that they have an anxiety issue.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.320]   If the counselee is not a true believer,
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.140]   then they are still under the wrath of God,
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:10.180]   and that is their main counseling issue.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:11.700]   Whatever the presenting problem is,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.900]   their main counseling issue is they need to be saved
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.540]   and believe and understand the gospel.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.740]   This is why you wanna take pains
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.620]   to get a good salvation testimony,
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:24.260]   to get a right understanding of the gospel
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.260]   with your counselee, because we should labor to know
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.760]   if our counselee is a true believer.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:35.000]   The truth of the wrath of God should produce humility
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.460]   in the heart of a counselee.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:43.680]   A husband says, "Well, I deserve to be respected by my wife
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.800]   "because I do all of these things for my family."
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.840]   Well, the truth is that you deserve the wrath of God
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.180]   because of your sins.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:58.120]   And anything less than eternal hell
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.980]   is God's undeserved favor in your life.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.300]   And if you come from that starting point,
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:07.860]   you come from a point of true humility.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.140]   Rehearsing this truth should produce humility
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.760]   in the life of the counselee.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.600]   This truth should also produce appreciation for Christ
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.860]   and his saving work.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.980]   The truth that Christ has drank the cup
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.780]   of God's wrath in full,
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.820]   and God's wrath has been satisfied
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.340]   for the believer in Christ.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.660]   Romans 8, verse one, "There is therefore no condemnation
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.320]   "for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.700]   Those are some starting points.
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.460]   You can think through implications on your own.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.620]   But again, we're trying to connect the attribute
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:47.580]   to how you would use this in life and in ministry.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:52.420]   "The mercy of God is his heart of compassion
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:55.260]   "for those who are in distress."
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.580]   Psalm 103, verse eight, "The Lord is merciful and gracious,
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:02.900]   "slow to anger and abounding and steadfast love."
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:09.140]   How would this attribute connect with life and ministry?
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:14.700]   Some ideas here, and this is just me getting you started
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.120]   on thinking through counseling implications.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.100]   I think the mercy of God should really shape
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.720]   the counselee's prayer life.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:26.820]   Especially, and you know this,
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.660]   especially when the counselee is in times of trial
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:31.940]   or difficulty.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:37.580]   Psalm 103, verse 13, "As a father shows compassion
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.860]   "to his children, so the Lord shows compassion
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:40.860]   "to those who fear him."
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.780]   We ought to encourage our counselees who are believers
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.660]   to come and cry out to God.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:52.460]   God is your heavenly father.
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.340]   If even evil fathers will not turn away their children
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.080]   when they're in times of distress,
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.620]   how much more will your heavenly father hear you
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.540]   when you come?
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:06.160]   Come to God, he is merciful, he is full of mercy.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.220]   And especially when you're in times of distress,
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:15.220]   call out to him because he will receive you
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:18.380]   if you're a believer in Christ.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.220]   You can use this attribute to help the counselee
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:24.020]   produce a heart of mercy for others
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:28.280]   in the life of, in their relationships.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.500]   One of the things we see often in counseling ministry
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.140]   is just counselees who have a hardened heart
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.140]   in their relationship with others.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:42.060]   And that heart needs to be melted by the mercy of God.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:50.060]   The counselee needs to be encouraged
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.580]   to have mercy upon others
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:55.520]   because God has had mercy upon him or her.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.340]   Let me just, before I move on here,
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:03.180]   let me just encourage you also that the quality
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:06.160]   of a good biblical counselor is mercy.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   I hope that you will pursue being a merciful
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.040]   biblical counselor,
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.960]   that you will just have compassion on people.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.440]   I've been just noticing over and over,
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.980]   biblical compassion is disarming.
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:29.640]   Just real compassion, just empathy,
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.240]   showing sympathy for another person who is in distress
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.240]   is disarming.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:41.720]   These individual expressions of compassion and mercy
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:46.060]   don't solve every issue, don't address every issue,
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:50.520]   but they do build relationships
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.600]   and bridges to relationships.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.200]   Moving quickly here, holiness of God
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.880]   is his complete separation from all creation
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.720]   and moral separation from sin.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.360]   It's the only attribute of God
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.280]   emphasized three times in scripture,
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.520]   Isaiah six, verse three.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:09.760]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.760]   "The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.120]   It's the one attribute that qualifies every other attribute
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.600]   so that when you look at the love of God,
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.820]   it is a holy love.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.320]   When you look at the wrath of God, it is a holy wrath.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.500]   When you look at the justice of God, it is a holy justice.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Some counseling implications for the holiness of God.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.520]   We need to be reminded that God uses holy vessels
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.580]   in his ministry.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:44.360]   Second Timothy two, verse 20 talks about those vessels,
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.400]   which are for honorable use.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.640]   Verse 21 says, "If anyone cleanses himself
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.400]   "from what is dishonorable,
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:55.120]   "he will be a vessel for honorable use set apart as holy."
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.840]   We need to be reminded to pursue holiness
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.660]   because God uses holy vessels.
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.980]   And also to be reminded that sanctification
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:11.840]   is ultimately beautiful because the idea of holiness
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.280]   is really connected with the idea of beauty.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:20.240]   God is beautiful because he is set apart from all sin
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.680]   and what is set apart perfectly
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.220]   from anything that is polluting.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.120]   We can expect to see God do beautiful things
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.720]   in the counseling ministry.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.940]   And then I'll just deal with the omnis,
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:42.480]   a little more quickly, the omnipotence of God,
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.440]   which is the truth that God is all powerful
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.580]   and able to do anything consistent with his own nature.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:52.120]   We have the omniscience of God,
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.880]   which means that God possesses all knowledge,
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.200]   and then the omnipresence of God,
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   which means that God is unlimited with respect to space.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.360]   What are the counseling implications
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:12.680]   of these great attributes?
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:16.040]   God's omnipotence means that nothing
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.000]   is too difficult for the Lord.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.320]   We should never lose hope for our counselees
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.200]   because whatever their issue is,
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.520]   nothing is too difficult for God.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.840]   God is infinite in power and he can do
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.340]   exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we ask or think.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:40.000]   I think reflecting on God's omniscience,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.440]   God's omniscience should lead us to be amazed at his love.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.080]   It's just amazing to know that God
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.040]   knows everything about us.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.600]   I love the song Chris Tomlin sings.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.360]   There's a line there that says,
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.840]   "You see the depths of my heart and you love me the same."
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:04.640]   Just an amazing truth that you can use
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.000]   to encourage your counselee.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.560]   God knows everything about you.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.040]   God knows everything about your past.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.500]   He knows everything about your present.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.440]   He knows everything about your future,
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.480]   and he loves you with an infinite love.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.280]   That's a powerful encouragement
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.000]   that you can give to your counselee.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:29.840]   Then God's omnipresence should fill us with solid comfort.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.520]   The truth that God has promised
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.520]   never to leave us or forsake us.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:40.280]   Jesus said, "Lo, I'm with you always to the end of the age."
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:44.360]   Those are some implications of those three attributes.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.760]   I'm sure you can think of some on your own as well.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.160]   Some final encouragements from the attributes of God.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.040]   Learn to use not only the principles,
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:04.320]   the definitions of God's attributes to give to your counselees,
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.360]   but also learn to use narratives
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.320]   to illustrate the truth of the attributes of God.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.400]   I mean, our pastor is teaching
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.600]   through the narrative of Ruth right now.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.880]   It's one thing to tell your counselee,
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.640]   "God is faithful, and he will be faithful to his people."
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:28.280]   It's another to walk through the narrative of Ruth together,
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:34.840]   and to show how God has been faithful to his people.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.360]   God was faithful to Naomi,
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.440]   God was faithful to Ruth,
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:44.360]   God was faithful through the actions of the kinsmen redeemer, Boaz.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:49.840]   To use that narrative to illustrate the attribute of God is a powerful thing.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.600]   The narratives of Joseph's life,
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.880]   the narrative of David's life.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.800]   I mean, so many narratives of scripture really highlight the attributes of God,
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.840]   and so become skilled in using narrative
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:09.760]   to teach the attributes of God to your counselee.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.480]   I have some counselors who are doing this right now,
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:23.680]   and I often say of them that if biblical counseling is learning to play piano,
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:32.440]   then sometimes I feel that some of my counselors are doing Mozart.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.600]   Because when I hear what they're doing in their counseling sessions,
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.480]   and in many ways,
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.960]   much more gifted than I am in this way,
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.600]   they're using narrative,
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.240]   they're using Old Testament,
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.880]   New Testament, they're using promises.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.240]   They're just weaving together a lot of different scriptures,
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.480]   a lot of different genres of scripture to
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.640]   communicate the truth of God's attributes to their counselees.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.720]   It's just a beautiful thing,
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.440]   and I just really am humbled by that,
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:07.400]   and also grateful for the counselors who
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.520]   use every part of scripture to teach their counselees the attributes of God.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.400]   So learn the narratives of scripture,
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.960]   and learn to illustrate these truths,
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.040]   and then learn to take your counselees to the cross.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:28.200]   It's really at the cross of Christ and his sacrificial death at Calvary,
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.160]   that the attributes of God are put on full display.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.200]   I mean, you can look at the cross,
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.000]   and you see the sovereignty of God,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.480]   of his redemptive plan being fulfilled.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.200]   You see the holiness of God,
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.240]   you see not only the holiness of the Father,
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.520]   his holy wrath against sin,
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:54.440]   you see the holiness of the sacrifice of the Son that was offered up at Calvary.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.280]   The holy wrath of God being perfectly fulfilled and
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.840]   satisfied because of the holiness of the sacrifice that
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.040]   was offered in the Son's redeeming work.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.640]   You see the wisdom of God that as 1 Corinthians 1 talks about,
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:21.160]   it's through the foolishness of the cross that the wisdom of God was put on display.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:26.120]   You see the mercy of God towards sinners that he would provide the sacrifice.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.160]   You see the love of God.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.080]   You see the justice of God and the holy law of God being perfectly fulfilled.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.320]   I mean, you just see all of the attributes of God put on
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.200]   full display in the cross of Christ and his redeeming work.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:48.040]   Learn to take the attributes of God and then go to the cross of Christ with these attributes.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.720]   Spurgeon talked about how he loved to take
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:57.120]   any truth that was in God's word and make a beeline to the cross with that truth.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.160]   Just theologically, if you think through it,
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.760]   any of the attributes of God will make a beeline to the cross.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:10.440]   You can be meditating on any attribute of God and you can go to
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.680]   the cross with that attribute because at the cross,
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.640]   the attributes of God are put on full display.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.920]   Just a final encouragement,
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.040]   it's not on the slide here,
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   but I just encourage you to devotionally take an attribute of God,
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.160]   one attribute a day maybe,
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:38.040]   and just dwell on that truth of who God is and praise God,
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.320]   adore God for his attribute,
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.160]   because that is one way to just enrich your own devotional life,
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.920]   and then also fill up your own heart with the truth of who God is,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.720]   and so that you're equipped to minister to others,
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.200]   reading through A.W. Tozer's The Knowledge of the Holy,
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.080]   and just taking one chapter a day,
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:01.160]   and just meditating on an attribute of God a day is one way to
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:06.240]   prime the pump for good solid biblical ministry.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.680]   Well, I have used up all my time tonight and then some.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.200]   I want to just commend to you the study of the attributes of God and pray that this was
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.400]   a good primer for the study that's ahead of you with essay number 8.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.880]   This is a great essay topic.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.920]   I trust that you'll have a wonderful time studying these attributes,
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   and then also writing this essay for God's glory.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.720]   May the Lord bless you.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.960]   I'm going to go ahead and close in prayer,
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.680]   and if you have any questions,
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.480]   I'll be happy to stick around for five minutes
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.120]   after and answer any questions you might have.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.520]   Otherwise, may the Lord bless your week,
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:54.040]   and have a great study this week,
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.480]   learning about the attributes of God. Let me pray for us.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.840]   Father, thank you for these truths.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:06.080]   We pray that the study would equip us to be effective biblical counselors.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:12.920]   Thank you for each of these beautiful attributes which express the truth of who you are.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.080]   We pray that we may learn them well,
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.600]   that our own hearts will be led to worship,
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.880]   and be filled with hope,
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.160]   and that we would be able to minister to those who are in need of help.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.560]   We give this study to you.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.800]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
