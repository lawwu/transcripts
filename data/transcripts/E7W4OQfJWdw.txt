[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.340]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.960]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.120]   Today, we are talking all about food and the brain.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.080]   We are going to talk about foods that are good
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.720]   for your brain in terms of focus,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.560]   in terms of brain health generally,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.500]   and the longevity of your brain,
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.600]   your ability to maintain cognition
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.000]   and clear thinking over time.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.280]   We are also going to talk about why
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.400]   and how you prefer certain foods to others.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.820]   And I'm going to talk about the three major signals
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.800]   that combine to drive your food choices.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.160]   I'll give you a little hint of what those are.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.580]   One of those signals comes from your gut
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.880]   and is completely subconscious.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.500]   This is not the gut microbiome per se.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.920]   These are neurons in your gut
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.440]   that are sending signals to your brain
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.660]   that you are unaware of about the nutrient contents
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.480]   of the foods that you're eating.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920]   The second signal is how metabolically accessible
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.780]   a given food is,
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.740]   meaning how readily that food can be converted
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.320]   into energy that your brain, not your body,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.880]   but that your brain can use.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.200]   And the third signal is perhaps the most interesting one.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.900]   It's the signal of belief.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.120]   It's the signal of what you perceive
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.800]   and believe the food that you're eating to contain
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.780]   and what you think it can do for you
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.920]   health-wise and energy-wise.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.180]   And that might sound a little wishy-washy or vague,
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.060]   but we're going to provide mechanistic data
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.840]   to support the fact that you can change what you eat,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.460]   so much so that you can drive your brain and your body
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.860]   to crave foods that are good for you,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.720]   or at least better for you
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.880]   than the foods you might currently be eating.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.560]   This is an incredibly powerful mechanism that we all have.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.180]   It's one that I think is very underappreciated.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.880]   And today I'm going to review the data
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.440]   from both animal models and fortunately more recently,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.960]   human studies that really do underscore the fact
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.360]   that you can control your desire for particular foods.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.560]   Before we dive into today's topic,
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.680]   I just want to briefly touch on some key takeaways
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.580]   from a previous episode,
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.520]   which is the episode on time-restricted feeding,
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.160]   also called intermittent fasting.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.440]   The key elements of time-restricted feeding
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.940]   that will benefit your health the most
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.560]   in terms of weight loss or maintenance, fat loss,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.160]   organ health, quality sleep, and cognition
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.240]   are that the feeding window begin
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.180]   at least one hour after waking.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.760]   You could push that feeding window out to begin later,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.440]   but at least one hour after waking,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.400]   and that it end at least two and ideally three hours
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.520]   before going to sleep.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.960]   Some people can end that feeding window
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.280]   much further away from the beginning of sleep,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.860]   meaning they're finishing their last bite of food,
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.080]   for instance, at 6 p.m.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.820]   and they're not going to sleep until midnight.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.640]   But many people struggle to get quality sleep
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.660]   if that feeding window is set too early
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.160]   relative to when they go to sleep.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.540]   So begin the feeding window at least one hour after waking,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.060]   end the feeding window at least two hours
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.140]   before going to sleep.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.200]   And a key feature based on the scientific research
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.760]   is that the feeding window itself fall more or less
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.100]   at the same period of each 24-hour day from day to day,
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.540]   meaning if you are going to eat over an eight-hour period,
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.240]   that's your feeding window,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.840]   you wouldn't want to start that feeding window
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.160]   at 10 a.m. one day and end it at 6 p.m.,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.040]   and then the next day start at noon and end it at 8 p.m.,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.420]   and the next day start it at 2 p.m.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.920]   and end it at 10 p.m. and so forth.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.740]   As much as is reasonably possible,
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.740]   if you want to extract the maximum benefit
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.360]   from time-restricted feeding,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.440]   the idea is to keep that feeding window
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.340]   at more or less the same phase, as it's called,
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.220]   of each 24-hour day.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.580]   If it slides around a little bit for social reasons
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.540]   or whatever reasons, it doesn't seem to be a big deal,
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.600]   but you don't want it sliding around
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.800]   by many hours from day to day
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   because of the way that that feeding window
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.040]   impacts other genes called clock genes
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.360]   that regulate a bunch of other processes in the body.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.240]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.760]   that this podcast is separate
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.240]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.360]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.640]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.840]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.320]   to the general public.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.760]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.780]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.960]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.140]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.920]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.480]   I've spent a career working on the visual system,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.280]   and one of the key problems that Roca sunglasses has solved
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.420]   is if you've ever worn sunglasses
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.200]   and you've gone from a very bright region
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.000]   to, say, a region with shadows,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.340]   oftentimes you have to take the sunglasses off.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.080]   They've designed their sunglasses in a way
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.860]   that no matter whether you're standing in the shade
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.060]   or in bright sunlight, you will always see things
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.160]   with absolute crystal clarity, which is wonderful.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.320]   Their eyeglasses as well are designed
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.100]   so that you can move from one region of brightness
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.520]   to another without noticing it at all.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.880]   The other thing that's really terrific
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.760]   about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.220]   is that they are very lightweight.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.360]   Most of the time, you don't even remember
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.700]   that they're on your face.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.320]   And you can wear them whether or not
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.500]   you're exercising or working
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.240]   because they won't slip off even if you get sweaty.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.840]   The other thing that's really wonderful
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.640]   is that the aesthetic is terrific.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.560]   Unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses out there
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.300]   that make people look like cyborgs,
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.480]   or frankly, just look rather strange,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.400]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.900]   You can wear them to dinner, to work, running, exercising,
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.140]   and they'll work for all those situations.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.240]   If you'd like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.780]   that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.540]   to save 20% on your first order.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.700]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.140]   that's designed to cover your foundational supplementation
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.500]   and health needs.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.920]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.560]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.320]   The reason I started using Athletic Greens
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.080]   and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.600]   once or twice per day
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.200]   is because it covers all of my vitamin mineral basic needs
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.320]   and because of the probiotics.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.280]   There's now ample data supporting the fact
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.080]   that probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.280]   and that the gut microbiome is important
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.600]   for keeping inflammation low, which is good,
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.560]   as well as for supporting the immune system
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.320]   and for supporting brain health
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.720]   through the so-called gut-brain axis.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.240]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.200]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.620]   and if you do that, you can claim a special offer.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.280]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.740]   so these packs make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.020]   when you're on the road, in the car, et cetera,
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.760]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.320]   There's now a lot of data pointing to the fact
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.180]   that vitamin D3 and K2 are important for hormonal health,
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.880]   for cardiovascular function,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.840]   and so if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.960]   you'll get the Athletic Greens,
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.020]   the five free travel packs,
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.180]   and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.480]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.080]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.740]   backed by 25 peer-reviewed published studies.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.040]   I think by now, most people have heard
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.000]   of the benefits of meditation,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   reduce stress, improve sleep, better cognition, et cetera.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I've been meditating for a long time,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.800]   but I have to admit it's been sort of an on and off thing.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.880]   There are periods of time over the last 10
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.920]   or gosh, even 20 or 30 years
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.540]   that I've meditated consistently,
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.200]   and then I'll stop meditating.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.940]   One of the terrific things about Headspace
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.160]   is that it has meditations
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.280]   of different duration and different type.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.020]   So I found that as soon as I started using Headspace,
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.960]   that I was meditating far more consistently.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.760]   One of the great things about meditation
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.100]   is that it works the first time and it works every time,
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.520]   and the more consistently I do it,
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.340]   the more positive benefits I seem to derive.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.560]   If you'd like to try Headspace,

[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.920]   I'd like to point you toward what I think
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.520]   is a very valuable zero cost resource online.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.560]   Recently, I took part in an event called Rethink Education
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.440]   that was put on by Logitech.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.800]   And there, I gave a 20 minute lecture
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.200]   where I describe the classic
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.080]   and modern neuroplasticity literature
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.120]   in both animal models and humans.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.960]   The neuroplasticity literature is, of course,
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.680]   the literature that describes how to rewire the brain
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.600]   in order to learn.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.880]   During that 20 minute talk, I described that literature,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.000]   but I also spell out what I call
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.160]   the neuroplasticity super protocol,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.280]   which is nine plus steps of things that teachers can apply
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.880]   in the classroom to teach any sort of information,
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.860]   music, math, sports, anything,
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.240]   and that students of any kind in any age
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.240]   can use to enhance the speed and depth of learning.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.640]   You can find that talk on YouTube
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.620]   by following the link in the caption to this episode,
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.120]   or by simply going to YouTube
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.160]   and entering the search terms Logitech Huberman.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.800]   Some of the most frequent questions I get
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.320]   are about food and the brain.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.640]   Everybody seems to want to know what they should eat
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.160]   and what they shouldn't eat
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.080]   in order to have peak brain function,
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.580]   to be able to focus and memorize things and so forth,
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.380]   and in order to maintain brain health over time,
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.600]   because nobody wants to lose their memory
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.160]   or have troubles with cognition.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.320]   Fortunately, there are a lot of data now
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.500]   from really good quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.800]   that indicate certain things that we can do,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.240]   including certain foods that we should eat
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.660]   and perhaps even some foods that we should avoid
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.360]   in order to enhance our brain function.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.720]   And of course, when I say brain,
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.700]   what I really mean is nervous system function,
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.160]   because how we are able to move and remember things,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.480]   et cetera, doesn't just depend on the neurons,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.780]   the nerve cells that are in our head,
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.000]   it also depends on our spinal cord
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.860]   and the neurons that connect to all the organs of our body.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.360]   So in general, there are two categories of things
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.680]   that are going to improve brain health
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.000]   from the perspective of nutrition.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.260]   The first category is the general category
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.080]   of things that we eat and avoid
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.360]   and things that we do and avoid doing
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.180]   that will modulate brain health and function.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.600]   What do I mean by modulate?
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.320]   Well, getting quality sleep on a regular basis,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.560]   making sure that you're socially connected,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.680]   making sure that you're not depressed.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.560]   All these things are vitally important to our overall health
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.720]   and of course they will impact brain function,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.440]   but they do it more or less indirectly, okay?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.000]   There are a few things that happen in sleep
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.100]   which directly benefit brain function and repair, et cetera.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.840]   But today I really want to concentrate
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   not on the things that modulate our overall health,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.640]   but rather the things that mediate brain health directly
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.680]   and in particular, how certain foods enhance brain function.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.320]   And we are going to talk about
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.720]   how we can change our relationship to food,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.780]   literally how we can start to prefer certain foods
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.340]   that are better for us than others.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.080]   So just briefly, I want to touch on the modulatory components
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.040]   because they are vital.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.000]   First of all, getting quality sleep on a regular basis
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.440]   and ample sleep on a regular basis
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.720]   is the foundation of all mental health and physical health.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.320]   There's no question about that.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.040]   We have done several episodes,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.320]   including the Master Your Sleep episode,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.720]   which is episode two of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.620]   And we've done a lot of other episodes
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.780]   that are all about sleep and how to get better at sleeping.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.440]   So I just want to make crystal clear
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.480]   that unless you're sleeping well on a regular basis,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.560]   your brain will suffer.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.740]   You won't be able to focus very well, learn very well.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.520]   And indeed there are data linking poor quality sleep
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.820]   to dementia or at least exacerbating preexisting dementias
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.660]   and things of that sort.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.280]   So get your sleep in order.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.880]   The other of course is cardiovascular health and exercise.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.840]   The general prescription that's out there in the literature
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.400]   and I think is well-supported
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.080]   is to get somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.200]   of cardiovascular exercise per week.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.540]   If you choose to also use resistance exercise, that's great,
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.720]   but the 150 to 180 minutes minimum per week
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.800]   of cardiovascular exercise is crucial for heart health
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.440]   and heart health directly relates to brain health
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.640]   because the brain consumes a lot of oxygen, glucose,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.520]   and other factors that are delivered via the blood.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.560]   So if your arteries are clogged up
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.380]   and you've got poor vascular supply to the brain
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.260]   in any region of the brain, your brain will suffer.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.400]   So get cardiovascular health in order.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.620]   Now with those two modulatory elements set forth
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.060]   so that we're all aware that they're there
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.480]   and they are vitally important.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.160]   Now I'd like to turn to the elements that have been shown
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.960]   to be vitally important for directly controlling,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.260]   for mediating neuron function.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.600]   Neurons of course are nerve cells in the brain
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.960]   and there are other cell types too of course
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.980]   that will impact brain function.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.340]   The most prominent of which are the so-called glia.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.760]   Glia means glue, but even though for a long time
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.680]   people thought that these cells
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.560]   were just kind of holding things together passively,
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.920]   the glia play a very active role in the metabolism neurons,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.100]   in brain function, and probably also in cognition,
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.360]   in thinking and so forth.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.000]   So what are the things that directly impact brain health
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.840]   and what are the foods that we can eat
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.680]   that will support brain health?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   Generally, when we think about neuron function
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.940]   and brain function, we default to a discussion about fuel.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.520]   The fact that neurons use glucose, which is blood sugar
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.720]   and that they require a lot of it.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.560]   In some cases, they'll use ketones,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.200]   which we will talk about a little bit later,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.440]   especially in people that are following a low carbohydrate
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   or ketogenic diet.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.880]   But before we can even consider the fuels that neurons use
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.400]   in order to function, we have to talk about the elements
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.640]   that actually allow those neurons to be there
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.760]   and to stay healthy, what actually makes up those neurons.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.680]   And that brings us to what I would argue
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.380]   is the most important food element for brain function.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.180]   And that is fat.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.840]   And that might come as a surprise,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.100]   but unless one considers the water content of the brain,
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.540]   which is very high, a lot of our brain
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.780]   and a lot of the integrity of the nerve cells,
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.840]   the so-called neurons in our brain
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.920]   and the other types of cells comes from fat.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.820]   And that's because nerve cells and other cells in the brain
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.800]   have a external layer.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.560]   It's what's sometimes called a double layered membrane.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.280]   It's essentially two thin layers
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.160]   that serve as a boundary between those cells.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.680]   And that boundary is very important
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.220]   because how things pass across that boundary
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.560]   actually regulates the electrical activity of neurons,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.880]   which is the way that neurons fire and communicate
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.120]   and keep you thinking and acting
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.040]   and doing all the good things
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.240]   that those neurons allow us to do.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.800]   And those membranes are made up of fats,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.040]   but they're not made up of the fats
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.240]   that are around our belly,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.960]   around the other organs of our body.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.600]   They're not made up of storage fat.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.360]   They are made up of structural fat
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   and maintaining the so-called integrity
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.840]   of that structural fat,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.960]   meaning the health of those neurons
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.800]   is going to come in large part from the foods that we eat.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.960]   Now, this needs to be underscored.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.040]   What I'm saying is that the foods that we eat
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.040]   actually provide the structural basis,
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.120]   the building blocks of the very neurons
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.640]   that allow us to think over time.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.440]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.880]   the fat that makes up those neurons and other nerve cells
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.160]   is different than the other types of fat in the body.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.720]   So what type of fat is it and what should we eat
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.520]   in order to support that fat and those neurons?
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.280]   And the answer is the so-called essential fatty acids
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.780]   and phospholipids.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.400]   Now, those are more or less the same thing,
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.840]   but I just want to make a very large literature
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.000]   very crystal clear.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.800]   Essential fatty acids can include the so-called EPA variety
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.400]   or DHA variety.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.060]   You hear about omega-3s and omega-6s.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.460]   Most people are getting enough omega-6s from their diet,
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.300]   not everybody,
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.240]   but most people are getting enough omega-6s.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.220]   However, most people are not getting enough omega-3s
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.340]   in their diet to support healthy brain function
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.000]   in the short and long term.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.740]   I've talked before about the benefits
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.220]   of elevating the levels of omega-3s in one's diet
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.840]   for sake of offsetting depression and for enhancing mood.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.360]   And indeed there's a wealth of literature now
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.960]   pointing to the fact that ingesting at least one or two
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.120]   or even three grams per day of EPA form
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.220]   of essential fatty acid can have effects,
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.180]   positive effects on mood and wellbeing
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.280]   that are at least on par
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.560]   with some of the major antidepressant treatments out there,
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.620]   but without similar side effects
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.160]   to those antidepressant treatments.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.880]   And that for people that are already taking antidepressants,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.400]   that supplementing with one to two to three grams of EPA,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.880]   essential fatty acids can actually allow a lower dose
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.000]   of antidepressant treatment to be used
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.340]   and still be effective.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.940]   So that's depression,
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.820]   but just in terms of maintaining normal cognitive function
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.040]   in people that aren't depressed,
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.240]   the EPAs and omega-3s seem to play a very important role.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.200]   Of course, you can supplement EPAs through various fish oils
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.260]   and it could be liquid fish oil or capsule fish oil.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.060]   Some people, if they're not interested in eating fish
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.920]   for whatever reason, they're allergic or for ethical reasons,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.200]   they can take krill oil.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.760]   And if they don't want to use krill oil,
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.680]   they can use algae and other forms of EPA.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.440]   However, I think it's clear that one can get a lot of EPA
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.840]   from the proper foods.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.780]   And it turns out that those foods, not surprisingly,
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.320]   don't just contain high levels of EPA,
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.120]   but they also contain other things
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.980]   that are beneficial for brain health.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.880]   So what are foods that are high in omega-3s
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.000]   that we should all probably be consuming,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.760]   at least on a daily basis?
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.360]   The number one is fish.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.100]   So things like mackerel and salmon and herring and oysters
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.320]   and sardines and anchovies.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   And perhaps the heavyweight champion
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.240]   of EPAs per unit volume is caviar.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.640]   Now, I don't know about you,
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.420]   but I'm not eating a lot of fish.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.040]   I'm not eating a lot of caviar.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.100]   I can't remember the last time I had a caviar,
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.560]   unless it was sprinkled on a little bit of sushi.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.520]   I'm not a big fish eater, personally.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.900]   I will from time to time,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.200]   but that's one reason why one might want to supplement
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.640]   with EPAs from another source.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.600]   But also, EPAs are found in chia seeds, in walnuts,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.980]   in soybeans and other plant-based foods.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.920]   You can look these up online and you'll immediately see
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.540]   that there are a lot of sources of EPAs.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.760]   And many of the foods that I listed off
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.040]   might be appetizing to you.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.760]   Some of them might be unappetizing to you,
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.200]   or some of them you might be sort of neutral about.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.360]   But it's very clear that eating foods
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.520]   that are rich in omega-3s and/or supplementing
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.880]   with omega-3s to get above that 1.5 grams
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.100]   and ideally up to two or even three grams per day of EPA
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.240]   can be very beneficial for cognitive function
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.520]   in the short and long term.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.520]   Later in the episode, I'm going to talk about
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.000]   how to actually change your relationship
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.560]   to particular foods so that foods
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.720]   that you don't particularly like,
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.840]   you can actually start to like more.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.560]   And that might be important for those of you
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.600]   that are thinking mackerel, sardines.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.740]   I mean, I'm making this face because frankly,
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.300]   those are not foods that I naturally like.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.740]   But again, I want to emphasize
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.500]   that you don't have to consume fish and animal products
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.880]   in order to get sufficient EPAs.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.140]   You can get them from plants,
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.240]   but I do believe based on the quality peer-reviewed research
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.000]   that everybody should be striving
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.800]   to get a minimum threshold of at least a gram and a half
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.360]   of EPAs per day, one way or the other.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.880]   The great thing about omega-3s
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.920]   is that they are also thought to be beneficial
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.680]   for things like cardiovascular health.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.000]   And although there's some controversy there
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.540]   as to whether or not two grams or three grams or six grams
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.960]   is ideal for cardiovascular health,
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.280]   I think the bulk of evidence points to the fact
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.220]   that getting sufficient omega-3s in the diet
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.780]   is going to support cardiovascular health.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.540]   Certainly not the only thing people should be doing
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.500]   to support their cardiovascular health,
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.640]   aerobic exercise and so forth being important also,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   but it does seem to support cardiovascular health
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.120]   and in doing so, supporting brain health.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   However, what I'm emphasizing is ingestion of omega-3s
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.760]   to support the very cells within the brain
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.000]   that make up our cognition,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.660]   that allow for cognition and for movement and memory
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.000]   and all the other marvelous things that the brain does.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.680]   The other compound that has been shown
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.500]   to be directly supportive of neuronal function
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.460]   is phosphatidylserine,
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.900]   which is abundant in meats and in fish.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.800]   So here we are again, back to fish being an important source
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.200]   of brain supporting food.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   Phosphatidylserine is something that nowadays
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.320]   people are supplementing, it's a lipid-like compound
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.880]   that at least in three studies have been shown
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.280]   to improve cognition, these weren't huge effects,
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.700]   but they were statistically significant effects
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.380]   and as well in more than three, at least five studies
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.880]   to reduce cognitive decline.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.620]   And this is interesting, in every case,
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.500]   it was 300 milligrams supplemented phosphatidylserine,
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.120]   but one again, doesn't need to supplement phosphatidylserine.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.700]   Phosphatidylserine can be derived as I mentioned
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.740]   from meats and fish and to some extent
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.280]   from cabbage of all things.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.440]   I don't know how much cabbage people are ingesting,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.060]   but later when we talk about gut health
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.400]   and the relationship between gut health and brain health,
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.600]   I'll mention fermented foods and of course,
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.120]   one of the most readily available fermented foods out there
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.720]   that at least many people find appetizing is sauerkraut,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.440]   which is of course made from cabbage, it's fermented cabbage.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.680]   So for those of you that do consume meat and fish,
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.880]   provided you're getting enough fish,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.860]   you're probably getting enough phosphatidylserine.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.000]   For those of you that are interested
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   in supplementing phosphatidylserine
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.900]   to get these effects that were reported
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.560]   in these various manuscripts,
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.040]   which by the way, I've read and looked solid.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.800]   I mean, I don't think we've seen the landmark studies
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.000]   showing that supplementing with phosphatidylserine
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.240]   at 300 milligrams per day is going to create
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.220]   a huge offsetting of a massive cognitive decline
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.480]   or a massive increase in brain function.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.600]   These seem to be modest effects,
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.640]   but the effects do appear to be real.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.040]   And for those of you that are interested
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.880]   in supplementing with phosphatidylserine,
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.920]   it's a relatively inexpensive supplement
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.660]   that again is lipid-like.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.360]   So it's mimicking some of the same things
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.560]   that you would get from food, but in higher concentration.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   Now, after EPA, fatty acids and phosphatidylserine,
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.680]   I would say third on the list of things that come from food
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.360]   that can readily support brain function would be choline.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.640]   And that's because of the relationship to choline
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.120]   in the biosynthesis pathway for acetylcholine.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.400]   Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator, not a neurotransmitter,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.680]   but a neuromodulator in the brain.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.200]   A neuromodulator is a chemical that modulates
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.480]   the function of many brain circuits
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.680]   and also circuits within the body.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.400]   I'll mention what those are in a moment,
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.640]   but acetylcholine as a neuromodulator
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.000]   tends to enhance the activity, the electrical activity
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.700]   and chemical activity of certain sets of neurons
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.720]   and downplay the activity of other neurons.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.680]   So it's sort of a conductor of sorts
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.540]   leading to enhanced function and activity
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.340]   in certain brain areas and circuits and others.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.960]   For instance, the brain areas that are involved
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.540]   in focus and alertness.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.940]   We have multiple clusters of neurons in our brain
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.840]   that make acetylcholine.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.620]   Two of the most prominent and well-known
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.020]   are the so-called nucleus basalis,
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.100]   which is a cluster of neurons deep in the basal forebrain
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.860]   that highlight particular areas of our brain,
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.660]   highlight meaning when acetylcholine is released
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.840]   from those neurons at their nerve endings
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.960]   in particular areas of the brain,
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.680]   those particular areas of the brain
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.720]   can undergo enhanced levels of activity
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.260]   relative to surrounding area.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.120]   So it's kind of a electrical highlighter pen, if you will,
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.040]   by analogy.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:05.360]   That is the basis of much of what we call focus
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.640]   or our ability to concentrate on a particular batch
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.440]   of information that's coming in through our eyes,
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.280]   our ears, our nose,
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.520]   or even things that we're just thinking in our head.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.600]   So having ample choline for production of acetylcholine
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.680]   allows for focus through, of course,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.200]   many intervening steps.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.960]   There are also regions of the brain
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.080]   in the so-called back of the brain,
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.040]   the hindbrain that release acetylcholine
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.200]   that are involved in general states of alertness.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.460]   And not surprisingly then,
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.940]   many of the treatments for Alzheimer's disease,
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.480]   which is an inability or challenges
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.180]   with remembering things and focusing
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.160]   are drugs that impact the acetylcholine pathway
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.540]   and are aimed at enhancing the amount of acetylcholine
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.500]   that's available to neurons.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.740]   And it can do that through a number of different mechanisms.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.820]   You can do that by enhancing the amount of acetylcholine
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820]   that's created,
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.580]   or you can do that by taking a drug
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.860]   that can reduce the amount of enzyme
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.220]   that gobbles up the acetylcholine
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.280]   and in doing so leading to more net acetylcholine.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.340]   But outside of the scenario
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.360]   where somebody has cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's,
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.000]   all of us are able to focus to some degree or not,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.780]   or are able to be alert to some degree or not
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.960]   based on the amount of acetylcholine that we have.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.040]   Now, other processes of course are involved,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.640]   but what this means is that making sure
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.920]   that we have enough of the substrates
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   to create acetylcholine is vital
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.460]   if we want to be able to focus.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.720]   And that's why dietary choline is so vital.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.160]   And the primary source for dietary choline
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.960]   would be eggs and in particular egg yolks.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.700]   And this again has a very interesting relationship
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.080]   to our evolution as well.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.560]   We're always referred to as hunter gatherers,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.920]   but when one hears hunters,
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.520]   we often think about meat and animal sources.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.080]   And indeed as a species,
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.260]   we hunted many, many other species of animals
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.220]   to consume them and still do.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.760]   But we also fished, we talked about that earlier
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.040]   and consumed a lot of fish and we consumed a lot of eggs.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.800]   Eggs are an incredibly rich source
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.820]   of nutrients for the brain.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.480]   And that's because the egg actually, if you think about it,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.680]   contains all the nutrients that are required
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.620]   in order for an organism to grow.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.960]   A bird that's in a egg shell, it's got the yolk there
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.940]   and it's using that yolk for a reason.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.720]   It's using that yolk as a source of fuel.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.800]   It's using that yolk as a source of literally building blocks
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.400]   in order to create its nervous system.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.500]   Many years ago, I worked on chick embryos
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.920]   and as these amazing experiments,
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.880]   you could actually take an egg
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.380]   and you could create a little window in the top
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.700]   and these were fertilized eggs.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.900]   And you'd see over time, you could peer in there,
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.380]   literally look in with a microscope
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.560]   or even with the naked eye.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.840]   And you would see this little chick embryo
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.660]   sitting on top of that yolk growing and growing
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.500]   and growing and growing
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.260]   and the yolk getting smaller and smaller.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.040]   It's really incredible.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.420]   They're using that as a source
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.260]   for all the building blocks of the body,
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.480]   but in particular, the nervous system.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.420]   So eggs are a rich source of choline.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.760]   Some people will supplement with choline.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.800]   However, food sources seem to be the best source of choline.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.420]   And as with the EPAs and the omega-3s,
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.400]   there are plenty of foods that are non-animal based
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.340]   that contain choline.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.520]   So if you're somebody who doesn't eat eggs
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.780]   or doesn't want to eat eggs,
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.940]   things like potatoes, nuts and seeds and grains and fruit,
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.900]   they don't have as much choline as eggs,
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.460]   but they do contain choline.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.260]   So you can look up the values of choline
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.260]   that are present in those various foods
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.340]   and make sure that you're reaching
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.420]   the threshold amount of choline for you.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.580]   In general, most people should probably strive
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.680]   to get somewhere between 500 milligrams
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.920]   and a gram of choline per day, so 1,000 milligrams.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.240]   And some people rely on supplementation
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.840]   in order to hit those levels
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.540]   because they're not eating a lot of egg yolks
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.820]   or they're not eating a lot of other foods.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.480]   Certain fish contain choline, for instance,
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.900]   and the other foods I listed off a few minutes ago
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.960]   from plant-based sources.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.700]   So some people will supplement with 50 to 100 milligrams
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.200]   or whatever amount is necessary
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.800]   to get them up to that one gram
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.680]   or even a two gram dose per day.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.020]   So we have three things
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.700]   that we know can support nerve cells.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.240]   EPA, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   phosphatidylserine and choline.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.880]   Those three things I would list off
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.680]   as the top three things for enhancing neuron function
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.280]   and the integrity of neurons in the short and long term.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.560]   And this is, again, is setting aside
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.040]   the vitally important factors
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   of hydration and electrolytes.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.480]   I've said it before on other podcasts,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.800]   but if you're not ingesting enough water
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.200]   and you're not getting enough sodium
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.160]   and magnesium and potassium,
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.080]   then obviously your neurons can't run
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.600]   because a lot of the brain is water.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.200]   You need to maintain proper hydration
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.000]   and sodium, potassium, and magnesium are important
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.320]   in order for nerve cells to function.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.520]   In fact, they are actually the components,
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.800]   the ions that pass across those lipid membranes,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.920]   those little fatty membranes
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.040]   that we were talking about earlier
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.960]   that allow the neurons to generate electrical activity
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.520]   and communicate with one another.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.840]   So definitely you want to hydrate enough.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.360]   We will do an entire other episode
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.060]   all about hydration and electrolytes,
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.060]   but omega-3s, the EPAs, phosphatidylserine and choline,
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:17.080]   it's obvious, are going to improve brain function.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.600]   How much they will improve brain function
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.520]   probably depends on how well
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.860]   your brain was working previously.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.880]   In fact, many of the studies that have looked
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.460]   at the effectiveness of these compounds
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.440]   have looked in people that are suffering from mild
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.680]   or even severe cognitive decline.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.920]   And while the outcomes of those studies vary,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.080]   given the interest in maintaining brain function,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.200]   given the fact that we don't make new neurons
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.760]   throughout our entire life,
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.280]   and given that everybody has to eat,
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.080]   these are quality, healthy foods
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.800]   that we should all be ingesting anyways,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.460]   and it's clear that they can support brain function
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.880]   to some degree or another.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.080]   Many people ask what I do in light of this information.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.160]   And while I can only talk about what works for me,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.080]   I choose to ingest fish oil in mainly in liquid form,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.580]   because that turns out to be the easiest way
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.760]   and the most economically affordable way to do it
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.280]   for most people.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.760]   So there are various forms of liquid fish oil out there.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.360]   Some of them include some lemon flavoring,
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.680]   so it doesn't taste like fish oil,
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.000]   because frankly, fish oil to me is sort of noxious tasting.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.920]   And I'll take a tablespoon of that or two per day.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.780]   If I'm traveling, I'll use the capsule form
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.160]   in order to hit that threshold of, for me,
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.520]   about two, sometimes even three grams per day of EPA.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.400]   So not just two or three grams per day of fish oil,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.640]   but two or three grams per day of EPA.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.080]   Now, if I'm eating fish,
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.000]   which as I mentioned earlier is not often,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.040]   then I might reduce the amount of fish oil that I take,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.280]   but that's my major source of fish oil.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.460]   Currently, I do not supplement with phosphatidylserine.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.240]   A number of people that I know and trust,
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.440]   and indeed several colleagues of mine
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.120]   do take phosphatidylserine.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.400]   I don't have any good explanation
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.220]   for why I don't take it yet,
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.480]   but I have not tried supplementing with it yet.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.600]   Maybe if some of you have,
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.460]   you can place your experience in the comment section.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.600]   That would be of interest.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   And then in terms of choline,
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   in order to get choline in my diet,
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.060]   I do pay attention to the various foods that contain choline
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.820]   and I try and get those foods on a semi-regular basis.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.480]   I do supplement with something called alpha-GPC,
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.960]   which is essentially in the acetylcholine pathway
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.800]   or biosynthesis pathway.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.240]   I don't take it very often,
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.520]   but I will take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.360]   from time to time.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.200]   From time to time,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.280]   I mean anywhere from two to three times per week.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.680]   I'll generally do it early in the day
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.160]   'cause it, for me, can have a little bit
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.560]   of a stimulant effect,
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.040]   although it's not nearly as stimulating, say,
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.600]   as a double espresso or triple espresso.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.040]   But that's one way in which I enhance my choline function.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.440]   And some people choose to get it from supplementation
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.120]   because it's straightforward.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.280]   There are a lot of supplements out there
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.820]   that contain alpha-GPC.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.240]   Some people are taking dosages
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.920]   as high as 900 milligrams per day.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.240]   That sounds very high to me.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.160]   The studies of offsetting cognitive decline
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.100]   using alpha-GPC did use quite high dosages
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.820]   of 600 to 900 or even 1200 milligrams per day.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.880]   So it has been used at those much higher concentrations,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.300]   but because fortunately, at least not yet
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.200]   or not to my awareness,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.440]   I'm not suffering from any cognitive decline,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.760]   I will supplement with 300 milligrams every now and again.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.160]   Next on my list of compounds that have been shown
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.900]   in peer-reviewed research to improve neuronal
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.480]   and brain function is creatine.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.840]   Creatine can be derived from meat sources.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.500]   It can also be supplemented.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.000]   Some of you are probably familiar with creatine
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.540]   or have heard about creatine from the context
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.840]   of the health and fitness world,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.200]   where creatine is used to bring more water into muscles,
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.540]   which can enhance the strength of those muscles,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.540]   as well as bring water into other tissues.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.400]   So it doesn't just draw more water into muscle,
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.080]   it can draw more water into the body generally.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   Creatine has also been shown to have an important role
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.280]   in brain function.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.040]   And once again, this is something that came up
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.220]   during the discussion about depression a few episodes back.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.720]   Creatine can actually be used as a fuel source in the brain.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.100]   And there's some evidence that it can enhance the function
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.540]   of certain frontal cortical circuits that feed down onto
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.900]   or rather connect to areas of the brain
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.160]   that are involved in mood regulation and motivation.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.320]   And that's where creatine plays a role in depression,
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.060]   or rather where creatine supplementation seems to be able
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.160]   to assist in some forms of mild depression.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.360]   That's an emerging literature.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.280]   It's still not well-established.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.320]   However, there is now ample evidence
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   that creatine supplementation can enhance brain function
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.720]   in certain contexts.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.000]   And if you're interested in learning more
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.540]   about what those contexts are,
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.560]   there's an excellent review that just came out.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.440]   The first author is Rochelle, R-O-S-C-H-E-L.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.620]   We will provide a link to this study,
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.200]   rather this review, excuse me, in the caption.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.860]   This was published just very recently in 2021.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.400]   And one thing to make clear is that creatine supplementation
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.940]   has been shown to be especially useful
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.440]   for people that are not consuming any meat
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.400]   or other sources of foods that are rich in creatine.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.940]   What is the threshold level of creatine to supplement
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.000]   in order to get the cognitive benefit?
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.120]   Appears to be at least five grams per day.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.560]   Now, the most typical form of creatine
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.240]   is so-called creatine monohydrate.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.320]   There are other forms of creatine as well,
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.460]   some of which are thought to not draw as much water
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.480]   into non-muscle tissues.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.880]   And for some people that that's attractive to them,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.560]   they don't want water sitting below their skin, et cetera.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.760]   I should emphasize that the responses to creatine
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.660]   in that sense can differ.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.680]   Some people get a little bit of water retention.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.520]   Some people experience more.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.880]   There's some evidence that creatine can impact
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.060]   some of the hormonal pathways
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.240]   that it might enhance levels
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.880]   of so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.500]   And therefore, because DHT is involved in hair loss,
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.540]   there are these theories that creatine can cause hair loss.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.000]   And indeed, for people that are very DHT sensitive,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.960]   it might.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.680]   There's going to be a lot of variation person to person
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.220]   in terms of how much creatine impacts DHT
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.600]   and how many DHT receptors they have on their scalp
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.580]   and therefore whether or not they experience hair loss.
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.060]   I'm just giving you all this information
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.040]   so that you're aware of the various things
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.500]   that creatine can do.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.440]   But nonetheless, I think it's interesting
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.120]   that creatine supplementation of five grams per day,
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.640]   that's creatine monohydrate,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.220]   has been shown to improve cognition
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.200]   in people that aren't getting creatine from animal sources.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.840]   And there's some evidence detailed within the review
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.520]   that I just described
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.960]   that creatine supplementation can also enhance cognition
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.000]   in people that are also eating animal products.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.880]   So I personally take creatine five grams per day
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.560]   and have for a very long time.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.480]   I can't say that I've noticed a tremendous benefit
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.880]   because I've actually never really come off it.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.640]   And so I've never done the control experiment.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.480]   I take it more as kind of a baseline insurance policy.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.140]   For me, I'm probably losing,
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.520]   I'm certainly losing some of my hair,
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.180]   whether or not that's due to creatine or not.
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.160]   I've never done the analysis.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.820]   But what I can say is that I generally consume these things
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.260]   like EPAs, creatine, alpha GPC,
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.260]   to set a general context of support for my neurons,
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.300]   for my brain.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.500]   And of course, I also pay attention to the foods
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.240]   that contain these various compounds.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.660]   So I don't actively eat additional meat
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.960]   just to obtain creatine.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.540]   I eat a fairly limited amount of meat.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.960]   I don't restrict it, and I do eat meat,
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.380]   but I don't actively seek out creatine in my diet.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.640]   Rather, I use supplementation
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.360]   in order to hit that five grams per day threshold.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.340]   Next on the list of foods
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.820]   that are beneficial for brain health
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.420]   is one that you've probably seen pictures of online
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.080]   because there seems to be a practice
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.760]   of putting pictures of blueberries and other dark berries
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.260]   next to any title that says foods that benefit your brain.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.040]   There are a lot of foods out there
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.940]   that have been purported to improve brain function.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.240]   The interesting thing about blueberries and other berries,
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.620]   blackberries, dark currants,
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.060]   any of these thin-skinned berries
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.580]   that are purplish in color
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.820]   is that they contain what are called anthocyanins.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.580]   Anthocyanins actually have some really nice data
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.020]   to support the fact that they improve brain function.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.980]   Now, whether or not it is direct effects on neurons
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.720]   or whether or not it is by lowering inflammation
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.960]   or some other modulatory effect isn't quite clear,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.060]   but I think by now there's enough data
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.140]   to support the fact that eating a cup or two of blueberries
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.420]   pretty often every day,
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.920]   or maybe you have blackberries or maybe it's blackcurrants,
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.720]   that these anthocyanins are good for us,
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.860]   that they are enhancing our overall wellbeing
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.940]   at a number of different levels.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.500]   And just to give you a couple of examples
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.840]   of where there are actually peer-reviewed studies
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.900]   to support those statements,
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.180]   the anthocyanins of which blueberries
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.300]   and other dark berries are rich in
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.420]   have been shown to reduce the amount of DNA damage,
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.140]   has been shown to reduce significantly,
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.660]   albeit slightly, excuse me, cognitive decline.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.980]   And that particular study was supplementation
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.380]   of a blueberry extract.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.980]   I'll talk about the difference between extract
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.340]   and actual blueberries in a moment,
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.320]   but supplementation of blueberry extract
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.180]   in offsetting cognitive decline in elderly people.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.100]   So, you know, what constitutes elderly
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.500]   is always a little bit of a debate and a discussion,
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.600]   but in this case, what they did is they supplemented
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.500]   with somewhere between 428,
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.080]   I don't know why they selected 428,
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.540]   and 598 milligrams of anthocyanins daily for 12 weeks
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.820]   was associated with improvements
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.320]   on verbal learning and memory.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.800]   And they had some other beneficial changes
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.540]   that were within the bodily organs
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:57.180]   and blood glucose regulation and so forth, positive changes.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.920]   But that's one study.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.080]   In this case, elderly meant 65 or older.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.840]   That study and a number of studies like it,
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.540]   looking at things like mildly enhanced memory,
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.360]   reduced insulin levels, reduced oxidation of LDL,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.920]   these sorts of things, have basically created a situation
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   where anytime you Google or look up foods
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.260]   that enhance brain function,
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.000]   you're going to see a picture of a blueberry
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.020]   or some other berry because of these anthocyanins.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.160]   I personally don't supplement anthocyanins.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.200]   I do like blueberries.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.700]   I eat blueberries when they're in season.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.540]   I love them.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.480]   I'm what you would call a drive-by blueberry eater.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.460]   Like if there are blueberries in a bowl on a table
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.700]   and I'm walking by, I just have to scoop them up
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.760]   like some sort of bear or other animal
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.720]   and pop them in my mouth.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.160]   So blueberries don't last long around me.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.540]   One of the issues with berries,
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.240]   like blueberries and blackberries and so forth,
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.880]   is that quality sources of them can be pretty expensive.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.780]   And then of course, when they're not in season,
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.620]   they're hard to get.
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.060]   And so that's why some people will supplement with them.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:04.060]   So that range of about 400 to about 600 milligrams per day
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.260]   seems to be the minimum threshold
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:12.260]   for getting a cognitive effect in these elderly patients.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.000]   In that case, they were patients.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.940]   A good review about the anthocyanins
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.900]   potentially contributing to offsetting cognitive decline
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.460]   in things like Alzheimer's
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.940]   and also enhancing brain function
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.260]   in people that don't have Alzheimer's
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.340]   is a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L,
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.180]   that was published in 2019.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.160]   We will also provide a link to that study in the caption.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.260]   When one looks across the total batch of studies
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.980]   that are out there on this,
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.160]   it appears that if one is going to supplement
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.700]   with blueberry extract
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.460]   to get the anthocyanin effect on cognition,
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.580]   dosages of somewhere between five and a half
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.380]   or about 11 grams seem optimal
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.520]   with the higher end closer to 10 or 11 grams
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.380]   being more beneficial.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.360]   The blueberry eaters out there like me
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.300]   who prefer to get their anthocyanins from the actual berries,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.420]   it appears that somewhere between 60 to 120 grams
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.500]   of fresh blueberries each day
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.180]   is the way that you can get a sufficient anthocyanins
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.920]   to at least shift your system or bias your brain
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.900]   towards these enhanced cognitive effects.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.820]   So we've got EPA fatty acids,
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.780]   we've got phosphatidylserine, we've got choline,
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.100]   we've got creatine, and we have the anthocyanins.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.900]   And the last item that I'd like to place
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.600]   in this list of food-derived things
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.500]   that can enhance brain function is glutamine.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.680]   Glutamine is a very interesting amino acid.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.940]   I've talked about glutamine on here before.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.080]   There's some evidence, although somewhat scant,
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.020]   there's some evidence that glutamine
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.820]   can enhance immune system function.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.520]   So people will supplement with glutamine
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.840]   or people can get glutamine from foods.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.200]   Foods that contain a lot of glutamine
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.640]   are things like cottage cheese.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.040]   There are also other sources of glutamine.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.680]   Glutamine is rich in protein-rich foods,
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.240]   things like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs,
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   but also for you non-animal food-consuming people out there,
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.680]   vegetables, including beans, cabbage once again,
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.040]   spinach, parsley, things of that sort.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.480]   So those foods contain glutamine.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.380]   For people that supplement with glutamine,
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.600]   generally they will take anywhere from a gram
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.120]   as much as 10 grams per day.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.100]   Why would they want to do that?
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.360]   Well, there's also some evidence starting to emerge
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.400]   that glutamine can help offset sugar cravings.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.540]   And I've talked about this on the podcast before.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.160]   We're going to talk more about the basis for this
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.500]   a little bit later, but in brief,
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.620]   we all have neurons in our gut
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.760]   that sense the amino acid content, the fat content,
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.620]   and the sugar content of the foods that we eat
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.360]   and signal in a subconscious way to our brain
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.760]   whether or not the foods that we are eating
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.640]   contain certain levels of certain amino acids.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.260]   And so we actually have glutamine-sensing neurons
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.260]   in our gut that actually have their little processes,
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.800]   their little axons and dendrites, as we call them,
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.220]   in the mucosal lining of the gut.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.560]   They're not just sensing glutamine,
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.060]   but when they do sense glutamine, they respond,
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.660]   and they send signals to the brain
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:17.400]   that are signals of satiation, of satisfaction.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.120]   And in doing so can offset some of the sugar cravings
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.080]   that many people suffer from.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.460]   Now, here, we're talking about glutamine
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.980]   for sake of enhancing cognitive function.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.920]   And this is interesting because it's been shown
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.340]   that glutamine supplementation can offset
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.480]   some of the negative effects on cognition
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   caused by altitude and oxygen deprivation of other sorts.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.840]   Okay, well, that's kind of a strange and unique situation.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.720]   If you're going up to altitude,
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.280]   should you supplement with glutamine
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.960]   in order to be able to think more clearly?
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.240]   Well, it appears that there's good rationale for doing that.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.360]   But the reason I bring this up,
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.020]   assuming that most people, including me,
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.760]   are not going up to high altitudes very often,
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.520]   is that it's been well-established
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.200]   that apnea, failure to breathe properly during sleep,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.320]   can contribute to age-related
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.860]   and even non-age-related cognitive decline.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.720]   There are a lot of reasons for apneas,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:18.560]   ranging from obesity to obstruction of the airways
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.580]   for other reasons.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.960]   There are a tremendous number of underlying causes of apnea,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.440]   and it's something to be taken seriously.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.080]   I mean, heart attacks,
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.340]   all sorts of metabolic issues are caused by apnea.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.660]   Apnea is a serious issue that disrupts the depth of sleep,
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.280]   and it's a serious health issue in general.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.000]   In any event, apnea is associated with cognitive decline
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.880]   and cognitive dysfunction, even in young people.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.080]   And it does appear that glutamine supplementation
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.200]   can offset some of the cognitive deficits
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.520]   that are associated with reduced oxygenation of the brain.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.240]   If you'd like to learn more about how apnea
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.760]   can negatively impact cognition,
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.920]   there's an excellent paper
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.760]   that was published on this in 2018.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.280]   The first author is Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.360]   It should be easy to find.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.200]   The title of the paper is
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.080]   Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity Effects Amyloid Burden
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.120]   in Cognitively Normal Elderly.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.780]   This was a longitudinal study.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:17.520]   Amyloid burden is a correlate of Alzheimer's
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.560]   and other forms of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.420]   associated with memory deficits.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   So obstructive sleep apnea is a very serious issue
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.600]   for which glutamine appears to be able to offset
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.860]   some of the negative symptomology.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.680]   So how is it that glutamine,
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.440]   either from food or through supplementation,
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.760]   can offset some of these so-called hypoxic effects
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.860]   caused by sleep apnea,
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.640]   hypoxia being a lack of oxygen for the brain
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.500]   that relate to cognitive decline.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.060]   It appears to have this positive impact
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.540]   by way of reducing inflammation.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.160]   So if you want to look more deeply
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.900]   into the various biological pathways
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.400]   and the supplementation regimes for this,
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.660]   the paper that I think is really spectacular is a paper,
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:09.660]   last author is Quaresma, Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.600]   That's Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.500]   It's a review the possible importance
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.540]   of glutamine supplementation to mood and cognition
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.500]   in hypoxia from high altitude.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.060]   And even though the paper is about
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.220]   high altitude induced hypoxia,
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.240]   it does seem to have direct relevance
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.140]   to the sorts of apnea that are related to Alzheimer's
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.900]   and other forms of cognitive decline.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.660]   Now I've been taking glutamine as a supplement, gosh,
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.640]   since I was in college,
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.620]   mostly because I felt either by superstition or by reality
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:43.320]   that it protected me from various flus and colds
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.340]   and things of that sort
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.700]   because of the purported immune enhancing effects.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.160]   Again, those immune enhancing effects
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   have some data to support them, not a ton.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.300]   However, I got into the habit of taking glutamine
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.600]   and now that I've learned that glutamine
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.320]   seems to also have some cognitive enhancing effects,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.400]   possibly, it's a supplement that I continue to take.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.960]   I take very small amounts of it,
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.640]   but I do take it on a regular basis.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.640]   So that more or less completes the list of things
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.920]   that at least by my read of the literature
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.700]   are things that are supported by at least three
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.780]   and in some cases, as many as hundreds of studies
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.980]   in various populations that have been explored
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.460]   in mouse studies often,
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.200]   but also in a number of human studies.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.340]   I want to emphasize again that all of the things
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.580]   I listed out, whether or not it's EPAs,
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.280]   whether or not it's phosphatidylserine,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.260]   whether or not it's choline,
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.560]   whether or not it's the various compounds
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.880]   that are in berries, et cetera,
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.080]   all of those can be extracted from food.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.100]   There is not any law that says that you have to get them
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.000]   from supplementation.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.920]   Supplementation can help you get to the very high levels
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.320]   of those things if you want to work on the higher end,
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   if that's right for you,
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.520]   obviously check with your doctor before taking anything
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.320]   or removing anything from your diet or supplement regime.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.000]   But in general, you can get these things from foods.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.660]   It's just so happens that for some of these compounds,
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.280]   the foods that they're contained in like fish
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.000]   are not foods that I particularly enjoy.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.180]   And so I rely on, excuse me,
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.680]   I rely on supplements in order to get
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.160]   sufficient levels for me.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.580]   But again, you can get these levels from food.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.520]   And the reason I made this list,
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.240]   the reason that I emphasize these things
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.960]   in this particular order is that they support
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   the structure of neurons.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.780]   They support the structure of the other cells of the brain
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.220]   that make up our cognition and that are important
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.880]   for our focus and our ability to remember things
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   and so forth.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.980]   And they are less so in the category
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.280]   of so-called modulatory effects.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.300]   They will also have modulatory effects on sleep,
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.220]   on inflammation or reducing inflammation
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.640]   throughout the body, on cardiovascular function,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.300]   all of which I believe are positive effects,
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.080]   at least what the literature tells us
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.000]   is that none of these compounds are harming other systems
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.080]   of the body provided they are taken at reasonable levels.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.260]   But everything in this list is directed
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.240]   towards answering the question, what can I eat?
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.000]   What can I ingest by way of food and or food supplement
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.760]   that can support brain function in the short-term
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.720]   and in the long-term?
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.580]   So I hope you find that list beneficial for you,
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.920]   if not for use, at least for consideration.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.420]   So now having talked about some of the foods
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.380]   and micronutrients that are beneficial
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.480]   to our immediate and long-term brain health,
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.940]   I'd like to shift gears somewhat and talk about
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.400]   why it is that we like the foods that we like.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.560]   We've all heard before that we are hardwired
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.920]   to pursue sugar and to like fatty foods
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.080]   and that calorie-rich foods are attractive to us
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.260]   for all sorts of reasons,
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.640]   surviving famines and things of that sort.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.080]   And while that is true,
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.820]   the actual mechanisms that underlie food seeking
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.640]   and food preference are far more interesting than that.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.080]   There are basically three channels in our body
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.480]   and nervous system by which we decide what foods to pursue,
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.980]   how much to eat, and whether or not we will find
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.700]   a particular food attractive,
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.140]   whether or not we will want to consume more of it,
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.340]   whether or not we want to avoid it,
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.460]   or whether or not it's just sort of so-so,
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.460]   what I refer to as the yum, yuck, or meh analysis.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.480]   And indeed, that's what our nervous system is doing
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.500]   with respect to food.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.420]   It's trying to figure out whether or not yum,
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:31.860]   I want more of this, yuck, I want to avoid this,
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.840]   or meh, it's so-so.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.380]   Now, while that may seem like a overly simplified version
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.640]   of food seeking and food preference,
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.040]   it's actually not that far from the truth.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.560]   It actually correctly captures much of the biology
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.240]   of food preference.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.160]   So let's talk about what these three channels
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.040]   for food preference are.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.080]   The first one is an obvious one.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.160]   It's taste on the mouth.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.640]   It is the sensation that we have of the foods
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.880]   that we eat while we're chewing them.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.320]   And those sensations,
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.300]   which are literally just somatosensory touch sensations,
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.720]   you know, the palatability of food
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.920]   as it relates to the consistency of food.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.280]   That's important.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.040]   And as you've all heard before,
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.300]   we have sensors on our tongue and elsewhere in our mouth
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.400]   that detect the various chemicals contained within food
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.560]   and lead to the senses of taste,
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.200]   which we call bitter, sweet, umami, salty, and sour.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.900]   Now, most of us are familiar with the sense of bitterness
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.760]   that comes from something like a raw radish,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.700]   sweet, which comes obviously from sugars of different kinds,
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:41.700]   fructose, glucose, et cetera, salty, salty, and sour.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:46.040]   Think lemon or lemon juice, for instance.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.040]   And then I mentioned umami.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.660]   The umami receptor is a receptor
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.720]   that responds to the savory taste of things.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.460]   So that's what you might find
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.460]   in a really wonderfully rich tomato sauce
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.480]   for those of you that eat meat and like meat.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.920]   A really well-cooked, not necessarily well done,
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.540]   but properly cooked, I should say, steak,
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.800]   if that's your thing.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.480]   And umami is present in both plant and animal foods
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.320]   and gives us that sensation of savoriness.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.780]   It almost has a kind of little bit of a briny taste to it
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.400]   or braised taste to it.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.120]   And indeed, braising of meats and braising of vegetables
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.580]   is done specifically to activate that umami receptor.
[00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.660]   So we have those five basic tastes.
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.660]   Those are chemical sensors on the tongue
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:37.440]   that what we call transduce those chemicals,
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.800]   those chemicals literally in food bind to those receptors,
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.880]   and it is transduced,
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.860]   meaning the binding of those chemicals to the receptors
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.960]   is converted into an electrical signal
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.760]   that travels in from the tongue
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.940]   along what's called the gustatory nerve.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:55.600]   The gustatory nerve then synapses,
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.320]   meaning it makes connections in our brainstem,
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.960]   in the so-called nucleus of the solitary tract.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.560]   There are other nuclei back there.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   Nuclei are just aggregates of neurons.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.120]   And then it sends information up
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.560]   to the so-called insular cortex, to the insula.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.640]   I want to highlight the insula this episode
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.680]   because we are going to return to the insula
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.460]   again and again in this episode and later.
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:21.480]   The insular cortex is a incredible structure
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.540]   that we all have that mainly is concerned
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.660]   with so-called interoception or our perception
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.820]   of what's going on inside our body.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.460]   So it could be the amount of pressure in our gut
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.200]   because of how much food we've eaten.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.420]   It could be the acidity of our gut
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.820]   if we're having a little bit of indigestion, for instance.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.820]   It can also be the case that neurons within the insula
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.760]   are paying attention to how stressed you are
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.820]   or how alert you are or how tired you are.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.920]   So it's really an inward focusing structure.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.000]   It focuses on how we feel internally.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.920]   And not surprisingly, the taste system sends information
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.600]   up to the insular cortex to give us a sense, literally,
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.680]   of what we've ingested,
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.040]   whether or not what we're tasting tastes good or not.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.080]   We will return to insular cortex in a few moments.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.480]   A very important thing to understand is that the neurons
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.080]   in the areas of the cortex, your cortex and mine,
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.980]   that respond to particular tastes
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.940]   are providing an internal representation
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.840]   of an external sense.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.820]   What do I mean by that?
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.760]   I don't want to be at all abstract.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.360]   We take these foods, we break them down in our mouth
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.440]   by chewing them or sucking on them,
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.920]   whatever it is that food happens to be.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.620]   Those chemicals bind to those receptors
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.960]   and electrical signals are sent into the brain,
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.640]   but they are just electrical signals,
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.000]   just like notes being played on the keys of a piano
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.080]   there's no unique signature for salty or sweet.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:53.080]   It is the relative activation of one set of neurons
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.880]   that was activated by sweet or another set of neurons
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.520]   that was activated by umami.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.540]   It's that relative activation traveling into the brain
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:05.500]   in essentially the same form, the same electrical signals.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.560]   This is really incredible, right?
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.320]   Electrical signals are sent into the brain and you say,
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.960]   "Aha, that's sweet and I want more of it."
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.520]   Or, "That's bitter, I want less of it."
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.380]   Or, "That's umami flavored and I really, really like that,
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.920]   really like savory foods as I happen to."
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.960]   That should immediately strike you as incredible
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.000]   because it means that your representation
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.240]   of what you want more of or less of is electrical in nature.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.040]   And to really tamp this issue down,
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:36.000]   studies that were done by Charles Zucker, Z-U-K-E-R,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.120]   he's a absolutely phenomenal neuroscientist
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.100]   at Columbia University in New York.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:47.000]   Studies done by the Zucker lab have shown that,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.400]   first of all, they could identify the neurons in the cortex
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   deep in the brain that respond to a sweet taste
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.360]   or to a bitter taste.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.400]   It turns out they are non-overlapping populations of neurons.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.040]   And then using some molecular tricks,
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:05.600]   they were able to either silence or activate the neurons
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.780]   that, for instance, respond to sweet.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.240]   When they do this,
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.320]   they see incredible consequences on perception
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.880]   that indeed occur in your brain and my brain as well
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.180]   all the time without these kinds of manipulations.
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.280]   Here's the experiment.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:27.240]   They have a subject drink water that contains sugar
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.620]   or drink water that contains a salty substance
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.720]   or drink water that contains a bitter substance,
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.780]   for instance, okay?
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:36.040]   I'm sort of paraphrasing a large amount of work.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.940]   They identify the neurons that respond to sweet tastes.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:44.760]   They see, as many researchers have seen,
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.920]   that subjects prefer sweet taste to other tastes
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.480]   and certainly sweet taste to bitter
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.060]   or sweet taste to nothing, so to plain water.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:55.400]   And then they go in and they are able
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:00.140]   to selectively silence the neurons that represent sweet.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:02.240]   And when they do that,
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.120]   they eliminate the preference for that sweet taste.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.580]   Now, that might seem obvious.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.680]   The neurons respond to sweet.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.640]   You silence those neurons.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.620]   They no longer seek out sweet.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.760]   But that should strike you also as incredible
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.240]   because they're not actually changing
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.480]   what's happening on the tongue
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.320]   or in the deeper layers of the brain.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:27.600]   Conversely, they can have subjects drink bitter water
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.740]   or plain water while activating,
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:34.080]   selectively activating the neurons that respond to sweet.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.680]   And what they find is that then subjects
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   will actively prefer bitter or plain water
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:46.360]   to actual preferences such as sweet.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.000]   So what this means is that your perception
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.400]   of what you like is a central,
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.480]   meaning deep within the brain, phenomenon.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   It's not about how things taste on your mouth.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.200]   Now, of course, under normal conditions
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.280]   where there aren't these experimental manipulations
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.440]   being done, those things are positively correlated.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.180]   Sweet tastes trigger the activation of sweet neurons,
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.760]   for instance, neurons in the mouth that respond to umami
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.820]   trigger the activation of neurons in the brain
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.640]   that respond to umami and so forth.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.560]   So they're correlated in a way that makes you
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.980]   seek out the things that you like
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.220]   and avoid the things that you don't like.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.720]   But as we'll see in a few minutes,
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.060]   turns out that that is not a direct relationship
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.480]   that is hardwired.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   You can actually uncouple the preference
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:36.400]   for particular tastes with the reward systems in the brain
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.900]   in a way that, for instance, would allow you to eat,
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.360]   or I should use myself as an example
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.800]   'cause I don't particularly like fish.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.200]   I've had a few meals that included fish
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:49.200]   that were pretty good, but none of them were memorable
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.320]   in the kind of positive way,
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.000]   like some other events in my life are memorable.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.760]   But by way of these circuitries
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.280]   and the way they link up with one another,
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.380]   it's actually possible to rewire one's sense of taste
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:03.200]   and preference for particular foods.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.800]   If this is seeming at all vague to you,
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.220]   just hang in with me a little bit longer
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:08.920]   because I will provide you with the information,
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.100]   tools, and resources with which to navigate this process.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.640]   But the most important thing to understand
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:20.300]   is that like with our hearing, like with vision,
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:26.440]   like with smell, taste is an internal representation
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:31.800]   that has particular goals for you.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.760]   Your sense of what tastes good is related
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.560]   to particular things that are occurring
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.760]   in your brain and body and that are likely
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.500]   to give your brain and body the things that it needs.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.520]   It is not simply a matter of what you quote unquote like
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.160]   or what tastes good or what doesn't taste good.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:50.100]   Let me give you a relatively simple example
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:53.220]   of how your body and your brain are acting
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.960]   in a coordinated way to make you prefer certain foods
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.340]   and indeed to pursue certain foods more.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.500]   So I just mentioned you have neurons on your tongue
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.240]   that respond to different tastes,
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.880]   but of course your digestive tract isn't just your tongue,
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.220]   it's also your throat, it goes all the way down
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.880]   to your stomach and of course your intestines.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.700]   Here's a long tube of digestion.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.640]   All along that tube, there are neurons.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.240]   Some of the neurons are responding to the mechanical size
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.040]   of whatever portion of the digestive tract
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.880]   it happens to be.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:28.720]   So for instance, how distended or empty or full rather,
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   and it doesn't have to be distended,
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.580]   depends on how much you ate,
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.800]   but how full or empty your gut happens to be,
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.380]   whether or not something you just ate is temperature hot,
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.080]   you know, is hot in the sense of hot to the touch
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.940]   or whether or not it's spicy hot,
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.240]   whether or not it's soothing,
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.640]   whether or not it's kind of hard to swallow,
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.560]   this kind of thing.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   So you have neurons all along your gut
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.240]   that are responding to the mechanics related to food
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.620]   and digestion, and that are related to the chemistry
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.800]   of food and digestion.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.400]   There's a population of neurons, nerve cells in your gut
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.160]   that are exquisitely tuned to the chemistry
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.160]   of whatever it is in your gut.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.560]   And these are neurons called neuropod cells.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.480]   They were discovered many, many years ago,
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   but really defined with and classified with modern tools
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.840]   by Diego Borges, I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.460]   Diego, we've spoken many times,
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.120]   but I can't ever seem to quite capture
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.240]   the proper pronunciation just right.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.440]   But Diego Borges at Duke University,
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.440]   who discovered that these cells reside within the gut
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.020]   and place little processes,
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.600]   they're little axons and dendrites
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.060]   within the mucosal lining of the gut.
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.800]   And there they are paying attention to,
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.720]   meaning they respond to amino acids,
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.760]   sugars, and fatty acids.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.000]   So as your food is digested,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.180]   as food lands within your gut,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.960]   neurons there are sensing what types of foods are available
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.320]   and what types of things are making their way
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.000]   through the gut environment.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.440]   Now those neurons aren't actually taking those foods
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.400]   and doing much with them.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.980]   What they're doing is they're essentially surveying
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.640]   what qualities of food are there.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.720]   And these particular neurons that Diego
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.500]   and his group discovered send electrical signals
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.720]   up into the brain through a little passage
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.640]   that we call the nodos ganglion,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.240]   that nodos ganglia is a cluster of neurons
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.680]   that then go first, send their own process into the brain
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.320]   and trigger the release of dopamine,
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.160]   which is a molecule that inspires motivation, reward,
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.280]   and more seeking for whatever it is led to their activation.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.820]   These are super interesting neurons
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.940]   because what they're essentially doing
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:53.300]   is they are providing a subconscious signal
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.660]   about the quality of the food that you're eating,
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.500]   what it contains, and then triggering the release
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.380]   of a molecule within your brain, dopamine,
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.160]   that leads you to go seek more of those foods.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.900]   Now this has profound impact on a number of things.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.420]   First of all, there's the consideration
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.340]   of so-called hidden sugars.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.420]   Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.740]   at University of California, San Francisco,
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:23.180]   has been among the most prominent researchers
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.640]   to talk about the fact that there are
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.420]   the so-called hidden sugars in foods.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:29.160]   Now, these are not just sugars that they sneak in
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.380]   just to be sneaky.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.860]   These are sugars that are literally snuck in
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.480]   in a way that you can't taste them.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.140]   That's why they're called hidden sugars.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.160]   It's not that they just put them in there for fun.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.740]   These are sugars that are placed into processed foods
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.840]   that are designed to trigger activation of these mechanisms
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.060]   to lead you to want to eat more of these foods,
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.240]   but not because they necessarily taste sweet or delicious,
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   but because they are activating
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.580]   these subconscious mechanisms that are driving you
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.040]   to pursue more of these foods.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.960]   Sounds like a very diabolical strategy,
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.580]   and indeed it is somewhat of a diabolical strategy.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.440]   However, these neurons are also involved
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.600]   in signaling to your brain when, for instance,
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.460]   you are eating a food that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.820]   the fatty acids that we were talking about earlier.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.840]   So why is it that you don't crave salmon?
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.260]   Why is it that I don't sit around
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:22.980]   daydreaming about mackerel?
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.820]   Well, because there's also the influence
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.580]   of the actual taste on the mouth.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.940]   Under normal conditions, it's a combination
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.380]   of the taste of the thing on the mouth
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.060]   plus the subconscious signaling from the gut.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.280]   And while this isn't a discussion about gut microbiome,
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.140]   I should just mention that it's very clear
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.620]   that having a healthy gut microbiome
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.780]   allows these neurons to function
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.260]   in a way that serves our seeking of healthy foods
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.860]   in positive ways.
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.500]   And without getting into a lot of detail about this,
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.060]   the best way to ensure a healthy gut microbiome
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.560]   that I am aware of is not necessarily
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.240]   to take supplemental prebiotics or probiotics.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.180]   There are actually some reasons
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.220]   why you might not want to do that,
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.460]   but rather to ingest two to four servings
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.300]   of fermented foods that are low in sugar each day.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.060]   There is a recent study published in Cell
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:16.680]   showing that the ingestion of fermented foods,
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.140]   two to four servings each day,
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:24.880]   can enhance the quality of the mucosal lining of the gut
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.380]   that allows certain gut microbiota to flourish
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.120]   and the gut microbiota that are not good for us
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.720]   to not flourish 'cause that's the environment
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.880]   that they settle down into.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.880]   This is work that was carried out by my colleagues,
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.140]   Justin Sonnenberg, which is in the laboratory upstairs
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.640]   for me, as well as Chris Gardner and others at Stanford.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.900]   They're certainly not the only researchers exploring this,
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.360]   but it does appear that two to four servings
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.240]   of fermented foods each day,
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.240]   so these would be things like natto, sauerkraut,
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.380]   low sugar fermented foods is great for the gut microbiome,
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:01.440]   and separate studies, not their study,
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.280]   but separate studies have shown that the correct gut
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.680]   microbiome conditions allow these neurons
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.320]   that signal to the brain to signal at the right times
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.660]   and in the right ways to promote healthy food seeking.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.440]   Many people opt to supplement with capsule form probiotics.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:21.780]   There are some data that suggest that maybe
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:25.360]   those don't contain the correct prebiotics and probiotics
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.900]   for setting the correct gut microbiota conditions.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.660]   That's a little bit of a controversial issue.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:36.280]   Nonetheless, getting probiotics from fermented foods
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.440]   is probably the simplest and most straightforward way.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.660]   It's also the way that we evolved to do that over many,
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.260]   at least hundreds and probably thousands
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.140]   or even tens or hundreds of thousands of years
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.320]   people have been ingesting fermented foods,
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.220]   not just for their taste,
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.500]   but for their health benefits as well.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.420]   So now I've mentioned two of the three mechanisms
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.900]   by which we prefer certain foods.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.900]   One is from the actual taste that we're familiar with,
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.780]   the taste on our tongue and in our mouth
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:05.260]   and the sensations that make us go mm or uh or eh,
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.340]   the yum yuck meh responses, as I referred to them earlier.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.340]   And then there's this subconscious signaling
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.740]   coming from the gut that's really based
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.720]   on the nutrient content of the foods.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.500]   There's a third pathway,
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.520]   which is the learned association of a particular taste
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.920]   with the particular quality or value that a food has.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.000]   And this is where things get really interesting
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.120]   and where there's actually a leverage point
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.820]   for you to rewire what it is that you find tasty
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.640]   and that you want to seek more of.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.020]   The work I'd like to talk about next
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.440]   has been carried out in mouse models
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.280]   and has been carried out in parallel experiments in humans.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.360]   This is largely, not exclusively,
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:53.360]   but largely the work of Ivan de Araujo and Dana Small.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:58.700]   Ivan de Araujo is at Mount Sinai School of Medicine
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.900]   and Dana Small is at Yale.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.780]   And they and others in their field
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.860]   have done incredible experiments
[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.280]   exploring how taste and food value,
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.340]   the nutritional value of food
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:15.120]   and the impact of that food on metabolism in the brain
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.380]   drives our food choices and allows us to change
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.240]   our food choices for the better.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.160]   Their groups have done some really amazing studies
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.800]   involving ingestion of a particular substance
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.980]   that either contains sugar
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:33.900]   and thereby can elevate glucose, blood sugar or not.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.240]   And varying, meaning changing the taste
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.120]   associated with that ingestion of sugar.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.280]   So let me just give you a simple example
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.800]   where they have subjects,
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.420]   these could be mice or these could be humans
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.280]   'cause they've done both sets of studies,
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:55.280]   drink sweet water as an alternative or a choice
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.600]   to non-sweetened water or bitter water or some other flavor.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.620]   What they find is that mice and humans
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:05.080]   will prefer to consume the sweet beverage.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.500]   Now it's not always sweet water.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.920]   Mice like sweet water, but humans will prefer,
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.720]   for instance, a milkshake, a fatty sweet drink.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:18.120]   They'll consume more of that and not surprisingly,
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.740]   dopamine levels in the brain increase in response to that.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.640]   So the taste and the nutrient content
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.640]   of what it is that they're ingesting are aligned,
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.600]   they are matched.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:36.300]   They've also done experiments where they have no taste,
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:39.220]   but subjects are being infused with sugar
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:43.040]   directly into the gut and not surprisingly,
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.120]   based on everything I've told you up until now,
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.940]   subjects will pursue more of that thing
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.600]   relative to some other taste,
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.200]   either neutral or negative taste,
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.440]   because that sugar in the gut
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.160]   is triggering the activation of the neurons
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.060]   I mentioned earlier, which is signaling to the brain
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.920]   to pursue more of that thing.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.480]   So this tells us something important.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.060]   It tells us that we are driven,
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.180]   meaning we have mechanisms in our brain
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.120]   that make us motivated to pursue
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.360]   more of what brings both a taste of sweetness,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.680]   but also that brings actual changes
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.720]   in blood glucose levels up.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.560]   So we are motivated to eat sweet things,
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.040]   not just because they taste good,
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.840]   but because they change our blood sugar level,
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.960]   they increase our blood sugar level.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.440]   This is important because it needn't be the case.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.400]   It could have been that we were just wired
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.300]   to pursue things that taste good.
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.200]   But what this tells us is that we are actually wired
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.280]   to pursue things that increase our blood glucose.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:46.440]   So much so that when the small lab,
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.200]   it's not a small lab, it's actually a big lab,
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.440]   but when Dana Small's lab and/or Ivan de Araujo's lab
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.560]   have done experiments where they use a compound
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.280]   called 2-deoxyglucose.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.660]   This is a compound that can prevent glucose
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:03.940]   from being metabolized by neurons.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.960]   So blood glucose is going up, but neurons can't use it.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.040]   What they find is that the reinforcing
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.920]   or the rewarding properties of a food or taste
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.320]   are eliminated.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.080]   Put simply, it is not sufficient
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.320]   for a food to taste good consciously.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.700]   It is not sufficient for a food to increase blood sugar.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.200]   You need blood sugar to go up and that blood sugar,
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.840]   glucose has to be utilized by the neurons,
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.360]   even if it's not associated with a good taste
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.880]   and to make it even simpler, if this isn't sinking in,
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.580]   this should make it very clear.
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:45.920]   What your brain, meaning what you are seeking when you eat
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.160]   is not taste, is not dopamine,
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.620]   is not even a rise in blood glucose.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.200]   What you're seeking, even though you don't realize it
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.300]   because it's subconscious, is you are seeking things
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.880]   that allow your neurons to be metabolically active.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.520]   And this is fundamentally important for understanding
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.960]   why you eat particular foods
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.840]   and how you can change your relationship to those foods.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.000]   Now, earlier, I referred to circuits that are wired
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.840]   for a particular outcome.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.100]   And in biology and in particular neuroscience,
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.000]   we refer to things that are either hardwired,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.140]   meaning immutable and unchangeable, or softwired.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.820]   A good example of soft wiring would be the areas
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:32.240]   of your brain that are responsible for speech and language
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:37.520]   are always more or less in the same place in your brain
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.440]   and everyone else's brain.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.400]   However, they are not hardwired to speak French
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.760]   or to speak English or to speak Chinese or to speak German,
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.600]   because depending on where you were born
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.600]   and the parents that you're born to,
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.280]   you need to be able to speak one
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.780]   or maybe even more languages.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.580]   The taste system and this general system
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:01.600]   of seeking particular foods similarly is hardwired
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.160]   to obtain certain types of nutrients.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.680]   It tends to like sweet things.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.520]   Most children naturally like sweet things,
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.840]   some more than others,
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.440]   but naturally most people from childhood onward
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.100]   don't particularly crave very bitter substances,
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.320]   maybe mildly bitter, but not very bitter.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.640]   So there's some hard wiring of preference,
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.260]   but there's also some soft wiring in the system
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.620]   that allows it to change.
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:26.200]   The groups I mentioned earlier
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.160]   have done some really beautiful experiments
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.760]   looking at how artificial sweeteners interact
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.440]   with the actual sweet sensing system.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.080]   And this gets right down to a number of issues.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.960]   First of all, it gets to the issue
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.180]   of how we can rewire our taste system
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.880]   in ways that serve us for better or for worse.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.480]   Second of all, it gets right down to the issue
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.240]   of whether or not artificial sweeteners are good for us
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.480]   or bad for us.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.680]   And indeed, as of just this last year,
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.980]   we now have an answer to that question.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:00.020]   And turns out it depends.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.460]   And I will tell you in a few minutes
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:06.120]   when it is okay to ingest artificial sweeteners
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.960]   and when it is very detrimental
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.340]   to ingest artificial sweeteners of any kind.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.080]   Regardless, I'm not going to name off brand names,
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.180]   but there are different forms
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.940]   of these artificial sweeteners nowadays.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.560]   And there are various forms
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.200]   of non-caloric plant-based sweeteners
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.640]   for which the same information
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.920]   that I'm about to tell you applies.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.860]   Okay, so the experiments that were done
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:31.340]   beautifully illustrate that you seek out particular foods
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:33.260]   because of the way they taste,
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.340]   because of their impact on blood glucose levels,
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.560]   but also on their impact on the dopamine system,
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.200]   even if your blood glucose levels don't change.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.460]   So here's the experiment.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.840]   One group of subjects is given a sweet taste
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.280]   of a substance that also raises blood glucose levels,
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.640]   blood sugar, and dopamine goes up, not surprisingly.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.120]   Second condition, separate subjects,
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.180]   consume an artificial sweetener or a non-caloric sweetener.
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.580]   It is not preferred much over other substances,
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.560]   but it is sweet, so it's preferred somewhat,
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.720]   and it does not cause an increase in blood glucose levels.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.360]   And not surprisingly, dopamine levels don't go up.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360]   So initially, we don't tend to like
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.660]   artificial sweeteners that much.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.060]   That's the simple way of putting it.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.780]   However, if subjects continue
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.520]   to ingest artificial sweeteners,
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.660]   even though there's no increase in blood glucose level
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.960]   and therefore no increase in brain metabolism,
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.340]   dopamine levels eventually start to rise.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:37.520]   And when those dopamine levels eventually start to rise,
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.020]   you've essentially conditioned or reinforced
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:43.900]   that artificial or non-caloric sweetener,
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.840]   and then subjects start to consume more of it,
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.660]   and they actually get a dopamine increase from it.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.380]   So that's interesting.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.780]   It says that consuming more of these artificial sweeteners
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.100]   or consuming them for a longer period of time
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.980]   can start to tap into the dopamine system
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.100]   and lead us to seek out
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.860]   or consume more of these artificial sweeteners.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.000]   Many people are probably familiar with this
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.060]   because we tend to, or I should say people report
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.100]   that when they ingest these artificial sweeteners,
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.280]   at first, they don't taste very good,
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.400]   but then over time, they seem kind of tolerable,
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.540]   and then maybe even pleasurable,
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.980]   and then some people feel quote unquote addicted
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:17.980]   to various diet sodas and things of that sort.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:21.900]   Now, there's another condition that's been explored,
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.780]   and that's the really interesting condition.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.700]   And it's the condition where an artificial sweetener
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:31.240]   is paired with a substance that can increase blood sugar,
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.700]   but not because it tastes sugary
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.940]   like a normal sweet substance.
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.780]   So now there's an artificial sweetener
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:42.060]   that's coupled with an actual increase in blood glucose.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:45.140]   The natural world scenario where this would happen
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:48.520]   would be drinking a diet soda, which contains no calories
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.220]   and therefore would not increase blood glucose,
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:54.620]   but is sweet with a food that increases blood glucose.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:58.300]   And when that happens, what you're essentially doing
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.020]   is tapping into the dopamine system.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.980]   This non-chloric sweet taste is paired with it,
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:07.540]   and there's an increase in neuron metabolism.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.420]   So you have all of the components for reinforcement.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.020]   And as a consequence, you get in a sort of Pavlovian
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:17.780]   conditioning way, a situation where later
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.620]   when you ingest that artificial sweetener,
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.740]   you actually get not only the increase in dopamine,
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:27.260]   but you get alterations in blood sugar management.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.440]   Now, blood sugar cannot go up if you don't ingest something
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.600]   that makes blood sugar go up.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.140]   So it's not as if you ingest artificial sweetener
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:38.380]   with some food that contains calories or sugar,
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.380]   and then later you remove the food
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:44.300]   and you just drink the soda and your blood glucose goes up.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.640]   Rather, it's a much worse situation.
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.780]   If you, I'll make this in the natural world context,
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:53.420]   if you ingest an artificial sweetener,
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.940]   say drink diet soda while consuming foods
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:01.300]   that increase blood glucose, then later,
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.140]   even if you just drink the diet soda,
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:08.100]   it's been shown that you secrete much more insulin,
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.980]   the hormone that regulates blood glucose
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.140]   in response to that diet soda.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.100]   Studies have been done in both adult humans
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:17.660]   and in human children.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.700]   In general, when we say children, we mean human children,
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.460]   but just to be very clear what we're talking about,
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.700]   exploring consuming diet soda with or without food,
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.780]   then later consuming just the diet soda.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.960]   And what they found was having previously consumed
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.700]   diet soda with food and then later only consuming
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:38.020]   the diet soda, of course, there isn't an increase
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:40.000]   in blood glucose because they're not bringing in
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.480]   any calories when they just drink the diet soda,
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:46.940]   but there is a significant increase in insulin release.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:50.340]   And that is serious in a terrible way
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.300]   because increased release of insulin
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.220]   and so-called insulin sensitivity
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.780]   is the basis for type 2 diabetes.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:00.280]   So much so that in the study with the children,
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.020]   consuming non-caloric beverages in this way,
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.040]   first with food and then on their own,
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.140]   led to increases in insulin that made them pre-diabetic
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.260]   and they actually had to halt the study.
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.620]   So I want to zoom out from this
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.780]   and just really illustrate the major findings
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.900]   and then talk about how this can be applied
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.740]   in the positive sense.
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.340]   I also want to mention what this means
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.140]   in terms of your consumption of artificial sweeteners
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.460]   of any kind.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.480]   So first of all, the direct takeaway
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:29.880]   about artificial sweeteners.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.580]   Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.260]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.000]   What I am going to say is that whether or not
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.080]   you ingest them alone or you ingest them
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.180]   in combination with foods or as part of foods,
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.340]   that raise blood glucose is vitally important
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.980]   for your insulin management.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.300]   And the simple extract or tool from this
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:53.620]   is if you are going to consume artificial sweeteners,
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:56.480]   it's very likely best to consume those
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.620]   away from any food that raises blood glucose levels.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:04.180]   So if you're going to enjoy diet soda, be my guest,
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:07.140]   but do it not while consuming food,
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.420]   in particular foods that raise blood glucose,
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.160]   because what these studies show,
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.080]   and I will provide references for these,
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:18.060]   is that they can vastly disrupt blood sugar management
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.820]   by way of the insulin glucose system, okay?
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:22.780]   And actually I'll just give you the reference now.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.420]   This is a paper from Dana Small's lab.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:30.100]   The first author is Dalenberg, D-A-L-E-N-B-E-R-G.
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.660]   And the title of the paper is short-term consumption
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.900]   of sucralose with, but not without carbohydrate,
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:39.720]   impairs neural and metabolic sensitivity to sugar in humans.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.540]   This is a paper published in Cell Metabolism
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.780]   in March of 2020.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.940]   I think it's a very important paper
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:48.420]   and similar findings have been addressed in mice
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.260]   and in other studies.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.540]   And now because of this paper,
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.920]   there's now a bunch of other groups working on this issue.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.820]   There's some evidence previously published in Nature,
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:02.620]   excellent top tier journal among the Super Bowl
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.740]   of top three journals being Nature Science and Cell.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.820]   Paper published in Nature a few years back
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.960]   showing that particular artificial sweeteners
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.720]   can disrupt the gut microbiome
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.520]   and have deleterious health effects.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.160]   That result I think stands,
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.660]   although there are some results that may not agree
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:21.900]   with that depending on whether or not
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.040]   the artificial sweetener is saccharin or sucralose
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.620]   or aspartame or stevia, that's the gut microbiome.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.720]   But what we are talking about here is independent
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.280]   of the form of artificial or non-chloric sweetener
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.000]   because it has everything to do with whether or not
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.120]   there is a match or a mismatch between the perceived taste
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.640]   and the effect of the thing that you are consuming
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.240]   on blood sugar and metabolism.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.920]   So the first takeaway from this is
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.760]   if you're going to consume artificial sweeteners,
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.500]   it's really important that you do that
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:57.660]   not in conjunction with foods that increase blood glucose.
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.140]   Second of all, it points to the fact
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:01.840]   that the foods that we prefer
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.700]   and the activation of the dopamine system
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:11.300]   both through the gut and at the level of conscious taste,
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:15.000]   in other words, what we like is very plastic,
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.440]   it's mutable and we can change it.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.620]   How can we change it?
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:22.300]   Well, earlier I mentioned a structure in the brain
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.480]   called the insula, this incredible structure
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.760]   that's involved in interoception
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.120]   and interoception of all kinds.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.900]   In fact, just as an aside, a year or so ago,
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:34.300]   my lab published a paper showing that
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:39.300]   activity within certain compartments of the insula of humans
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:44.160]   is responding to a heightened state of anxiety in the body.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.600]   It can respond to changes in our respiration,
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.720]   changes in our heart rate.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:51.160]   So this is, again, it's a readout of our internal state,
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.460]   not just of taste, but of many, many different aspects
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:58.600]   of the mechanics and chemistry of our internal milieu
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.280]   within our body.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.620]   All of the work that I was describing previously
[01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:06.460]   has also been addressed at the neural level
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.660]   and using a broad brush to explain these results,
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:14.420]   what we can say is when there is dopamine increase,
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:19.020]   one sees activation of the so-called nucleus accumbens,
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.360]   which is part of the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.560]   If you'd like to learn more about
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.380]   the mesolimbic reward pathway and dopamine in general
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:30.840]   and humans and in animal studies and all the various
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:34.080]   incredible and challenging things
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.940]   that dopamine can do for us,
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:39.000]   there's a episode all about dopamine that you can look up.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.700]   It's easy to find at hubermanlab.com.
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:45.700]   The increases in dopamine associated with sweet taste
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:49.560]   and or blood glucose elevating foods and drinks
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.720]   cause activation of the nucleus accumbens.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.520]   That's not surprising.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.740]   Also in the circuit is activation
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.880]   of the so-called arcuate nuclei within the hypothalamus.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.520]   These are areas of the hypothalamus
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.440]   that respond to hormones from the body
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.920]   and respond to hormones and neuropeptides in the brain,
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.180]   as well as neural signals in the brain
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:12.340]   to drive us to eat more or to stop eating.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:14.840]   So it's hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.160]   These are sort of the hypothalamus
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.440]   and the arcuate being the motivating to eat
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.740]   or motivating to stop eating.
[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:25.320]   Both sets of neurons are contained there.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.480]   There are other areas like the lateral hypothalamus as well,
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.160]   but hypothalamus is sort of the accelerator
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.300]   and the brake on eating.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:33.100]   And then the nucleus accumbens and dopamine release
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.820]   can be thought of as kind of a nitro boost, if you will,
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.440]   like the kids say, do the kids say that anymore?
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.900]   Anyway, a nitro boost to increase what we call the gain
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.800]   or the volume of how much you want more of something, okay?
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.840]   When dopamine is present, it's this kind of generic signal
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.280]   to go seek out more of whatever caused that release.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.920]   And then there's the insula,
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.800]   this very thoughtful, rational, not really,
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   it's not thinking, it's a brain area you're thinking,
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.420]   but it's part of the areas of your brain
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.360]   that are interpreting what's going on in your body,
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.900]   whether or not you feel good or not good,
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:11.680]   whether or not you feel anxious, excited, or fearful.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.320]   It's integrating all that information
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.340]   and fed into this entire circuit as well
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:20.520]   are the inputs from your prefrontal cortex,
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:24.400]   which is your thinking, rational, neuronal structure,
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.680]   if you will, informing you, for instance,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.580]   ah, well, I don't really like salmon very much,
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:36.580]   or I'm not so crazy about kale, but it has omega-3s,
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:41.520]   or it's rich in these polyphenols that are good for me.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.180]   And if one decides that they are going to eat these things,
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.320]   not just because they are good for them,
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.840]   but believe it or not, if one takes the perception
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.060]   or adopts the perception that they are both good for you
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:59.540]   and that in being good for you,
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.380]   they are good for your brain metabolism
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:06.380]   and that you desire to be healthy, as crazy as it sounds,
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.880]   those subjective signals of what you tell yourself
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.700]   about the foods that you're eating
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:16.120]   can actually impact how those foods will taste,
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   maybe not immediately, but eventually,
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.020]   and can impact the way in which
[01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:22.320]   your body utilizes those foods.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.520]   Now, that might seem like a absolute pipe dream.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.640]   If I just imagine that I like mackerel,
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.080]   mackerel will start to taste good.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:30.000]   I'm not saying that.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.160]   I didn't say that you could override yuck signals
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.280]   with this mechanism.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.560]   I didn't say that you could take a food
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.420]   that would be absolutely noxious to you
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.320]   or make you want to vomit and override that.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.280]   However, foods that are somewhat neutral to you
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.440]   can take on a different value
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.360]   based on the activation of the dopamine system.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360]   And now knowing what you know,
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.880]   there are a couple of ways that you could imagine doing that.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.360]   First of all, you could,
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.920]   in this so-called gedanken or thought experiment,
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.520]   you could, for instance, swap out sucralose,
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.600]   because sucralose is just a taste, right?
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.460]   It's an artificial sweet taste.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.380]   You could swap that out and insert kale,
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:19.780]   but eat the kale with something that raises blood glucose
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.980]   to some degree or another.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.140]   Now, I'm not encouraging anyone to run out there
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:25.660]   and spike their blood glucose like crazy.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:29.060]   And in fact, blood glucose isn't really the goal.
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:31.900]   If you recall, the goal is to get neurons
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:35.180]   to be metabolically active with that blood glucose, okay?
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.300]   That's what's actually rewarded at a subconscious level,
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.980]   meaning at a deep subconscious level.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.140]   But consuming these foods with other foods
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.380]   that increase blood glucose and thereby brain metabolism,
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:51.800]   or I suppose if you're ketogenic, you're in a ketosis,
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.900]   I don't know what the range of foods
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.180]   that are allowed on ketosis are,
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.340]   so I don't want to misspeak here and, you know,
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:59.560]   say cracker, which would probably be a sin
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.420]   in the context of ketosis, and no knock against ketosis.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.980]   I'm offering this in part because I think
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.020]   that there are a number of people that have
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.260]   and can positively benefit from a ketogenic diet.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.100]   But for instance,
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.220]   if there's a food that you want to consume more of,
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:18.880]   but that you find somewhat meh or mildly yuck even,
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.060]   pairing it with ketones, if indeed you are using ketones
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.860]   for your brain metabolism,
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.960]   'cause that's what happens on the ketogenic diet,
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.280]   over time, that food will be reinforced
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.260]   by the dopamine pathway.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.780]   We know this from these studies where sucralose
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:38.940]   was the substance paired with the glucose elevating,
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.960]   in other words, metabolically elevating food substance
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.780]   or liquid substance.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.980]   So how does one go about doing this?
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.220]   Well, first of all, I want to emphasize
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.820]   that this experiment actually has been done
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.580]   in a slightly different context.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.780]   Studies by my colleague, Alia Crum,
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:01.220]   in the psychology department at Stanford,
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:04.620]   have explored the bodily response
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:08.020]   in terms of insulin release and the release of other food
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.880]   and eating related hormones,
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:14.980]   as well as overall feelings of satisfaction, et cetera,
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:19.640]   in groups of people that drink a milkshake
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.280]   and are either told that it's a low calorie shake
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.540]   that contains various nutrients that are good for them,
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:29.400]   or a higher calorie shake that has a lot of nutrients,
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.980]   et cetera.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:33.800]   And what they found was that the different groups,
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.620]   and here, again, I'm being very general
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.340]   with my description of these studies,
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:40.980]   but what they found is that the physiological response,
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:43.420]   the insulin response, the blood glucose response,
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.560]   and the subjective measures
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.100]   of whether or not people enjoyed something or not
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:50.580]   were heavily influenced by what they were told
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.020]   were in these milkshakes.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.240]   So blood glucose would go up, insulin would go up
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.200]   when people were told it was a high calorie shake
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.240]   with lots of nutrients,
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.260]   less so when people ingested a shake
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:04.260]   that they were told had less nutrients and so forth,
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:09.660]   when in reality, it was the identical shake.
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.500]   This is incredible.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.800]   This is a belief effect.
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.520]   This is not placebo, right?
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.100]   A placebo effect is different.
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:16.860]   Placebo effect is in comparison.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.140]   It's where the control condition
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:23.140]   actually influences outcomes to a same or to some degree,
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:26.500]   just like the experimental condition.
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:27.700]   This is not a placebo effect.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.700]   This is a belief effect where the belief
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:35.220]   and the subjective thoughts about what a given food will do
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.300]   has a direct impact on a physiological measure
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.980]   like blood sugar and blood glucose, okay?
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:43.060]   So let's zoom out from this for a second
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:45.740]   and think about how we can incorporate this
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:50.100]   into adopting consumption of healthy foods
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:53.660]   that serve our brain health in the immediate and long-term.
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:54.860]   And if you're wondering what those are,
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.780]   I listed them out at the beginning of the episode
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:59.140]   and their justification for being on that list.
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:03.980]   What this means is obviously you want to consume foods
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:07.700]   that you like, but because brain health is very important
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:10.580]   and many of the foods that promote brain health
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:13.980]   perhaps are not the most palatable to you
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:16.060]   or desirable to you,
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:19.340]   the key would be to ingest the foods
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.380]   that you want to ingest more of
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:23.320]   simply because they're good for you
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.180]   and not because they taste good to you
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:29.980]   alongside foods that increase whatever fuel system
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.380]   you happen to be relying on.
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:34.300]   I think that's the most nutritionally politically correct
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.140]   way to say it.
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:37.640]   So if you're keto, that would mean ketones, okay?
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.220]   If you're not ketogenic,
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:41.560]   and I think most people probably are not in ketosis
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.340]   or trying to maintain ketosis,
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.220]   but for instance, people that are on a purely
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.100]   plant-based diet, that would be one set of foods.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.420]   For people that are omnivores, a different set of foods.
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.800]   And for people that are carnivores,
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.080]   yet another set of foods.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.060]   If you want to eat more of a particular food
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:55.980]   because it's good for you,
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.500]   pair it with something in the same meal.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:02.360]   You don't have to hide it physically or in the flavor sense.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.220]   You don't have to hide it within that other food,
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:06.300]   but pair it with that other food
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:09.860]   that provides you a shift in brain metabolism,
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:13.040]   because that's really what your brain and you are seeking
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.800]   even though you don't realize it.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.180]   How long will this take?
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:19.940]   Well, according to the data in humans on sucralose
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:23.920]   and the conditioning for sucralose to have these effects,
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.740]   which in many cases were detrimental, right?
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:28.380]   Because they were increasing insulin.
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:29.460]   But in this case,
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:33.620]   you're trying to hijack this conditioning of food preference
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.820]   for healthy purposes, not with sucralose,
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.160]   but by ingesting things that are good for you.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.940]   Then the data really points to the fact
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:44.900]   that even within a short period of time of about seven days,
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:47.080]   but certainly within 14 days,
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.620]   that food will take on a subjective experience
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:54.900]   of tasting at least better to you, if not good to you.
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.440]   Now, I believe this has important implications
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.600]   for much of the controversy and food wars
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.040]   that we see out there.
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.180]   Food wars being, of course,
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:08.960]   these groups that ardently subscribe to the idea
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:12.280]   that their diet and the things that they are eating
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.900]   are the foods that are good for us
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.580]   and that are the most pleasureful
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.500]   and the things that everyone should be eating.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:23.120]   We see this with every community within the nutrition realm.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.960]   Now, of course, there are studies that point to the fact
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.940]   that certain foods and food components are healthier
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:31.080]   probably for us and for the planet,
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.940]   but you really see it on both ends of the spectrum.
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.900]   You've got people who are on a pure carnivore diet
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:37.700]   who are arguing with a lot of biomedical evidence
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:40.380]   that that's what's best for us and beneficial.
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:41.220]   And then you've got people
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:44.060]   that are arguing the same general sets of arguments,
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.600]   but for a purely plant-based diet.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.780]   And then I think most people fall
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:48.340]   into the omnivore category.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:51.880]   What's very clear, however,
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.460]   is that what we consume on a regular basis
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:59.600]   and what leads to increases in brain metabolism
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.640]   leads to increases in dopamine
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.400]   and thereby our motivation to eat them.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:08.560]   So what this really says is that what we tend to do regularly
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.240]   becomes reinforcing in and of itself.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.140]   And I think in large part can explain the fact that,
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:15.960]   yes, indeed, for certain people,
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:18.660]   a given diet not only feels good,
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.380]   but they heavily subscribe to the nutrient
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.700]   and kind of health beneficial effects of that diet.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:27.240]   And they often will provide evidence for that,
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.660]   whether or not you ask them for it or not.
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:32.020]   But that's true of every subcategory
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.420]   within the nutrition realm.
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.740]   Again, this is not to take away
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:39.260]   from some of the beautiful data emphasizing
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.500]   that certain foods and micronutrients, et cetera,
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.540]   are better for us or worse for us and for the planet.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:47.380]   That's not a debate I want to get into right now.
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.380]   What this emphasizes is that foods impact our brain
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.140]   and its health, but they also impact
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:59.700]   how our brain functions and responds to food.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.580]   And that is largely a learned response.
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:05.460]   We can't completely override, for instance,
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:09.460]   that certain foods evoke a strong yuck component.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.660]   Certain foods are truly putrid to us.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.540]   I should just say certain things are putrid to us
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:15.280]   and we should not consume them, right?
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.860]   And that's at the far end of the spectrum,
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.860]   it's hardwired for us to avoid those
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:21.940]   because they can be dangerous for us.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:24.120]   They can make us very, very sick.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:27.700]   But it's also true that if we continue to eat foods
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:29.500]   that are progressively sweeter and sweeter
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.740]   and highly palatable, it shifts our dopamine system
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.940]   because it activates our dopamine system
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.620]   to make us believe that those foods are the only foods
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.920]   that can trigger this reward system
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.140]   and make us feel good and that they taste good.
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:46.020]   But after consuming foods that perhaps are less sweet
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:49.860]   or even less savory that are not what we would call highly,
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:52.280]   or I would say nowadays it's super palatable foods,
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:57.280]   we can adjust our sense literally of what we perceive
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.780]   as an attractive and rewarding food.
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.600]   And indeed the dopamine system
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.260]   will reward those foods accordingly.
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:07.420]   I can't emphasize enough how much this learning
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.960]   of associated food reward is important
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.540]   for not just understanding why we like the foods that we eat
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:17.380]   and how to eat more of foods that are healthy for us
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:21.660]   and enjoy them, but it also speaks to the fact
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:25.500]   that our brain as a whole is a perceptual device
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.720]   trying to make guesses or estimations
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.420]   about what certain foods are going to do for us.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.180]   So put simply, we don't just like sweet foods
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.020]   because they taste good.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.280]   We like them because they predict
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.180]   a certain kind of metabolic response.
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:41.960]   This is important also because Dana Small
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:45.520]   and Ivan de Araujo and others have been exploring
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.440]   whether or not people, for instance,
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.380]   that have type 2 diabetes or that suffer
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:52.320]   from any number of different metabolic disorders,
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.800]   whether or not somehow these food reward systems
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.600]   are permanently disrupted.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.480]   And through a beautiful set of experiments
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.580]   that have been done mainly by Dana Small's group at Yale,
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.760]   but also by the de Araujo group and others,
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.260]   exploring how the reward pathways are altered
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.760]   in various metabolic disorders, et cetera,
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:16.060]   people suffering from type 2 diabetes.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:18.020]   We don't have time to go into all those data now,
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:21.260]   but the takeaway is that food preference
[01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:23.740]   and the ability to reshape these circuits
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:26.100]   is not disrupted in these people
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.200]   to the point where it can't be rewired.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.660]   And that's very encouraging because what it means is that
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.300]   for people that are suffering from these syndromes
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:36.780]   through some simple alterations in dietary choice,
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:39.860]   provided those are carried out over time
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:43.060]   and in the correct way by pairing with the foods
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:46.440]   that will appropriately shift metabolism of the brain,
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.740]   one can actually rewire what they consider
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.460]   not just palatable, but attractive as foods.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:55.560]   If you want to learn more about food reward
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.780]   and food reinforcement,
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.100]   'cause it turns out those are slightly different things,
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.940]   there's a wonderful review written by Ivan de Araujo.
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.020]   They have a middle author, Mark Shachter and Dana Small.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.840]   It's called "Rethinking Food Reward,"
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.780]   and it was published in the Annual Reviews of Psychology.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.220]   You can find it very easily online.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.020]   It was published in 2019.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.240]   And it's a beautiful deep dive,
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.460]   although quite accessible to most people,
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:22.540]   about how different foods and the way that we perceive them
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.000]   impacts our brain and body
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.760]   and why we like the things we like
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.020]   and how to reshape what we like.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:31.100]   So once again, we've done a fairly extensive deep dive
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.660]   into food and your brain,
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:36.780]   focusing first on how particular foods
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:39.580]   and compounds within foods that are available
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.240]   also through supplementation
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.120]   can impact immediate and long-term brain health.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.760]   Came up with a relatively short list
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.760]   of what I would call super foods,
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:52.880]   only because there are ample data to support their role
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.260]   in enhancing short and long-term cognition
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.280]   and neuronal health and so on.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.280]   And we also talked about food preference
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.300]   and why particular tastes
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:04.260]   and particular events within the gut
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.420]   and particular events within the brain
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:10.900]   combine to lead us to pursue particular foods
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.660]   and to avoid other foods
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:15.340]   and how you can leverage those pathways
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.140]   in order to pursue more of the foods
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:18.660]   that are going to be good for you
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.380]   and good not just for your brain,
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.140]   but for your overall body health
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:23.980]   and to enjoy them along the way.

[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:16.940]   During today's podcast and on many other previous episodes,
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.800]   we talked about various supplements.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.980]   One of the major issues with supplements
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:22.500]   is that supplement companies
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.760]   don't always have the highest quality standards
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.260]   and/or the amounts of the supplements
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.380]   that they list on the bottle
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.140]   aren't what actually are contained
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:33.060]   in the capsules and pills and powders of those supplements.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.860]   For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:38.880]   because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.000]   with respect to the quality of the supplements they use
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.360]   and the quantity of the supplements they use.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.160]   They've partnered with all the major sports teams
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.200]   and with the Mayo Clinic,
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:48.620]   and we have tremendous confidence
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.940]   in the quality of their supplements.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:52.140]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:57.140]   you can go to thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:00.820]   There, you can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:03.300]   And if you navigate into the main site
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:06.420]   through that portal of thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.820]   you can also get 20% off
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:10.100]   any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:12.420]   And last but not least,
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:14.180]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.760]   [upbeat music]
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.340]   (upbeat music)
