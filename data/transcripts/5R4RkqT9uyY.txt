[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   Who is God?
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.560]   I can think of no more foundational question
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.200]   in all of the world.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.200]   So who is this God, this one behind all of creation?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.440]   Who is this one who made you and who made me?
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.960]   Who is this one who speaks to us through an ancient book,
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   a book that is as alive as it is old?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.800]   This is a beautiful topic covered by Pastor John's
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.600]   recent sermon he delivered in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.280]   He opened that message with 10 brief answers
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   to the all important question, who is God?
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   Have a listen.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   - Why did God identify himself as I am who I am?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.540]   I absolutely am.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.800]   Now if we can take off our clouded spectacles
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.040]   of mere religious jargon like G-O-D,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.040]   this should come, will come as a bolt of lightning.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.880]   God is.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.380]   That's staggering.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.600]   What sentence could be more important
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   in any language than God is?
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.440]   So what did he mean when he said I absolutely am?
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.280]   I am who I am.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.760]   What did he mean?
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.480]   Now I'm gonna linger here longer than you think I should,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.480]   perhaps, because until God becomes dominant
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.200]   in our thinking and in our feeling,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.520]   until God becomes the blazing sun
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   at the center of the solar system of our daily lives,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.720]   until God becomes the Mount Everest
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.040]   in the foothills of all of our concerns with this world,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   until God rests on the souls of the saints in Belfast
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.360]   and on the churches of Northern Ireland,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   until he rests on the churches and the people here
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.660]   with 10,000 times more weight
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.720]   than all your political concerns
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.640]   and all your church growth concerns,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.340]   then all of our talk about the glory of God
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.640]   and singing and gathering for worship
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.400]   will be just more tinkering and engineering of religion
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.080]   to try to get people to do what we hope they will do
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.760]   in some kind of appropriate way.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   The world doesn't need any more tinkering with religion.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.080]   It needs God.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.440]   It needs to see God.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.880]   It needs to be stunned that there is a God.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.320]   So it's no accident that when Moses says,
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.360]   who's sending me?
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.960]   God says, I am who I am, period.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.640]   And we need to linger over that.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.400]   And I've got 10 things I think it means.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.600]   They're very short.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.000]   It's not the whole message, it's introduction.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Number one, God is who he is means he never had a beginning.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.640]   And that just staggers the mind.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.760]   Every child asks his parents, where did God come from?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.600]   Who made God?
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.640]   And every wise parent says, nobody made God.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.880]   He just was always there.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   Always.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   No beginning.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.680]   Number two, God is who he is means God will never end.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.960]   If he didn't come into being, he can't go out of being
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.480]   because he is being.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.220]   Absolute being.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.400]   There's no place to go outside being.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.720]   There's only he.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   Before he creates, he's all there is, absolutely.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.440]   Number three, God is who he is means God is absolute reality.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.600]   There's no reality before him,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.520]   there's no reality outside of him
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.000]   unless he wills it and creates it.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He's not one of many realities before he creates.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.640]   He is simply absolute reality.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.260]   He's all that was, eternally.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.220]   No space, space didn't exist.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.360]   The universe didn't exist.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.320]   Emptiness did not exist.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.720]   Only God existed forever.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.760]   Absolutely and absolutely all.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.560]   Number four, God is who he is means
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.140]   that God is utterly independent.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.120]   He depends on nothing to bring him into being.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.440]   He depends on nothing to support him.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.560]   He depends on nothing to counsel him.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.080]   He depends on nothing to make him what he is.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.320]   He is absolutely independent.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.920]   Number five, God is who he is means everything
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   that is not God depends totally on God.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.880]   All that is not God is secondary, dependent.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.120]   The entire universe is secondary reality.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.600]   Let that sink in because nobody in this city believes that.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.120]   And if the church doesn't, you're just like them.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.840]   All the universe is secondary.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.640]   Humanity is secondary.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   God is primary, absolute, first, last, glorious.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.240]   Everything else, secondary.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.720]   Galaxies compared to God, nothing.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.560]   That's number six.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.640]   Let me just go back and restate it.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.160]   God is who he is means all the universe
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.220]   is by comparison to God as nothing.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.220]   All the universe by comparison to God is as nothing.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.220]   Contingent, dependent reality is to absolute,
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.500]   independent reality as a shadow to substance,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   as echo to thunderclap, as bubble to ocean.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.180]   All that we see, all that you are amazed by
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.420]   in your land or around the world,
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.900]   all the world, all the galaxies is compared to God
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.420]   as nothing.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.020]   If you put God on one side of the scales
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.700]   and the universe on the other side of the scales,
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.700]   the universe goes up like air or dust on the scale.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.520]   Isaiah 40, 17, all the nations are as nothing before him.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.100]   They are accounted by him as less than nothing
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.720]   and emptiness.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   Number seven, God is who he is means God is constant.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.960]   He's the same yesterday, today, forever.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.520]   He cannot be improved.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.760]   He cannot be diminished.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.600]   He's not becoming anything.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.380]   He is who he is.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.720]   There's no development in God.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.360]   There's no progress in God.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.020]   Absolute perfection cannot be improved.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.800]   Number eight, God is who he is means he is
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   the absolute standard of truth and goodness and beauty.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.280]   There's no law book which he consults
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.520]   in deciding what is right.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.060]   There's no almanac to establish facts for God.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.540]   There's no guild, no musical guild, for example,
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.840]   to determine what is excellent and beautiful.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.120]   He's the standard.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.400]   He himself is the standard of the right,
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.960]   the true, the beautiful.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   Number nine, God is who he is means God does
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.040]   whatever he pleases and it is always right,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.140]   always beautiful, always in accord with truth.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.500]   There are no constraints on God from outside
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.100]   that he doesn't will to exist and thus govern.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.520]   All reality that is outside of him is subordinate to him.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.800]   So he's utterly free.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.120]   He's the only free being in the universe, in fact.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.380]   He is utterly free from any constraints
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.360]   that don't originate from his own will.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.920]   Finally, number 10, God is who he is means
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.880]   he's the greatest, the most beautiful,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   the most valuable, and the most important person in existence.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.280]   He's more worthy of interest and attention
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   and admiration and enjoyment than all persons
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.480]   and all realities put together,
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.320]   including the entire universe.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.280]   Now, the Bible reveals and assumes that God everywhere.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.800]   - Amen, that's so good.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.440]   There's a lot more to God, but there's nothing less
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.640]   about God than these 10 incredible realities.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.560]   This excerpt is from Pastor John's sermon
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.240]   in Belfast, Northern Ireland that he preached there in July.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.020]   The message is titled "The Glory of God and Why We Sing."
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.280]   Video and audio of the message is available online
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.200]   right now at desiringgod.org.

[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.600]   Friday, we're gonna close the week with a doozy.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.040]   Is there a place in the church for female pastors?
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   Female pastors, some say yes, others say no.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.840]   Pastor John will weigh in on the factors
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.880]   that we need to understand in this growing debate,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.160]   a debate growing within complementarian circles,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.960]   not outside of complementarian circles.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.880]   This is a very interesting factor in all of this.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.120]   That's up on Friday.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
