[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.840]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets, and I'm your host.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680]   Today is Monday, December 22, 2014.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.560]   And today I have a great interview show for you with Ben Falk from Vermont.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.680]   Ben is a really great guy. He runs a planning firm called Whole Systems Design.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.040]   And he is involved in fairly comprehensive, I would call him a permaculture designer,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.800]   but if you're scared off by that word, just call him basically a comprehensive designer,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.880]   where he brings a comprehensive perspective about designing the needs for human habitat
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.680]   into our current context.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.920]   Ben has written a book on the subject, and it's one of the most beautiful, well-integrated books that I've ever read.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.840]   I've looked for people to bring on the show who are living more independent, self-sufficient lifestyles,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.840]   and Ben is one of those people that I think is a really great example of how to do this in a modern context
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.120]   and to integrate all of the great things about the current, highly technological world that we live in,
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:39.840]   but also to benefit from some of the old world technology and benefits that we simply don't probably respect very much today.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.200]   It's a really great show. We go over a comprehensive perspective on designing for heat, for housing, for food,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.520]   and also a little bit of more, I guess, intellectual theory, a little bit of theory behind design.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   And we also talk about Ben's story.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.240]   So I hope you enjoy this interview. I'm going to skip coming back at the end with any closing notes,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.240]   so the interview will simply end.

[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.520]   So Ben, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.760]   Thanks a lot. It's great to be here.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.920]   I've brought you on to talk about design and design from a more integrated holistic perspective.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.840]   And as a beginning point, I think the name of your company is a perfect place to start.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.560]   Your company is called Whole Systems Design.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   So let's kick off with that.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.960]   What does Whole Systems Design mean and what do you do as a firm?
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.040]   Sure. Well, to me, Whole Systems Design is, well, just the term Whole Systems is,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.240]   denotes the idea that we're thinking about and hopefully, that we're thinking about
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:33.280]   the whole that we're working with, that we're thinking about all parts of a set of features
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.200]   and processes, a set of conditions that are interrelated, right?
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.320]   So that's a system. And since we're saying Whole Systems Design, design denotes an idea of
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.120]   intending something and responding to something, a challenge, a solution to a challenge in very
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.960]   simple terms. So Whole Systems Design is just the name that I put to this idea when I was in
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.000]   college. I was working as a carpenter and a builder and saw firsthand a lot of, and had before that,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.080]   really for my whole life, but especially more acutely when I was building houses in college,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:18.400]   many responses, many design responses that were lacking, very severely lacking because
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   specialists were involved throughout the process and everyone was looking at their little piece of
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.800]   the elephant. And as the adage goes, no one really realized they were looking at an elephant.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.080]   They were just looking at one part of this huge beast and doing the one part to their best
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.560]   ability. And sometimes even that one part really well, whether it's the architect or the guy pouring
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.200]   the foundation or the people putting up the timber frame, which was the part of it that I often
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:55.680]   worked on. But the whole, the result of the whole process and the net result was, at best, usually
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:05.120]   very, very weak and incompetent and inadequate to solve the challenges of the site or of the people
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.480]   living in the home or usually both. What's interesting to me is that you came at it
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.600]   from the perspective, it sounds like, of construction and architecture. And I came
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   at it from the perspective of financial planning, because I noticed the same thing in financial
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.520]   planning, where oftentimes in the field of financial planning, there are many specialists
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.400]   and people are thinking that they're looking for a specialized answer. And there is a need
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.960]   for specialists who are experts, who have a deep level of expertise in an area. But what happens
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.800]   if you only go to a specialist, you only get that specialist's answer. It seems to me, it's more
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.840]   likely that if you go to a surgeon, that the surgeon is going to recommend surgery than that
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.080]   somebody who might be a natural, I don't know what the term is, but a naturopathic physician.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.040]   And so it's not that there's, if you have a need for surgery, you need a surgeon who has an in-depth
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.640]   level of knowledge. But in our society, we seem to have lost much of the ability to integrate
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.600]   different aspects of design and to essentially meeting our needs and to bring them together
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   in a holistic way. Yeah, just to tag onto that, I think that's absolutely right on. I think it
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.760]   really emerges more often than not from failing to be able to ask the right questions and ask
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.160]   the, you know, come at it from a broad picture. Like you said, if you're a surgeon,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.800]   you know, your answer to it is how do we do surgery? Or if you're, you know, you're someone who,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.240]   you know, subscribes, you know, supplements, that's the answers within what supplements are
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.280]   best. But we tend to fail to ask, to kind of back up and ask the most broad, kind of most
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.760]   holistic questions about why, you know, why is the problem what it is to begin with? And that's
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.720]   exactly, I think, where we'll, where we find the most effective answers, which is usually
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.080]   requires many specialists to come up with that, that holistic answer, not just one.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:13.920]   So share with me your career path. You start noticing these things at working as a builder.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.200]   How did you get from where you were then to where you are now working as a designer
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.000]   of human habitats? Sure. Well, I think first for me, it's rooted in, you know, I don't know,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.400]   at some point growing up, maybe middle school or high school, I started to be able to,
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   to recognize it, just a recognition that there's just so much failure in the world around us.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.880]   There's so much inadequate and just poor response to a problem that, that, you know, around me,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.480]   but I grew up in the suburbs and I just, just see this everywhere, whether it was just,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:54.720]   you know, in roads or, or buildings certainly, or, or organizations. And so that was kind of
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:03.200]   the formative experience was kind of witnessing, you know, failed responses to challenges. And then,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.680]   yeah, I got to college and I think for me, what was probably the first real series of events was
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.680]   meeting Dr. John Todd, who's a father of modern day ecological design is that keep credit as the
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.280]   inventor of the living machine, you know, biological way to treat wastewater, just,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:28.880]   you know, a forerunner in imitating how nature works really, you know, an early, early pioneering,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.440]   you know, by a near and really defining that field. So I was lucky he was teaching at the
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.400]   university of Vermont where I was in school. And I was actually thinking about quitting and going
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.040]   to be a rock climbing bum. I did for a little while, cause that's what I liked to do a lot
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.320]   more than, you know, what I've studied in college. It wasn't very compelling for me.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:54.560]   And then I took his course and I realized that there was actually a hands-on creative response
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.960]   to problems that could be very direct and we could do ourselves. And we didn't, if we wanted to solve
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.720]   big problems or even small problems, we didn't have to, you know, petition someone to do it.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.240]   We didn't have to get a politician to do something for us necessarily. We could actually kind of take
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:21.280]   on a problem directly and really change the rules of the game and address a problem through,
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.160]   you know, thinking, thinking through a problem, designing a solution, and then making that
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.080]   solution, actually building it with our own hands like he did with the living machine.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.800]   So that I think kicked me off and more formally in the direction that I've been on ever since,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:44.000]   which is just to, if I see something wrong, you know, make a different way as Buckminster Fuller
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.200]   is often quoted, you know, don't, something to the effect, I'm sure I'll butcher it right now,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   but you know, there's no resisting, you know, fighting something that's wrong. You make a
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.600]   different system that makes the old system that you don't like obsolete, you know, don't just try
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:07.520]   to put up walls and resist something you don't like, but make something else instead. And so I
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:17.280]   think that's what, I guess what my whole life has been becoming for the last 15 to 20 years. And
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:28.240]   my work is just an organic outgrowth of that lifestyle. And we now work for people who want to
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.640]   kind of, I guess, undertake those same, that same approach to some extent or similar approaches
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.880]   themselves in their own life. And they're often coming from very different backgrounds than
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:47.520]   I came from, for sure. So how do you label yourself? So do you call yourself a designer,
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.600]   a permaculture designer, a human habitat system designer? Do you have a label that you apply to
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:11:00.160]   yourself? Yeah. I, you know, I have called myself, you know, a land designer or, you know, human
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.200]   habitat system designer. That's a little bit of a mouthful, so I don't really use that. But that is
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.840]   really what we're getting at is a whole, you know, the idea of my business and of, I think,
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.320]   my lifestyle is whole human habitats. You know, we're looking at all, you know, we're not going
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.000]   to shy away from anything that's involved with keeping us alive here and having a good life.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.320]   So anything that's in that purview, let's think about those systems, those needs, and let's try
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:38.480]   to meet needs in a hopefully very non-detrimental way and as much as possible in a regenerative and
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.080]   enhancing way. So, you know, yeah, it's a bit beyond obviously what most architects or what
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.680]   any architect tends to do or what a just a landscape architect tends to do or I don't know,
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.640]   there's no, there's really no good term, but I think more and more what we're doing and I think
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:02.000]   what a lot of us are doing in the permaculture space is just, it's really about lifestyle
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.320]   redesign. I mean, I think I keep coming to the word lifestyle more and more in the last handful
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.440]   of years when I think about my own work, when I sit down with clients and I sometimes have a kind
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:21.600]   of clarifying moment of how we're really helping people we work with, I realize it's often, it's
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:29.040]   most often a lifestyle thing. It's rooted in people adjusting their lifestyles and it's also
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.560]   all about empowerment. So I think more and more, I don't have a good label, but it's about,
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:42.640]   it's a, you know, a personal empowerment consultant to fix problems in your own life and
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.600]   hopefully in the landscape and the living world around you. You know, that's kind of a long,
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.360]   a long, I don't know if they all have capitals at the beginning or what, but
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:59.280]   that's, that's, that's kind of what it's about for us. I'm glad you put the label lifestyle design
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.960]   onto that. That label has been popularized among the, some of the online world of young men and
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:11.840]   women working to essentially create a business to, to fund their lifestyle with the idea that if I
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.880]   can create some sort of virtual or online business that requires a minimum effort from me, that,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.840]   that will set me free. And I think that's certainly a great, a viable aspect, but the problem is that's
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.560]   only a financial solution. I don't view that as an integrated solution. It only maybe solves one
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.920]   aspect of life, which is a financial aspect of life. And the only point of the financial aspect
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:41.520]   of life is to fund, you know, the, the needs that we have on a daily basis. And so I think that by
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.080]   approaching the problem at every level, maybe we can find better solutions. I'd love for you to
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.440]   kick off and share with me how, if I came to you as a consulting client and I were going to say,
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.160]   Ben, listen, you know, my family, I'm trying to create a better lifestyle for myself and my
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.320]   family. How would you think through that from a design perspective? Where would you start?
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.440]   What components would you consider and how would you guide me through that process?
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:21.280]   Yeah, I think I would start the same way someone, you know, is the same way someone who would want
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.400]   to design or be able to help you design an off-grid house would start. And this is how
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.880]   Amory Lovins always talks about, you know, energy challenges is what are the needs? You know, what
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.360]   are the loads in the system? Like when we think about making a house independent of the power
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.280]   grid, for instance, you start by thinking, well, not how am I going to make all the power I need?
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.920]   You start by thinking, how am I going to have, how am I going to get by on as little power as
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:52.160]   possible because it's expensive and contains a lot of compromises to make power. So what are my
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.440]   loads? You know, what do I need to run in the home, whether it's a freezer or a refrigerator
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:03.120]   or different lights? And then how do I get around? How do I need as few of those as possible? Or how
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.480]   do I reduce the amount of electricity that each of those things uses? So in the same way, analogous
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.920]   to that, I would want to understand what's that person need? What do they think they need? Of
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.840]   course, the answer you'll get is what they think they need usually in the beginning of the
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:25.120]   conversation. And then we facilitate a conversation where we try to get at, okay, what are the core
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.440]   needs truly that you have to be happy? And often, well, always, if someone says, you know,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:42.880]   I need a car and I need $50,000 of income a year and a 33,000 square foot house or whatever it may
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.880]   be, whatever the physical needs are, as you start drilling down to, bro, really what really keeps
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:55.360]   you satisfied and what really makes you psyched about life? It has nothing to do with those
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:01.200]   physical things. And so we start moving into a space where we can think about, okay, what is the
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:11.600]   minimum of the physical needs to support those more, call it spiritual needs or whatever we
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.920]   want to call it. And so we start drilling down on that and thinking about with people how they can
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:25.520]   reduce their quote unquote load. Because once you reduce your load, the less economic inputs you
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:32.880]   need to live, the more freedom you have off the bat to actually design your landscape building
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:40.160]   system and really your lifestyle as a whole. I mean, there's really no one who has more leverage
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:48.080]   over their lifestyle than that person who's kind of simplified things down as much as possible.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:56.960]   So that's a great starting point. People are willing to work in that practice to very different
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:04.480]   degrees. I'm kind of hardcore compared to a mainstream American suburbanite, but I'm actually
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   not hardcore at all as far as my own physical needs in my life compared to some people I know
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:18.560]   who live with far less physical resources. So it varies. Where people are willing to attack that
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.960]   problem varies greatly. And then we look at, okay, how do you supply for the load? So if you defined
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:31.520]   I need 2000 kilowatts a month or whatever, 10,000 kilowatts a year, whatever it might be,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.920]   how do I come up with those kilowatts? In this context, it'd be how do I come with that money?
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.680]   And that also always revolves around a conversation about what do you love to do? What do you love to
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.600]   do and what are you great at doing? Because I think those two things are central. If you're
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.880]   not doing something that you're not really good at, particularly talented at, you're probably not
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.960]   going to like it that much and vice versa. If you don't like it that much, you're probably not going
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:13.280]   to be that good at it. And I see so many people doing something that doesn't even meet either of
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.120]   those criteria. And I think it seems to me that people, anyone that thrives is usually meeting
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:29.280]   both of those criteria, at least most of most days, not all the time for sure, but most of the time.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   Would you describe your personal lifestyle and how you have built intelligent design into your
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:49.360]   personal lifestyle? I'd love to. I think it's emerged quite organically. Just to contextualize
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:55.920]   things, I'm standing outside my wood shop right now and I'm watching the snowfall really hard.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:04.240]   And I'm looking out at a landscape that basically every tree I see we've put in the ground at some
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.680]   point in the last 10 years. And most of those have started to give us food and looking at a
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.240]   greenhouse that I just picked kale out of for a salad a couple hours ago. And kind of looking
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:22.560]   around at a system that I haven't created, but I've helped create very heavily, co-created is
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:32.240]   probably a better term. And I think there's a lot of simple ways I could say that happened. I did
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.800]   this and this and that, and I did this and then the other thing. I put one step in front of the
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:42.080]   other and did this very logical progression. But really, I think, to be most honest, I would have
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:49.280]   to start by saying where my life is now, and I'm very thankful for where it is now, if they think
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.360]   it's working out very well for me, I wouldn't really want it any other way. It is that way
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:01.840]   because I think I've just followed what I love to do. I've also had a lot of, you know, a good
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:07.760]   community of family and friends, and I've relied on that community. But really, I've just done what
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:14.960]   I love to do, and I've used the resources, whatever they are around me, to do what I love to do
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   every day. And I think in somewhat of an uncompromising way, I mean, I hated school the
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:27.680]   first 12 years of my life. I absolutely hated more than most anyone else who was sitting in those
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:34.400]   rooms with me. So I had to be very, I had to actually really rebel from the structure that I
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:42.720]   was in because it wasn't what I wanted to do, and it wasn't what I could be good at either
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:49.760]   necessarily. So I think another piece of that, I know this is a little bit imprecise what I'm
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:55.360]   saying, but another piece of that is I guess I'm thankful for a pretty significant lack of
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.400]   self-discipline in the way, if self-discipline is doing something you don't want to do day after
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   day and kind of undertaking the grudgery that seems all too common in the world, I just somehow
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:19.040]   very instinctually just wasn't okay with trading my days away, sitting inside doing something I
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.400]   didn't want to do. I had a very, very low tolerance for that. And I think I'm glad I did because if
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:32.640]   I didn't, I wouldn't be here right now, and I can't imagine being in a better place. Maybe I
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:40.800]   would be, but I certainly am very happy for where I am right now in life and the opportunities I'm
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.000]   afforded. And I think a lot of that has to do with staying very focused on what it is that one
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.320]   loves. For me, that was being outdoors. I didn't know anything more than that until I got to
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.480]   college. I just knew I wanted to be outside. I mean, the sun would come out on like a November
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.880]   day in Rochester, New York, where I grew up, and I would just pick up my bag and walk out of class.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.320]   And it was obvious I wasn't going to the bathroom because I was taking my backpack with me, and the
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:12.880]   class had started 10 minutes earlier. And I knew the sun was coming out for two hours, and that's
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:20.400]   it, maybe the whole week in November. And I wasn't going to spend those two hours indoors and not be
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.840]   kind of part of what was happening on the earth at that time, in the outdoor world. That's where I
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:35.600]   felt alive and still do. So I think all of this whole permaculture regeneration thing is all just
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:43.200]   chasing that same line of kind of instinctual reasoning down. For me personally, now there's a
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.440]   lot of other more precise steps that I've taken, but I think that's at the core of it.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.440]   For my own story anyway. Yeah. So I have the advantage of having read your book, which by the
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.000]   way, of all the books I've read, your book is called The Resilient Farm and Homestead,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.480]   might be the most beautiful book on the subject that I've ever seen. It's absolutely gorgeous.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.320]   I'm sure you put a lot of work into that. Thanks a lot. That's great to hear. It was a bit of work
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:16.480]   for sure. And also just your designs. And I don't know if you're the one actually producing them,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.280]   or if you have an artist working with you, but your designs are just stunningly beautiful.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:28.240]   Thanks. Yeah. Cornelius Murphy, who's my main colleague in the business, whole system design,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.400]   is the illustrator for that book. And I give him all my rough chicken scratch and he makes it
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:39.840]   look really compelling. It really makes a big difference. So having read your book and being
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.480]   familiar a little bit with your work, where I'm trying to lead you is actually to discuss some of
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:51.280]   the practical details of how you have integrated designing for your own needs into your lifestyle.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:56.640]   So my perspective, and I'd like you to give some specifics and walk people through essentially how
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:03.520]   it works, but you've designed for your food needs, your nutrition needs, your shelter needs,
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:11.120]   you've brought all of the physical human needs together. Because often what I get as a financial
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.760]   planner is people just say, "I need X amount of dollars per month." And that's a useful goal.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.800]   But sometimes you need to look at, "What do I need the X number of dollars per month to do?"
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.360]   So I'd like you to describe how you think about your lifestyle and how you've designed it to meet
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.000]   your fuel needs, your housing needs, all of these things together in an intelligent way.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.080]   Sure. Well, I think that's also emerged organically, but it's definitely come from
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:46.480]   a focus first and foremost on the hierarchy of needs, putting the most basic needs before
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.360]   needs that aren't as basic. So for instance, I still don't have a solar photovoltaic system.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:59.200]   Most of the time you want to have a "sustainable" lifestyle in this culture. And the first thing
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:05.120]   you do is put up solar panels. Well, solar panels will still be the last thing I end up doing. I
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.920]   plan to actually put up some more photovoltaics. But the electricity is not as basic of a need as
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.280]   food. So what we've started with is our food and water systems and our shelter systems. Because if
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:24.320]   the order of operations is staying warm, not freezing to death, and where I live in Vermont,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:31.520]   that's basic. You're not going to freeze to death in Southern California, but you are in a good
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.480]   chunk of the world. So you got to have a shelter that keeps you warm with a minimal amount of
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:42.320]   input going into it. For us in a forested region of the world like New England, you can't beat
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.040]   wood heat. And if you really insulate your house well, and you detail it pretty well, and you have
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:54.240]   a good amount of mass, you can actually cut your fuel wood need, no matter what fuel you're using,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:00.640]   drastically right off the bat. So we started with that. We started with getting our buildings in
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.480]   order, getting everything wood powered. The first thing I did when I bought the house here, which
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.200]   existed and isn't a very well insulated house, we actually built this kind of secondary space
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.320]   near it. So it could be very high performance, because there's only so much renovation you can do
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.800]   necessarily, unless money's no object. And the first thing I did was put a wood stove in it,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.520]   and started collecting firewood and meeting my own basic heating needs. I mean, I think the house
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:34.240]   that I moved into went from probably the woman who lived in it before me spent $2,500 a year to $3,000
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.840]   on heat and hot water. And immediately we were spending less than $1,000. So that was slashed.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:47.760]   And now we spend less than $400 or $500 on that house. And our other living space, it's really
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.880]   essentially free. I mean, it's the cost of chainsaw gas, which might be $10 to $15 to harvest and
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:01.920]   process the firewood we use to heat 1,500 square feet. And that gives us all our heat and hot water.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:07.280]   So heating was central. Food, water is central. We're fortunate to have pretty good access to
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.000]   water in this part of the world, but we started collecting rainwater and also managing water in
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.560]   the landscape better, which there's a lot to it. But it's a pretty basic approach. I outline it in
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.840]   my book, and a lot of people in the permaculture space are all about that already. And then we
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.640]   started getting on top of our food system. So basically started ripping up my lawn within the
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:35.200]   first couple of years of being here. And now we grow most of our own calories for most of the year.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:44.960]   And we might spend, I don't know what we spent on food beforehand, but we've cut it by 80% to 90%.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   Now when we go to the co-op, the food store nearby, every now and then we get some chocolate
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.480]   or coffee, although we've really given up coffee for the most part. We get some spices here and
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:04.960]   there. Sometimes we'll buy some apples if we don't have any. But we're not buying much of our staples
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:12.080]   anymore, or really almost any vegetables. So we've gotten those aspects in order, shelter,
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:18.480]   heat, water, food. And now in the last few years, we're really working on the health,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.680]   on the other health aspects, like the medicinal aspects in particular, growing more herbs,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.240]   expanding our herbal medicine, kind of the home apothecary, and really expanding
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.640]   the opportunities for that in the landscape, both through learning plants and fungi better,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.840]   so we can just go wildcraft them in the woods for free. And also actually dedicating garden space
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:49.760]   and time to growing a lot of just baseline herbs in the garden, which help keep us healthy as human
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:56.080]   beings, have relied on these plants for thousands of years to do the same. And we're starting to
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:02.880]   just re-recognize those basic needs in the modern era now. So we're working on that a lot more in
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:10.960]   the last few years. My wife is a naturopathic doctor and clinical herbalist, and she's made
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:19.440]   a living doing holistic health work for about almost 20 years. And so she's been a big resource
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:26.880]   on that front to expand the homestead and farm in that direction. Yeah, so those are some of the
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:34.480]   basic needs. We've gotten our heads around and our hands around. And all of that, just like you said,
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:41.760]   I mean, that opens up the door to more freedom for us. It takes a lot of time, and people always say
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.520]   that. They're like, "Well, but doesn't that take a lot of time? Couldn't you just be going
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.440]   and making money instead of being in the garden, then you could go buy the food?"
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:55.680]   Absolutely. I mean, I could go make enough money in the time I spent in the garden, I can make
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.880]   enough money to buy way more, way greater quantity of food than I grow in the garden.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:07.440]   But A, it's not the same quality of food. It's incomparable. The food you harvest in your front
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:14.640]   yard, you just can't buy food that good. And B, it's what would you rather spend your time doing?
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:21.280]   And for me, being in the garden, harvesting fruit around in the yard, or going looking for mushrooms
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:30.000]   up in the woods, that's really what I'm alive to do. I'm not doing it to save money. It does
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.800]   save a lot of money, but that's not my main motivation. I'm just doing something that I love
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:43.840]   to do. So I often tell people, "Don't do this out of feeling like it's a chore, or you're trying to
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.120]   get to some destination by doing this. Do it if you like to do it. If you don't like being in the
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:56.960]   garden with your hands in the dirt, then don't grow food." In some ways, it's very, very simple.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.600]   It probably always hasn't been that simple, because sometimes you have to grow food just
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:08.080]   to survive in certain contexts, in certain places in the world still. But luckily for me,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:15.120]   I actually like meeting my basic needs. It's just something that's very, very satisfying.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   One of the things that most appeals to me about intelligent design is the ability to A,
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:27.680]   think ahead, and B, stack functions together so that many things can be met with the same
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:36.640]   resources, to try to use resources in the most efficient manner. I actually love to do this on
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:44.080]   the financial engineering side of things, basically thinking, "How can I use this money and get
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:50.240]   multiple benefits off of it?" But that can be applied, in my mind, at every level of life.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.640]   That's what really appeals to me about the work that you guys are doing. I think of
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.760]   it as a way to get people to think ahead. You have that, let's see, I think it was in your book
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.480]   that I read about, you have your wood stove built where it heats your house and it cooks your food
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.280]   and it warms your water, all the same three functions, right? Absolutely, yeah. You have
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.520]   bacon in it and it dries clothes. It's a clothes dryer. It does five core functions. Describe how
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.440]   that works and how you have that set up. Sure. Well, that's just an old wood cook stove. They've
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:29.920]   been making the same wood cook stove or a similar stove to it for more than 100 years, probably
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.040]   maybe 200 years. The one I happen to have is made in Ireland and I got it used for
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:44.640]   750 bucks on Craigslist. If you just put that in your house, that would save the average person
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:53.040]   about $15,000 to $2,000 a year right off the bat in the first year. From a financial planning
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.960]   perspective, there's not a lot of things that are much smarter than, "Oh, I'll make an investment of
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   one X and save three X in the same year." There's not a lot of things that are that quick of a
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:11.600]   payback, I think. Just from that perspective, it's great, but for us, it has a lot of other
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:17.760]   benefits. It's totally resilient. It's basically a break-proof system. The power was flickering
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.680]   last night in this major snowstorm we've been getting. Erica, my wife, was like, "Oh, I feel
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:29.200]   so bad for people who don't have a wood stove because when the power goes out, their house
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.640]   freezes." We're looking at a system that's just so basic, it's really a no-brainer.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:42.000]   The wood stove doesn't know if the power's on or not. It just keeps doing its thing.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.280]   The simplicity of it and the resilience of that system is really as big of a benefit as its
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   financial function. There's those two key functions. Then the functions that it performs for
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:01.200]   us, like you said, cooking hot water, which is a really exciting function because a lot of people
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.840]   know you can heat your house on a wood stove. Cooking on a wood stove, that's not too new of
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.800]   an idea, but heating hot water with it is just not something we see very often. All it is is
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.040]   there's just a little water jacket in the back of the stove, a little stainless steel tank that
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:25.520]   holds about a gallon. You plumb from the bottom of that tank into a water...I got a free hot
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.000]   water tank that my neighbor was throwing away, an electric hot water tank. Everyone knows what
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.160]   those 40-gallon electric hot water tanks look like. You get one of those, you mount it behind
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.560]   the stove or above the stove. You can put it on a floor above the stove if you want, like on the
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.640]   second floor if the stove's on a first. You basically connect that to this water jacket
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.960]   in the back of the stove. You can hook up any stove with one of these water jackets, but the
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.360]   one we happen to have is made...some of these stoves actually come with a water jacket, but
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.040]   any stove you could retrofit to have a water jacket. It's just a way of that firebox heating
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:05.280]   hot water. As the hot water rises, it...excuse me, as it heats up, it expands, so it rises,
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:11.120]   becomes less buoyant or more buoyant, excuse me. And so hot water rises just like hot air.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.840]   And so you can create a system called a thermosiphon, a convection loop, where the hot
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:22.320]   water moves through the stove into the tank and back through the stove perpetually, cycling itself
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.280]   with no pump. So it's moving itself without the need for a pump. So again, no need for electricity
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.360]   there or some piece of the system that can break or will break like a pump eventually will. And so
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:38.400]   within three, four hours of firing up this wood stove, we have enough heat to heat a 1500 square
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.320]   foot building, and we have like 40 gallons of water at 140 degrees. So there's enough water for
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:51.120]   you know, two very luxurious showers, essentially for free. So that hot water system is just using
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:57.520]   the excess heat of the stove and giving you a whole nother core function, hot water. In a cold
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:04.480]   climate, in a cold climate, hot water is no joke. I mean, being able to take a hot shower is really,
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.160]   you know, it's almost as important as eating in some ways. It's a pretty core function.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:15.360]   So that particular system is really spectacular. I'm just amazed, you know, as people come through
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.640]   our permaculture courses and we show this system or in tours, and they're like, "Well, why don't
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.920]   more people have these?" We've never, you know, most people in our permaculture courses have never
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.040]   seen that system before. And I hadn't really until I built one. I'd seen one once in college,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.960]   but it was a little different. And you know, I always have to say, I really don't know. I,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:42.720]   you know, don't have any idea why these aren't in every home in a cold part of the world.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:48.000]   Well, I mean, I do have an idea. I don't have a sensible idea about it. The only idea
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   I have about it is that, you know, people aren't focused on that. They go flip up their thermostat
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:59.040]   and they pay $2,000 or $4,000 heating bill every year. And that's just how it is. You know,
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.040]   it's not like, well, let's do this a different way. And for us, you know, that different way
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:10.160]   is a kind of core part of our lifestyle. We're very interested in meeting our basic needs and
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.480]   not just burning up a bunch of, you know, fracked propane to have a hot shower. You know, for us,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:26.240]   it's like, why do I need to destroy an aquifer to take a hot shower? You know, like propane mining
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.520]   does to heat your hot water, right? There's that kind of direct consequence. And I'm just not
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:37.760]   someone who can put gas in my car or feel hot water come out of the tap and not think about,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:44.320]   all right, what am I doing to some place to have this water be hot? You know, what's my role
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.280]   in that impact? And that's just, you know, maybe it's a blessing, maybe it's a curse,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.880]   but it's something I always have thought about for most of my life. It's not something I can
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.440]   kind of avoid thinking about just how my, maybe how my head works. And I think a lot of people
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:01.840]   who are into taking care of, taking charge of their own resource use in their own life
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.560]   are probably wired the same way. They just, they want to know, you know, what goes into keeping
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.120]   them alive. But strangely enough, it doesn't seem most people, it seems that most people
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.440]   have an interest in that. So we have the world we live in today, I guess.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.520]   You said you bought your wood stove used. Do you know how old it is?
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:26.000]   It's, I think mine's probably from the seventies. It's a Waterford Stanley.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.120]   What intrigues me about it is if I look at it just from a sheer efficiency perspective.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:41.600]   So if you have a wood stove, that's 40 years old, let's say, and it still is working perfectly fine
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.800]   today. And I would assume if it's anything like the wood stoves I've seen, there's no reason why
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.600]   it couldn't be working perfectly well a hundred years from now, perhaps the water tank would rust
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.560]   out and you'd have to fix that, you know, and replace that. But the basic, the basic stove
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.520]   should maintain its integrity for a century or a couple of centuries. And I think about
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.240]   the efficiency of that design. Now it does have drawbacks, but I was just sitting here thinking
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:10.880]   like all the ways that you can stack functions. So you're heating your house, heating your water,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:16.480]   drying your clothes, baking, you know, baking your bread, cooking your vegetables on that same,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:25.520]   that same stove system, system, plus even just to, to fire it. So you can grow your own wood
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.320]   and growing your own wood has multiple benefits. You can grow your own wood and improve the
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.760]   ecosystem because you are planting and harvesting a tree. You can do that in an intelligent way,
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.640]   whether that's, you know, the systems that have existed for centuries of coppicing the wood,
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.200]   you know, it's simple, low maintenance makes the thing grow, makes the, makes the trees grow.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.720]   You get your exercise, chopping the wood. I would assume that certainly can be a chore,
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.520]   but I would imagine it's less of a chore based upon how efficient the house can be designed
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:02.240]   to where you probably don't need 18 cords of firewood every, every winter to, to heat your
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.960]   home. So you can apply all these benefits and to go and get the, to go and get the wood. It
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.760]   doesn't cost you anything other than the labor involved. And you can hire that done if you need
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.200]   to. But even if you hire the labor done, you buy your wood from a local person who, or pay somebody
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.480]   to come and harvest it on your property. If you have the property, it's still so much more
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:30.320]   efficient than a system of purchasing, you know, liquid petroleum products from hundreds of miles
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:37.040]   away, if that, or maybe shipped across the ocean in a, in a tanker ship to heat your house with.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.920]   It just makes sense to me. It's more efficient. Yeah. Yeah. And like you said, the multipliers
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.400]   are really there. I mean, I didn't think about, I'll use that actually from now on. I think in
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.560]   our permaculture courses, one of the yields of the wood stove of wood heat is that you save however
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.800]   many hundreds of dollars a year on a gym membership. You're absolutely right. You don't, you
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:02.320]   know, it's, it's a gym membership saved to process your own firewood. Not that I'd go get a gym
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:08.480]   membership, but if you did, you know, hauling, cutting, splitting, stacking, hauling again,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.880]   and burning firewood, you know, Robert Foss, the famous quote about wood warms you twice,
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.200]   you know, I actually like to say he'd probably didn't process his wood completely because if
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.880]   it only warmed him twice, then he must've had his wood at least delivered. And then he stacked it
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:26.320]   and hauled it inside. But, uh, so it warmed him, you know, it warms you when you burn it and haul
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   it. So for us, it warms us. Yeah. About five times, let's say. So yeah, the functions are,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:38.000]   are really endless. Like you, like you just illustrated so well. I think just the, the big
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.600]   reason we don't see this more is the one, the one major cost, if you can call it a cost,
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:51.360]   is it just demands a whole different lifestyle approach to really leverage it fully. You know,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.640]   it's not, you don't flick a switch and have the wood stove load, load itself and, and dry your
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.480]   clothes for you. It's, it's not, it's not automated. It's a much more manual lifestyle and
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.120]   you can do a more, and we have worked with a lot of clients who are engaging a more manual, direct
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:12.000]   lifestyle part-time. They're still, you know, they're not like a kind of almost full-time
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.720]   homesteader like myself. They're still business professionals or teaching professionals or
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.520]   whatever else they do, but they're taking on a more manual lifestyle part-time. So you can make
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.440]   great headway part-time and still let's say have wood heat or certainly wood backup heat.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:31.360]   But I think to really engage the full, what I see as the full benefits of the manual lifestyle,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:39.440]   it's probably like a 20 hour a week thing. You know, I don't, I don't think you need to be
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.480]   super hardcore and do a 40, 50, eight hours a week. Like some people certainly do, but I find
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.920]   that there's a, there's a threshold of a, once you're about able to about put about 20 hours a
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:57.120]   week in, you can really have most of your food, almost all your heat and have this very, and all
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.200]   your med, most of the med, if you're healthy, all your medicine, or if you're not very, very sick,
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:09.360]   all your medicine and have most of everything you need most days from the landscape around you.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.840]   You know, without having to be a full-time thing, once you get set up, which does,
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.440]   you know, take, it takes multiple years. It's not something that happens overnight.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:25.920]   But it's, it's, you know, it's, it's a whole bit of a different lifestyle. That's for sure.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:36.240]   And I do try not to romanticize the things that were hard. You know, I know that my grandmother
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:42.640]   grew up or she, she, my, my father grew up on a ranch in the upper high mountains of Colorado.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:48.000]   And, you know, she cooked on a wood stove and cooking on a wood stove is nowhere near as
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.080]   convenient, although I'd never done it, but I'm certain it's nowhere near as convenient as simply
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:57.280]   firing up the electric stove. But if you see the benefits of it, what I think of
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.160]   is all of that is coming from one piece of equipment that can be purchased once and never
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.320]   has to be purchased again. Whereas if I, you know, I need to replace my water heater this,
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.760]   this month. I need, you know, a clothes dryer. What's the length of the potential lifespan of
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.560]   a good clothes dryer? Five years, 10 years, maybe a water heater. All of these things have
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:22.160]   a life cycle. So now I'm permanently needing to replace these appliances over time. Why don't we
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:30.560]   apply the same design intelligence that we have applied to other areas of life, to some of the
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.360]   traditional technologies and improve those technologies without losing some of the things
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:41.520]   that are good about them. So let's design a better wood stove that works more efficiently,
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.840]   more effectively, that keeps heat more easily so that it's easier to cook on and keep the
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.960]   benefits without just going to a completely different technology.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.600]   Yeah. And that brings up a huge point, which I think about a lot,
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:04.640]   which is this kind of the hybridization of the old and new. We tend to, our brain tends to think of
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:12.400]   old ways and new ways and keep them in very separate categories. And think that to learn
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:19.440]   in old way, you know, to know how to grow your own food or heat your house with wood means you can't,
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.960]   you know, be on the cutting edge of new technologies coming out. Or I saw an amazing,
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.600]   it wasn't a spoof, but it should have been a YouTube video of a woman who was
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:35.840]   thanking Steve Jobs for kind of what she put as re-working the operating system for a child.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:42.240]   And it was a video, YouTube video of her kid looking at a magazine and being bored with it
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.240]   because it didn't do anything when she kind of swiped her fingers across the magazine.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   And then she gave the child, probably like a two-year-old,
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.400]   a, you know, iPad or some tablet thing. And the kid was very engaged. And she was like,
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:02.480]   isn't this awesome. My kid now has no need for a magazine. And I see that, like, why not learn
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:10.160]   both? Like, can't modern human beings, shouldn't we be able to learn new things without retreating
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:16.720]   from and becoming illiterate of the old ways. And if they're old and they're still, and they were
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.280]   around for thousands of years, there's some inherent value to them that chances are they're
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.000]   actually might not be to something new, which hasn't stood the test of time yet. So it's like,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.760]   well, you know, we tend to just throw the baby out with the bathwater. And it seems to me, it's like,
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:36.480]   why not keep all the parts, why not keep all the literacies on the table to see what proves
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   themselves over time. And, you know, personally, I use a computer. I mean, I'm on an iPhone right
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:49.840]   now talking with you. I still utilize modern technology greatly if it has leverage that seems
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:57.600]   to be life enhancing in terms of my lifestyle or in terms of helping manifest the work I'm trying
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:05.520]   to manifest in the world to help others. But it doesn't mean I still can't learn how to butcher
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:15.680]   a deer or a goose and keep literate with some of the very old ways of what it's meant to exist as
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.760]   a human being on this planet for a hundred thousand years. Right. Yeah. In my mind, that's,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:28.560]   that is the key is to appreciate and learn the lessons of the past without romanticizing them
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:34.640]   and then integrate the developments without losing the benefits of the past. I find having sat in
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:40.800]   hundreds of meetings with clients about their lifestyle, you know, one of the most common
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.560]   financial goals that I hear is people say, I want to spend more time with my family and I want to
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:53.440]   spend more time with my kids, with my grandkids. And I grew up as a boy, I enjoyed reading the
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:59.040]   Laura Ingalls Wilder series. And my favorite of the series was Farmer Boy. And it was an account
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.520]   of, you know, a traditional farming family. And I thought to myself, I've always thought,
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:10.160]   how much time did that father and that son spend together? Well, they spent a good amount of time,
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:16.800]   but they also had a lot of time doing hard work, but they were together, at least in that hard work.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:23.120]   So here we were making this transition of, I like spending time with my family. Now we all,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.440]   the whole family is disintegrated and now people are wanting to get back to it, but it's not that
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:31.920]   hard to get back to it. You just got to make some conscious decisions and different choices
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:37.360]   to follow through and think about what the direct way to meet your goals would be.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:45.440]   Yeah. Yeah. And it is, it's a very good point. I mean, a lot of the trade, the trade we've made,
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:53.440]   the kind of the gamble we've made in the modern lifestyle is that we'll have more of what we love,
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:49:03.760]   we'll be more and we'll get more and that will make us be more by, you know, kind of specializing
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:09.040]   our lives to the extent that we have and essentially working always through the medium of
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.400]   money to have the life we want. And I think, I think we're going to see, we're already starting
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:23.040]   to see an era herald in now where the belief in that promise is fading because I think we're
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.680]   realizing just like you said, most of your clients want to just have that basic need to spend more
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.240]   time with their family. You know, that, the promise that was put out there post-World War II with
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:38.080]   like, you know, science and tech, the convenience, the utter convenience of science and technology is,
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:44.320]   you know, there's pieces of it, but it's just not that simple. It's not, it can't deliver in such a
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:48.960]   simple way. And I think we're, we're starting to realize this and that is where I think the modern
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:55.040]   homesteading movement is just one, one of many responses to that, to that place in history.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:02.000]   We find ourselves now where we have some very basic needs that are going unmet, even, you know,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.920]   even in a family where the parents make, you know, a hundred thousand dollars a year or more, you
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.560]   know, which should be completely adequate to have like a lot of personal freedom to do the things
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.200]   we love to do. But, but it's that, you know, the rat race is a really good term for it. You know,
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:25.760]   it's a pretty, pretty precise term. There are two themes I'd like to explore with you as we
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:33.120]   kind of start to wrap up here. And the first theme is the concept of resilience. You,
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.520]   obviously that's an important feature to you in that it was the part of the title of your book,
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.000]   the resilient farm and homestead. And it really impressed me the way that you approach that
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.280]   of simply in your design thinking of saying, I don't know what changes are going to come,
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:56.640]   but how can I prepare a design that will handle those changes? And that's a question I get a lot
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.320]   with financial planning is what's going to happen. And I think, well, I don't know what's going to
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.840]   happen. So how can we plan so that no matter what happens in the future, that our needs are
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:12.080]   cared for? Could you go over first, some of the reasons why you think of, you try to think about
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.840]   resilience in your planning and then some of the methods that you employ to deal with that?
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.400]   Sure. Yeah. Well, I agree with you. I think I'm one who tends to believe that,
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.920]   you know, I'm not going to gamble on predicting the future because it seems like it's somewhat
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.080]   unpredictable. Even things like global warming. You know, I don't like the term global warming.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.880]   I like the term global weirding because it's a complex system. The Earth's climate,
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:43.200]   things could get colder. I like to take the approach of let's plan for all scenarios. And
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.600]   we call that in our books scenario planning, which is actually a term I've become aware of since
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.000]   writing the book is actually a term that that other systems thinkers have already used.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.600]   But the idea being let's plan for as many scenarios as possible. Think of the most likely
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:05.200]   events you think might transpire and plan for those first. I'm certainly not saying plan for
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:11.440]   the least likely events first, plan for the most likely events first, for sure. But that doesn't
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:16.800]   mean wipe all the other possibilities off the table. You know, plan for those as well, especially
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:22.720]   once you get, you know, your proverbial together, once you get your house in order, once you get
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:28.160]   your home. When I say house, I don't mean a house necessarily literally, although I mean it literally
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:34.880]   and figuratively. Once you get your own economics in order, your own basic lifestyle in order,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:42.400]   then you can start drilling down the long list of other possible future scenarios that you might
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:48.080]   want to have your life be resilient in the face of. Now, that could be any number of things. I mean,
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:53.360]   it could be a large bump in how our global industrial food system functions, because we know
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:53:00.880]   you don't have to be someone who studies up on it every day to realize there's major vulnerability
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:08.880]   to the global food system, whether it's with pests or, you know, plant diseases or supply and
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:15.600]   distribution, supply chain problems, whatever it might be, fuel supply problems, there's a
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:21.040]   vulnerability there. So if you're interested in engaging that possibility, you start looking at
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:28.720]   solutions like maybe developing some local food system that's not from, that's not a thousand
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:34.560]   miles away, maybe it's a hundred feet away in your front yard. Same with your heat, you know,
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:40.000]   your firewood, or same with your water, hopefully, because we all need water, you know, most every
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.720]   day. Same with financial resources, you know, could be tools and skills versus just a lot of
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:52.800]   money in the bank account or along with a lot of money in the bank account. So I guess just to
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.000]   circle back to your question, I mean, we look at it in a lot of different ways, but mainly from
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.160]   a scenario planning perspective. And a lot of our clients who we assist come to us already,
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.480]   the way I put it is they're kind of pre-sold, they're already, they already see what they
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:16.960]   think is the writing on the wall and they see a global techno-industrial system, call it whatever
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:25.840]   you like, that when it works just right, it's pretty awesome for the people who are at the top.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   But when it, if it's not working just right, which they think might be the case here and there for at
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:39.360]   least periods of time, it might not be so great for anyone. And so they're kind of working, as I
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:46.880]   say, to get their house in order in the face of those potential challenges. But I guess, you know,
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:52.080]   I would also define risk too, to try to answer in a roundabout way your question, hopefully,
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:55:02.960]   risk being the likelihood of an event happening times the severity of the consequences of those,
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:09.120]   of an event happening. So like, I think the example I use in my book is a meteor, you know,
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:15.360]   comet hitting the earth, right? It's hopefully not very likely, but if it happens, it's very severe,
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:21.120]   you know, game over, change of epochs, right? We'll have to wait a billion years or something for
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:28.080]   maybe millions for some other, you know, next chapter to unfold, but it's not very likely. So
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:33.760]   the risk of that is relatively low, hopefully, if it's unlikely, which we don't really know,
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:41.040]   versus something like I lose my job, you know, I get fired at some point in the next 20 years.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:48.320]   The consequences of that are not as high as the comet, but it's much more likely to happen,
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:53.680]   or just I get sick or I break my leg. Consequences are lower, although they're real,
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:59.600]   but the likelihood is higher. So maybe overall risk is higher in those situations. So just basic
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:06.080]   risk assessment and risk planning is something that we bring into our process as well when it
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.360]   comes to resiliency. And then there's a lot of other principles which I elaborate on in the book,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:18.640]   but just a basic principle of redundancy and having multiple ways to meet very basic needs,
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:24.960]   like water. You need water. So we have a well. If and when the well pump fails, well, we have
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:29.840]   rainwater off the roof. If that's not working for some reason, we have ponds, we can cut a hole in
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.840]   the ice with a handful of different tools we have on site to get water out of the ponds. You know,
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:42.240]   we could melt snow on a wood stove, which we have multiple stashes of dry wood for,
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.440]   and they don't need electricity to run, etc. So there's a lot of, you know, redundancy in the
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:52.320]   system is very important, and the simplicity of a system is very important. And there's a lot of
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:58.000]   other pieces as well I get at in the book, but things like legibility, which often aren't thought
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:05.760]   about, like how legible is whatever system you're depending upon to you? Do you understand it? Do
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:11.920]   you know how to fix your furnace if it breaks, right? Or do you know how to deal with a system
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:17.120]   when it fails? Because we've built in, in our specialized modern world, we've built in so much
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:22.480]   illegibility, right? If your iPhone breaks, you don't think, "Oh, well, I could probably fix it.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:27.120]   You know, let me open it up. Maybe I could fix it this time. It might be a small problem." It's just
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:32.400]   like, I go back to the store and get a new iPod because there is no fix. You know, there is no
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:38.560]   legibility in like the maintenance of that type of system. Now, sometimes that's inherent in very
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:45.120]   high technology, but it's certainly, if it's inherent in technologies we need to meet our
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.760]   basic needs, then we have a very brittle situation, and we're in a very vulnerable
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:57.840]   situation then, which I don't think is very attractive to anyone. The last theme, and I'm
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:03.520]   actually might add one more after this, but the last thing that I wanted to ask you about is the
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:12.320]   concept of how to design for your needs from a financial perspective and from a, basically,
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.120]   a building financial resilience. I often get asked, there is more fear than I've ever seen in my life,
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:24.800]   but more people have fear of potential failures in financial systems, and we've seen some failures
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.280]   over past years. People are concerned about failures of monetary systems, failures of
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:36.320]   banking systems, etc. I've been asked about this dozens and dozens and dozens of times,
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:45.120]   and I have some ideas, but ultimately I find that when people are very fearful of massive failures
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:51.360]   in financial systems, my answer to them has been, "There's not a financial solution to a
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:59.360]   financial system failure," and their ultimate solution is to get out of the financial system.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:04.880]   Financial wealth, financial assets are not real assets. They're a system that we've invented
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:12.000]   to account for real assets, for real wealth. So, don't look to the financial system to protect
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.640]   yourself if you're concerned about a failure of the financial system, because you're just doing
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   this self-reinforcing problem where you're depending on a system that you're saying,
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:27.200]   "I'm concerned about it failing." If you're really concerned, think through it from an
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:33.440]   out-of-the-box perspective. If somebody came to you with that fear from your perspective as a whole
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:38.960]   systems designer, where would you start them on the road as far as saying, "How can I protect
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.040]   myself and my family and my wealth?" How would you guide them on that road?
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:52.000]   Yeah, let me just think about that for a second, because that's quite...
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:59.680]   There's a lot of levels to that. I think, as with a lot of things, I think it would highly depend
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.800]   upon who that person was and what resources they had and what inclinations and what talents they'd
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.200]   have. So, I guess the first thing I would look at is, just like we talked about with the loads
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.760]   analysis of an off-grid building at the beginning of our conversation, what resources do you have
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:21.040]   available to you? Do you have a large family that lives in the town that you live in? If so, great,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:28.320]   that could play into this resiliency picture that we're trying to get at through your question.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:36.160]   If not, if everyone's dead or lives somewhere else, okay, that's not a resource. Maybe you
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:43.600]   have a resource that you're a roofer and you could fix your neighbor's roofs in a certain
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.120]   situation. You have something you can offer the people that live around you, or you're a farmer
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:56.880]   or a plumber, or you're really great at taking care of kids or taking care of animals or organizing
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.040]   people. They can be soft skills too, but essentially just firstly asking the question,
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:06.480]   what are your resources? What do you really have to capitalize on? And capitalize on,
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.680]   in other words, capitalize being a poor choice of words, capitalize on as in manifesto,
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:20.560]   in a non-financial way, in a more direct human to human relationship way.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:28.000]   So I think I would start the conversation on that front to really understand a little bit
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.440]   of analysis, like what are the resources that people have to bring to the table?
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:38.640]   And then we all have very similar needs as human beings. So that's where being a permaculture
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.880]   designer is kind of handy because we all need to eat. It's seemingly most of us need to eat
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.720]   most days. So that's a basic need we all share, no matter who the client is, the fictitious client
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.760]   we're referring to right now. They'll need to eat, they'll need water, they'll need warmth,
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:04.560]   they'll need shelter, housing, community, safety. So all of those are common needs.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.560]   So we have to also think about how to provision for those basic needs.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.920]   And then you start getting into some of the things we've already talked about in this conversation,
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:22.000]   I think, about those basic systems. But I think there's a lot to that. That's a difficult question.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.160]   I mean, maybe, is there some particular part of that question you're thinking of that you'd like
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:35.280]   me to hit on? No, I think that's good enough. And to respond to how I've told people, I've said,
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.760]   "Listen, if you are really concerned, because today there's a lot of fear about this,
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.080]   then you've just given the answer that I've given." I said, "If you're really concerned about it,
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:52.240]   there's not a financial solution that can help you. The key is provide for your needs. And then,
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.880]   as far as wealth, you need to invest your wealth that you currently have into a way where it has
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.520]   the potential to multiply. So then you have to go through a self-analysis perspective and say,
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.320]   'What skills and abilities and knowledge do I have? Then what are the needs and the desires of
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.480]   the marketplace? And how can I find the intersection between these things to meet
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.680]   the skills and the desires of the marketplace?' And one of your constraints might be that you
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.760]   build into your plan. You might put a constraint in, depending on what your focus is. So if you
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:33.600]   are, in your situation, you're a designer, that's a very useful skill set. And your remuneration can
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:40.720]   be in the form of dollars, and it can also be in the form of other forms of wealth, whether that's
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:46.720]   labor, whether that's gifts, whether that's the needs of life. This is how humanity's developed,
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.000]   is by paying attention to these basic needs and then finding ways to fulfill them. And the
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.520]   monetary system is, in many ways, a marvel of efficiency. And yet it does have weaknesses.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.240]   So exploit the weaknesses and take advantage of the other things, but see through it and then look
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.320]   at it from a design perspective. Businesses that provide value, no matter what the monetary system
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.360]   is, no matter what the question is, no matter what the currency denomination is, those businesses and
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:22.400]   the people that control them will always accrue wealth because ultimately the money is a system
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.360]   of measuring the things that are really important. You can either grow the wood on your lot and you
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.800]   can go out and cut it, or you can grow the wood on your lot and you can pay somebody to cut it,
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.920]   or you can have somebody else grow the wood and cut it and bring you the wood, or you can do it
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.480]   with something else. They're all meeting the same basic human need, we're just meeting them in
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:50.480]   different ways depending on what resources we have. Absolutely. Yeah, I certainly agree with that.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:56.240]   So I guess the last question, and almost a corollary of the previous one, I find myself,
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:01.840]   this is for me personally, not a fictitious person, me living with my family here in West
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:08.400]   Palm Beach, I find myself continually inspired by what other people have been able to do and the
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.440]   resilience they've been able to build into their lives and the improvements in their lifestyle and
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.880]   their security and their health and their homestead and all of that, but I find myself struggling to
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.760]   figure out how to actually do it in my situation. So I'm not in a cold climate and I'm in a
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:30.720]   subtropical warm climate, and so I don't have a problem of heating a house, I have a problem of
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:37.280]   cooling a house. So I'm continually stuck trying to figure out what do I actually need to do,
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:42.960]   what's the next thing for me to focus on. For me or for someone like me who's inspired but
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:49.280]   doesn't know where to turn next, what thoughts would you have as far as how to lay out a system
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:58.800]   of self-education and also how to lay out a learning process, like how to coach myself through
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.920]   learning and acquiring the skills that I need to learn to improve my homestead?
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:10.160]   Right. Well, I think there's a few ways. I think there's three things that maybe would be identified
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:16.720]   right off. The first would be like maybe the last or it would be woven throughout, you just brought
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:22.800]   that up. What's the learning process? How can you learn the most important things you need to know
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:30.080]   to increase your resiliency in your own lifestyle where you are in your context, like you're saying?
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:36.480]   And the other two things, so those might be like books, people, videos, whatever.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:44.720]   And the other two things that I think I've read off the bat are local resources, which is connected
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:51.040]   with the learning piece, but it's also inspirational as well as informational. So who around you
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.880]   seems to have a better situation? If you're thinking, "Oh, I want something that I don't
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:01.200]   have. I want to move in some direction that I'm not far enough along in right now," when you're
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:07.040]   saying, let's say, resiliency, do you know anyone around you in Southern California, and I'm sure
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:14.400]   you probably do, who is further along in that path than you are and what do they do? Spending
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.880]   time with them, spending time with their systems, learning as much as you can from those systems,
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:25.840]   identifying what's great about their systems and maybe what's not, and just being able to hear from
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.800]   those people, learning with those people. And then the other piece, which is what we do with
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.400]   clients quite often is what I would call like a resiliency audit, which is just looking at your
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   own basic lifestyle needs, whether it's money, water, food, cooling or heat, shelter, your basic
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:55.120]   systems, and how resilient are each of those systems and drilling down each one. So, okay,
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:00.720]   where I live in Southern California, let's say in an urban context, where's my water coming from?
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.960]   I can already know from being in Southern California before, that's not going to be the
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:12.400]   best picture of resiliency right off the bat. Could it be? Maybe not. But how could it be
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.000]   improved? That might be actually a real tricky one, for sure, because some places you're not
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.160]   even allowed to collect the rainwater off your roof, or if you do, it might be kind of polluted,
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.560]   or you don't maybe own the roof, so you can't collect the rainwater off the roof. So sometimes
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:33.600]   a resiliency audit may lead someone to actually move, and that's okay if it does.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:40.400]   If someone wants to be serious about it, you may look into food and maybe you have a small front
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:46.720]   yard that gets some sun, so you may realize, okay, I could have some food production here.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.080]   Or you may realize, actually food production isn't the way I could be most food resilient,
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.800]   and maybe actually becoming friends with a farmer might be. It's not always as simple as
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.680]   well, I want food resiliency, thus I should grow more food. Often that's the case, but only in
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.160]   certain contexts. If you don't have land in your urban area, that's probably not the solution.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:15.360]   But it doesn't mean you can't get closer to food resiliency, albeit with a little bit of
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:24.320]   a disclaimer that there are certain resiliency sweet spots, if you will, that are probably
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:31.920]   found best in a relatively rural place, but where there's a lot of community and some density of
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:38.000]   people. It's not the full backwoods-y shotgun shack situation, and it's probably not the
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:47.600]   uptown Manhattan or downtown Los Angeles situation either. So there are some contexts which
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.400]   certainly are inherently more resilient than others, that's very important to mention.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:10:00.160]   That being said, it doesn't mean we all can't improve our resilience greatly, no matter our
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:07.520]   context. Ben, I appreciate you making the time to come and allocate your time to share with us and
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.080]   to teach us. I really appreciate it. So your website is wholesystemsdesign.com. And then
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:17.600]   also, aren't you doing a Kickstarter right now? We are. It's actually about to end in a few days,
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.400]   but one more week or so. We're doing it on our permaculture courses to make them available in
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:34.080]   video. It's called Permaculture Skills. If someone were to Google that Kickstarter,
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.080]   they'd find it. Has it been fully funded enough yet? Or are you still needing it? Yeah,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:44.320]   it's actually, they just made a stretch goal to translate the courses into, or the lessons,
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.600]   into French. And they actually met that stretch goal, I think, recently as well. But the courses
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.440]   are happening every summer, so people can check that online as well. That's exciting. If it's
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.320]   anything like any of the rest of your work, I'm sure it'll be beautiful. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.840]   It'll be really cool. So thanks again so much for coming on today. I appreciate it.
