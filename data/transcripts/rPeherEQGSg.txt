[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   All right, let's move on.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.420]   Now we got a question from Frank.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.720]   Frank asks, "What kind of processes you go through
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.020]   "to figure out what projects to commit to?
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.200]   "I feel that much of the conversation of productivity
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.980]   "is around figuring out how to tackle everything
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.800]   "that is on my plate.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.300]   "There is advice on working efficiently through that,
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.460]   "as well as ways to get some of the stuff off my plate.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.280]   "This is all great stuff, but what about making sure
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.880]   "that the work that I get put on my plate
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.140]   "is the best choice for my skills and my goals?"
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.480]   Well, Frank, this is a perfect excuse for me
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.400]   to remind everyone about the productivity funnel,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.560]   a concept from earlier in the podcast
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.840]   that I think is worth reviewing
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.660]   'cause it's very relevant to your question.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.200]   So let me see here.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.540]   I actually could draw a picture.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.720]   In theory, I'm gonna try this.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.800]   I'm gonna draw a picture of the funnel.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.380]   So here we have, for those who are watching at home,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.280]   we now have the screen back up.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.260]   So just for those who don't remember,
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.760]   the productivity funnel has three levels,
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.120]   which I will expertly draw.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.160]   Keeping in mind all three levels
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.040]   is what's gonna be important for actually
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.380]   getting a good answer to your question here, Frank.
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.000]   All right, so if we're gonna label these levels,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.080]   what are we gonna get?
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.960]   At the bottom is where we have,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.720]   and people who are watching along at home,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.440]   see, I have impeccable handwriting.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.840]   I'm still learning this pen.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.720]   I don't know, Jessie, what would you think?
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.040]   That looks like someone having a stroke
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.200]   because they were drinking too much.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.840]   And in the middle of that process,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   the drunk person having a stroke was writing the word.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.920]   So I'll rewrite it.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   So what I was trying to write here
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.240]   is the word execution.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.240]   I'm labeling the bottom level of the three-level funnel.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.160]   There we go, that looks better.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.980]   - Yeah, that looks good.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.240]   - With execution.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.920]   Above that, the middle level of the productivity funnel,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   we can label organization.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.240]   And then the top level,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.760]   and this is where it gets relevant, Frank,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.040]   let's just summarize, I call this different things,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.380]   but for now let's call it selection.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.320]   All right, so we have this funnel.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.580]   Selection, organization, and execution.
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.720]   Whoops, I just accidentally moved everything on the screen.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.800]   Not to worry.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.640]   Boom, now we're back.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.920]   All right, and so what happens is you have
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.200]   a lot of possible things coming into this.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.040]   Oh, man.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.800]   I'm doing all sorts of interesting things
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.000]   on my screen down here.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.220]   There we go.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.520]   Oh my goodness.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.880]   There we go.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.840]   I'm getting good at this.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.040]   It's not riveting radio,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.160]   but I'm actually making a lot of progress
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.000]   on this technology.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.060]   So you have a bunch of possible activities
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.400]   coming to the top of this productivity funnel.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.640]   And let me just scroll this up so we can see it.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.920]   And then what happens?
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.100]   Okay, all right, so now I have the whole picture drawn.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.280]   Again, for those listening at home,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.960]   I'm sure you love the riveting radio here,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.760]   but I have a three-level funnel drawn.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.600]   At the top, widest part of the funnel is selection.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.400]   The middle level of the funnel is organization.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.480]   At the bottom is execution.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.040]   And there's a bunch of stuff coming
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.840]   in the top of the funnel.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   These are potential activities.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.080]   So when it comes to productivity,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.920]   there's three parts to it.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.480]   Selection is actually trying to figure out
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.960]   of these things that are incoming,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   of these things that are incoming to the funnel,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.740]   which of them am I actually going to bring into my system
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.840]   and actually hope to execute at some point?
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.560]   So a lot of the things coming in
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.920]   get blocked right at this point.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.680]   We'll talk about more about this in a second, Frank,
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.040]   because it's at the core of your question.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.160]   But just so you know how these pieces fit together,
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.720]   the things that make it through selection
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.000]   then have to be organized.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.680]   So where are they kept track of?
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.160]   Where's the information associated
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.480]   with them getting track of?
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.040]   Where is the plans that may lay out how they're executed?
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.280]   When do those plans get made?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.080]   How do those plans get consulted?
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.600]   What role do they have in their life?
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.520]   All of that happens within organization.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.400]   So for example, this is where you'll have capture systems.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.680]   This is where you're going to have
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.200]   your quarterly, weekly planning,
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.680]   your quarterly, weekly, daily planning,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.760]   where you're figuring out big picture plans,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.980]   that goes down to a weekly plan.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.380]   You figure out what you'll be doing each day.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.820]   So there's a lot of work that goes into
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.840]   organizing what's on your plate.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.540]   And then often missed is the bottom,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.960]   smallest level of the funnel, which is execution.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.480]   We figure out, well, now that I know
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.320]   what I'm supposed to be doing right now, how do I do it?
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.880]   Okay, and this is where things like
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.520]   deep work or the shallow work, minimizing context,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.840]   switching rituals, locations, scheduling philosophies,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.360]   all the things you do to actually execute your work
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.400]   at the highest level, that goes there.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.880]   This is also where tools that make you more efficient
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.240]   when you're doing shallow tasks
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.760]   that would benefit from efficiency,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.480]   they would go here as well.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.440]   All three of these go into this big picture idea
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.760]   of productivity.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.320]   Now, Frank, based on your question,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.900]   you're focusing when you think about productivity
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.520]   mainly on the middle level organization.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.980]   A lot of people make that same distinction.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.760]   So the nuts and bolts of how I keep track of and schedule
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.920]   and organize everything on my plate,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.560]   people often think about that's what productivity means,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.920]   but that's just the middle part.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.120]   You need it, without it, it's chaos.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.520]   You're the list reactive method,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.980]   just pulling things off of your inbox
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.040]   and trying to keep your head above water.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   But it is not by itself gonna give you
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.360]   a complete approach to being productive.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.240]   That is having a transition from possible inputs to outputs
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   that matches whatever criteria are important to you.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.800]   You're gonna need that activity selection
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.360]   to come in place first.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.140]   So what I'm trying to do here with this funnel, Frank,
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.420]   is emphasize that figuring out
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.040]   what to bring onto your plate or not
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.640]   should be at the core of any thinking about productivity.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.680]   And this is deep thinking.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.520]   I mean, this is figuring out like,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.700]   what do I do for a living?
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.880]   What is my role?
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.920]   What are the things I'm gonna focus on on my role?
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.440]   What are the things that are overwhelming me?
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.680]   What is the work volume I can actually manage?
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.640]   And where am I now?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.480]   And am I beyond it?
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.440]   And how do I figure out how not to go beyond it?
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.000]   This is where you have the hard conversations with your boss.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.600]   It's where you do deep to shallow work tracking
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.720]   and use those metrics to say,
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.240]   this is too much on my plate.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.680]   It's where when you move something
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   from just individual messages
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.240]   in which work is implicitly attached,
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.560]   you move over towards something transparent,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.680]   like a task board,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.420]   where you can see all of the work that needs to be done
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.160]   and who's doing what.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.920]   So you can point to that and say,
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.640]   look at how overloaded this is.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.480]   This is where you, when you switch from push to pull,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.760]   okay, I have another free slot.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.160]   Hey, everyone, what should I do next?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.640]   As opposed to just send me stuff when you think of it
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.800]   and I'll take care of it.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.640]   All of these things fall under the rubric
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   of activity selection.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.560]   And it is the part of the funnel
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.000]   that gets the least amount of attention.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.400]   Organization is like the meaty, sexy stuff, right?
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.080]   Oh my God, I have my notion thing set up
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.240]   and I'm using Trello in the sophisticated way.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.520]   And I have these different planners.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.480]   That's like the meaty productivity prawn stuff.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.560]   Execution, that bottom part of the funnel,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.080]   that's the real fun stuff.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.120]   That's the, you know, I built my deep work shed
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.760]   and I go through the hike through the woods.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.200]   That's really fulfilling and fun.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.640]   It's the try to in the moment
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.200]   getting the most out of your work.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.000]   But activity selection gets ignored.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.120]   Even though it's the very top of the funnel.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.260]   So it impacts everything that comes below.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.160]   It's what gets ignored.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.920]   And a lot of the issues we have right now,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.080]   I think in knowledge work, the burnout issues,
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.680]   the overload issues all comes from
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.800]   ignoring activity selection.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   And instead just letting stuff fly at us,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   randomly doing our best to keep our head above water
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.840]   and occasionally calling uncle
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.580]   when it becomes too hard to stay afloat.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.780]   So Frank, I want you to emphasize activity selection.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.680]   I want to encourage you to keep in mind that this is hard.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.520]   I want to underscore the notion
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.800]   that there's many different things that go into
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.760]   trying to figure out that activity selection
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.600]   piece of your funnel.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.800]   It's not just a simple strategy
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.200]   you can put into place tomorrow,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.600]   but I'm glad you're thinking about it.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.760]   And it's what you really need to be focusing on.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.360]   I'm getting better at this, Jesse, I would say.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.560]   I still have quite a few bumps in my pen handling,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.040]   but I like this tablet.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.240]   And also I'm a fantastic artist.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.800]   I think people who are listening
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.120]   and not watching the YouTube video,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.040]   so they can't confirm this.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.680]   Let me just say what I drew,
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.200]   the productivity funnel was beautiful,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.920]   perfectly proportional, well-shaded.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.080]   My handwriting is fantastic.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.760]   And for those who can see this on the video,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.440]   don't tell them, that's not nearly true.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.680]   - Related to golf, it's like,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.480]   but you're also like using other people's clubs.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.200]   So like once you get your Apple Pen,
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.960]   you'll be, you know, cruising.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.800]   - That's true.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.320]   So I teach with the same software.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   So when I teach in the classroom,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.840]   I was a blackboard teacher
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.440]   because I do theory and mathematics
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.240]   and I don't want to show PowerPoint slides.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.380]   There's a natural pacing to writing,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.920]   but my handwriting is very bad.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.760]   And a lot of the chalkboards at Georgetown are no good.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.120]   They're pitted, so you erase them once
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.480]   and the whole thing is white.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.160]   And so I figured out it was really the pandemic
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.360]   that forced me to switch over to this technology.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.320]   During the pandemic,
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.600]   I began when we were doing Zoom teaching
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.480]   using my iPad as a whiteboard.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.960]   And then I would share the screen on Zoom.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.400]   And so then when we got back into the classroom last year,
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.240]   I realized, oh, I could project my iPad
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.480]   on the big screen at the front of the room.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.280]   And so now I'm writing on my iPad,
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.720]   but it's projected up on the big screen.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.700]   So it's equivalent to me writing on a big whiteboard,
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.640]   except for it's on my iPad and I can save all the notes
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.920]   and send them to the students.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.860]   And I can scroll and go back to things I wrote before.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.640]   So we're using the exact same setup here for the show.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.600]   So you think I'd be quicker at it,
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.800]   but I am using Jesse's pen.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.920]   - Yeah, which isn't as good as your pen.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.760]   - That's true.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.600]   - I have a good pen.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.920]   (upbeat music)
