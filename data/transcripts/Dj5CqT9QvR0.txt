[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.320]   - So these days there's increased use of nicotine pouches,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.640]   gums, not just smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.560]   And it's certainly a stimulant.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.720]   And certainly a lot of people,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.760]   in particular young males, are using it more often.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.640]   The traditional media is now trying to create
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.360]   this kind of picture of nicotine being part of the
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.060]   kind of wellness and fitness community.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.960]   But in my observation, many, many more people
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.960]   outside of that category are using it.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.840]   So what, in your experience, happens when somebody with ADHD,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.660]   let's assume they're not medicating in any other way,
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.460]   starts dabbling in nicotine use.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.120]   And let's assume they're gonna do this
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.180]   in ways that do not cause cancer,
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.760]   because the smoking, dipping, vaping, snuffing part
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.880]   is what causes the cancer.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.180]   Let's just talk about the compound nicotine.
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.920]   - Yeah, so there's some well-done research
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.140]   showing nicotine is helpful for improving
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.400]   some of the executive functions, sustained attention,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.800]   and I'm not sure which of the executive functions,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.320]   but they help people focus, be sharper, do better.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.920]   There was actually a major pharmaceutical company
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.160]   who was developing a nicotine receptor product
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.680]   specifically for ADHD and they abandoned that several years ago.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.420]   And I haven't been able to find word as to why that was abandoned,
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.040]   whether there was some other side effect.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.080]   It's worth throwing out there that although nicotine, in many ways,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   acts like a stimulant, it actually is moderately unique.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.600]   And I hate people whose unique means one of a kind, so I can't modify it in any way.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.000]   Unusual, maybe not the only one, unusual in that it both arouses people
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.720]   and reduces anxiety simultaneously.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.560]   Not too many, most of our stimulants are, again, banging away at the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.880]   and that's banging away on good arousal and bad arousal.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.240]   So nicotine, again, seems to be both calming and helping alert or focus people.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.640]   And as long as they're taking it in a way that's not clearly detrimental to their health,
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.240]   which smoking and vaping and probably chewing are, well, not probably, definitely are.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.920]   And if it's affordable, because some of these products are pretty pricey,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.520]   at least the chewing gums or the Nicorette that was used for helping people with smoking cessation.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.560]   I have some people who feel that it's been an important and useful part of their regimen.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.480]   I have some people, small numbers, who prefer it to any other medications.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.640]   And almost no, again, other than sort of the basic
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.920]   neurophysiology showing that it can have beneficial effects on executive functions,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.640]   there's no research, at least as of a year or two ago, whenever I dipped my toe,
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.200]   not my anything else into the snuff, looked into it.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:17.520]   There's no, you know, clinical research showing does this help or not help.
