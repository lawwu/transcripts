[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Now here's a question I've had for a while. Why don't companies who have direct incentive to
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.840]   get the best possible information on themselves, on the factors affecting their business,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.480]   why aren't they using internal prediction markets if this is the best way to aggregate information?
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:26.960]   All right, this is going to be fun. Today I have the pleasure of speaking with my friend,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.120]   Stephen Grugot. He's the founder of Manifold Markets, which has received a grant from Scott
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.680]   Alexander. Scott has written thousands of words about these guys, and they've raised a $2 million
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.120]   seed round. It's an incredibly exciting project. So Stephen, why don't you tell us a little bit
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.840]   about Manifold Markets? Great. Thanks so much for having me on this podcast, Orkesh. It's great to
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.480]   be on here after seeing other people like Tyler Cowen and David Deutsch. I guess first thing,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.160]   I'm one of three co-founders of Manifold Markets. But what we're doing is building a platform for
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.360]   user-created prediction markets. So the idea is that anyone can come onto our site and create
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.960]   a question about anything that they care about. And then they can have their friends and other
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000]   people on our site come bet on that. And the betting process through the magic of our market
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.080]   mechanism will help get the best and most calibrated probabilities that you could find.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.000]   So let's talk about the mechanism here. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea is
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.400]   you use real money to buy Manifold dollars. What is your reason for expecting that people will care
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.680]   a lot about how many Manifold dollars they have? So what is your hypothesis about human nature and
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.400]   reputation that makes you think this is something people are going to invest a lot of effort and
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.880]   time into calibrating? Yeah. So I guess to take a step back for people listening to this, Manifold
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.920]   uses a play money currency. If you sign up right now, we'll give you a thousand Manifold dollars,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.000]   which is our in-platform currency for you to use and bet as you see fit. But the reason why we
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   think that play money can work is that people are driven more by status and competitiveness
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   than greed. We kind of see ourselves as a social game where people can come on to hone their skills
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.920]   at predicting and then demonstrate to others that they really do know more about what they're
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.160]   talking about, and they can prove it with an objective track record from their betting history.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.320]   Yeah. That's a very interesting point, which makes me wonder, do you expect that in the future,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.960]   Wall Street firms will be enticed to get the top people on the leaderboards on Manifold markets
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.160]   to come work for them? One of the objections that Tyler Cowen has to
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.760]   prediction markets is, he's kind of tongue-in-cheek about this, but I remember at one
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.320]   point him saying, "If you guys are so good at predicting stuff, you would expect all these
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   hedge funds to be trying to constantly hire you guys. The fact that they're not makes me think
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.760]   that this is kind of just a hobby." So I'm curious about your reaction. Do you expect
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.200]   people to be coveting these top predictors for their prowess at predicting the future?
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.440]   Yeah, I'm obviously very biased, but I think something like that is possible.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.560]   I think we have a leaderboard right now. Our top predictors are actually quite good.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.640]   The person who's currently occupying the top slot won big on one of our markets on whether
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.600]   Russia would invade Ukraine in February. So in the forecasting community in general,
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.360]   there actually is, as you would expect, a fair amount of overlap between the people who are
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.120]   using these services and financial professionals who actually do manage money or trading as their
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.320]   profession. So I don't entirely agree with the premise of the question or Tyler Cowen's earlier
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.000]   point. Although obviously, as a play money platform, we do attract a fair number of
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.280]   hobbyists who, despite not having a financial background, still are quite good. I do believe
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.040]   that there is a lot of untapped potential in these top predictors and that sites like ours
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.800]   actually are able to identify them. In your experience, what has made people who
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.080]   are the top predictors so good at the art? Is it just their domain knowledge? I know there's
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.680]   different theories about how people can get good at predicting. Based on your experience,
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.040]   what kind of traits do you identify here? So probably a big one is just experience.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.080]   A lot of our top predictors have actually come from other sites and have spent a good
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.480]   deal of time thinking about forecasting and prediction in general. Probably the first hurdle
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.520]   that most people have to overcome in order to start improving as a predictor is getting used to
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.600]   clarifying and crystallizing your views about the world. If you're thinking about some political
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:03.040]   event, you can very easily incorrectly misremember that you got some event right or not. But if
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   you're not actively putting out numerical predictions and recording those to keep yourself
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.000]   honest, it's very difficult to improve. That's a good first step, and a lot of our users already
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.920]   cleared that before joining our site. We talked about whether finance firms would
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.520]   want to hire these predictors, but it would be incredibly exciting if we lived in a world where
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.120]   news firms would want to hire the people who are very good at predicting.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.480]   Scott Alexander actually has a very interesting post where he speculates,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.520]   what if you had investigative reporters who could short—let's say they discovered that
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.880]   some government has really fucked up. They could short the market on the government's GDP in a year
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.520]   and then release the information and then benefit from their investigative journalism.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.880]   I don't know if you're able to react to those kinds of ideas.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.240]   Oh, I think that's great. I think that's great. I think that's a very obvious case
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.400]   of pro-social benefit of markets using the market mechanism to—or in some ways,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.440]   it's kind of like providing a public good that society otherwise wouldn't be able to produce.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.840]   Getting accurate information about corporate malpractices or whatever is very valuable to
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.480]   society. Anything that we can do to encourage that is good.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.000]   This is the question a lot of people will be interested in, and maybe you can't comment,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.200]   but is there any potential that eventually, through crypto or offshoring or some other option,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.800]   that somebody's ability to predict will somehow be able to get reflected back
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.920]   on them in some sort of monetary gain outside of the play money?
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.720]   Oh, on our site? I think that's—well, first of all, we are planning to do things like host
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   tournaments with real cash prizes. That's something that we are able to offer despite
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:59.120]   being a play money product. We originally started as a crypto idea before pivoting back to Web2.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.720]   That's funny. We're one of the first firms to pivot from Web3 back to Web2 for usability reasons.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.760]   But creating a real money crypto offering is something that's on our back burner and something
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.720]   that we're thinking about, that we're actively thinking about. It would probably be in the form
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.000]   of a separate product, though, rather than as an addition to our current offering.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.960]   I'm curious what the usability concern was there. Is it like connecting the MetaMask wallet
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.920]   to your account? Your current process is so easy. You can basically make a bet within
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.520]   30 minutes or 30 seconds of visiting the site. I'm curious what the concern was there with crypto.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.960]   I think there are several things. The first is just like onboarding.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.360]   Only a tiny chunk of the global population actually has created a MetaMask wallet or a
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.320]   Solana wallet or any of these things. The process of doing that and transferring tokens to the wallet
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.280]   is actually pretty cumbersome and not yet very easy. That's kind of a huge hurdle just to start
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.640]   with. Then you have to add in all of the other frictions associated with being a crypto platform.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:14.080]   It takes a while for transactions to be confirmed. If you're doing everything in a purely decentralized
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.880]   way, you will have to sign each transaction with your wallet, stuff like that. Each of those things
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.960]   is just like an additional hurdle that will prevent users from being able to bet and enjoy
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.240]   their experience on the platform. Not to mention transaction costs,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.040]   which would reduce liquidity. Yeah. That's a big one, too.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:39.920]   Speaking of reputation, one of the things that seems interesting to me, my prediction over the
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.080]   long term is that the reputation of the market creator will matter a lot because in your website,
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:53.040]   they're the ones who get to resolve questions or resolve markets. What is the equilibrium there?
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.760]   Is it just that there's going to be a few trusted market creators who people trust to
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:05.680]   adjudicate what happened? Or will anybody be able to create a big trusted market?
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.080]   I think it'll be a bimodal distribution where you'll see a few huge market creators that are
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.560]   high trust and have huge volumes across a lot of their markets. Then there'll be a very long
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.920]   tail of smaller individuals with less of a track record. Their markets will be participated on by
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.760]   people closer to them on the social graph, their friends or friends of friends and stuff like that.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.000]   Now, here's a question I've had for a while. Why don't companies who have
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:42.160]   a direct incentive to get the best possible information on themselves, on the factors
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.480]   affecting their business, why aren't they using internal prediction markets if this is the best
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.320]   way to aggregate information? This is a great question. First of all,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.520]   a lot of companies have tried using prediction markets internally, including Google, GM,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.680]   the CIA, and a bunch of other firms as well. But for the most part, you find that
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.920]   they will use it. People will talk about it for a bit. They will even praise the benefits of
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.600]   prediction markets, but ultimately, they'll abandon them. I think the main reason for that
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.560]   and a very Hansonian point is that people literally don't want to know the answers to
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:34.160]   a lot of questions. In a corporate context, that mostly manifests itself in the manager choosing a
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.720]   course or vision for their company and then not wanting to get negative feedback about that.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:47.040]   Even if the feedback is mostly positive, it still can seed doubt on the part of employees.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.160]   The introduction of a prediction market by itself might just lower the odds that that mission will
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.560]   be successful, even though one wouldn't think that just the addition of more information would
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   actually change the outcome. But I would say that that's the biggest point. It steps on
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.040]   management's toes, and they don't like that. Interesting. It's almost the opposite of his
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.800]   point about consultants. His point about consultants is that they basically put a
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   pretty face from Harvard. They allow you to say, "This highly credentialed person who talks well
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.160]   supports what I'm doing, so that's why I should go ahead and do it."
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.840]   Now, one question I've always said about this Hansonian view is, even if it's true,
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.720]   you would expect some firms to do the painful thing or some managers to do the painful thing.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.040]   You're a startup founder. You know that many of the most successful startup founders
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.520]   will go ahead and do something that is quite difficult that they don't want to do.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:48.720]   We would expect over the long run for the market to be dominated by players who have
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   done the thing that helps their company out of all the thousands of companies that are out there.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.080]   Do you think in a decade or two, all the best companies in the world will have internal
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.440]   prediction markets? Or is the force from managers against us so strong that that's not going to
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:10.160]   happen? I would say there are two parts. The first is a rational concern on the part of managers to
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.240]   not use prediction markets because it undercuts their mission. It's not merely an irrational quirk
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.160]   of human nature. Perhaps it is in general, but it's not an irrational quirk of the manager's
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:29.040]   part in choosing not to use them for a certain context. The second part is, I think the areas
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.080]   where prediction markets more clearly add value without distracting from the mission or hurting
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.160]   management are where they're used for their informational aspects or to do market research.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.760]   Questions where you need to survey, a broad survey of what consumer behavior will be,
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.360]   how our competitors will behave, that sort of thing. I think that's a much clearer example of
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:58.480]   where prediction markets can provide value in a corporate setting, which doesn't fall prey to most
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.800]   of these downsides. Then the question becomes, why hasn't that happened yet? I would say part
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:12.400]   of that is just a usability concern. It's actually very hard to create a product that's extremely
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:18.000]   simple and easy for all of your employees to use that doesn't require too much thought but can
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.880]   still yield reasonable results. I would say part of our goal with Manifold really is to bring the
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.480]   bar down lower such that more and more people can participate in prediction markets, and it'd be a
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.880]   pleasant, fun, and easy-to-use experience. Yeah, that it definitely is. I was about to suggest
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   maybe it would help Zuckerberg to know, maybe he gets subsidized a market to find out how many VR
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.040]   devices there will be in the world by 2030 to help him make his metaverse plans, but maybe he doesn't
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.400]   want to know that, or maybe at least he doesn't want that publicly known. One question I have is,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:05.360]   in what situations is it best to have a single person compound all the available knowledge,
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:12.400]   and in what cases is it best to decentralize the decision-making process by having a market?
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:18.320]   I would say that in general, if you're making a decision in the real world,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.640]   it's often very difficult to operationalize what the success criterion is down into one thing
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:33.360]   that the market can then measure and be used to act upon definitively. That's the biggest case for
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:40.720]   personal discretion or human involvement in decision-making. In general, I think prediction
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:48.400]   markets work best when people are creating markets on a variety of metrics and then using human
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.600]   intuition to figure out what the best course of action is to proceed using that information.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.800]   I'm curious, what is your opinion about insider trading in Congress, for example? I know this is
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.440]   like a big debate. Do you think it serves like a useful price discovery function or too much of a
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.880]   hazard of adverse selection? Kind of a tangential point, I'm just curious about your opinion.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.200]   Mm-hmm. I would say in general, my view of insider trading is, or I basically have Matt
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.120]   Levine's view, is that it should be viewed as a taking from shareholders rather than a fairness
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:28.560]   or equity type of discussion. I do think in general, insider trading obviously does benefit
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.640]   price efficiency, but there are other things that we care about. We also don't want, in general,
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.880]   our corporate shareholders to be profiting from certain types of information and all those.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:49.520]   In the case of congressional betting or insider trading by elected representatives, I think that's
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.520]   for the most part not cool. We would prefer for them to be compensated directly through salary
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.280]   or other things which are more open and transparent to the public rather than,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:10.480]   this is kind of a way of profiting or a roundabout way of corruption in some sense. You can make a
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.600]   deal with some company and then trade on that and instead of the money that never directly passes
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.720]   into your hands, but you're privy to this insider information and the net effect is equivalent to
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.040]   this practice, which we would not normally condone. Now, one place where I'm skeptical
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:34.080]   of prediction markets is when we're talking about questions that resolve over a long period of time
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:39.280]   and which there's no good base rate for, so the market hasn't really been trained on that kind
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.560]   of question. One example would be what are the odds of catastrophic AI by 2030, which I'm sure
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.800]   is a question on your website. I'm not sure how much credence I put into the prediction on this
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:59.520]   question. One, because I'm not sure why I would expect that much good information to be aggregated
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:06.800]   here in the first place. What is the information they're going off of? Second, I guess more
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:14.960]   important is why would somebody bet yes because the best case scenario if they bet yes is they die
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:20.160]   anyways, right? They have nothing to gain if catastrophic AI happens. In these kinds of
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.960]   scenarios, what do you think is the role of prediction markets? Do you have these kinds
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.720]   of concerns? What are your thoughts? Oh, I think, yeah, both of those concerns
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:33.840]   are very valid. I think part of this is just a fundamental human constraint. If things are very
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:40.080]   far in the future, we care about them less. That's true in prediction markets, but it's also true in
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.560]   every other domain as well and every other forecasting technique as well. The interest
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:53.920]   rate is a fact about human nature or discounting of the future is a fundamental facet of human
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.880]   nature. You can twiddle with the mechanism on the margins here or there, but I don't think it'll
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:06.000]   fundamentally change that. For your second point, though, your other point is very well taken too,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.360]   that you can't bet on an apocalypse. You're not going to be there to collect your winnings.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.040]   The money is worth less in that universe, so you should rationally bet against it.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.640]   Actually, so Brian Kaplan and Eliezer Rudowsky actually do have a bet on an AI apocalypse. The
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:32.480]   bet is about whether there will be catastrophic AI, I think by 2030 is the exact bet. Brian pays
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:40.000]   Eliezer now, and if by 2030 there hasn't been catastrophic AI, then Eliezer pays Brian the sum
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.480]   that Brian paid plus more based on the ratio of their bet, which I thought was an interesting idea.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.480]   Just going off this topic a little more, one of the things that Scott Alexander brought up in one
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.200]   of his blog posts is when you have these kinds of bets that resolve over the long term, it doesn't
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:03.040]   have to be as far-fetched as AGI. It could just be something like who's going to be president in
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:09.920]   2024. He pointed out that at least at the time that he wrote it, Dwayne Johnson had a 9% chance
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:15.120]   of being elected president, which seems high, except why would somebody get their manifold
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:21.040]   dollars held up in a question that won't resolve for four years or two years now?
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.640]   The ability of speculators to correct prices is diminished because they don't want their money
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:33.120]   to be held up in questions that won't resolve for a long time. How are you guys dealing with
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:39.280]   that kind of problem? I would say in general, the best way to tackle these long-term,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:45.120]   more speculative questions is to try to break them down and address the proxy variables that
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:52.000]   are most relevant to predicting their success in the future. Instead of asking, "Will the AI
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.760]   apocalypse happen in 2050?" you can ask, "Will OpenAI's GBT4 exceed this number on this benchmark,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.080]   et cetera?" Or similarly for The Rock, instead of asking, "Will The Rock be the president in 12
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.240]   years or whatever," you could ask, "What are his polling numbers today? What are his favorability
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:23.600]   ratings? Will he show interest in running as a politician, et cetera, et cetera?" Those are much
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:32.000]   more short-term questions which you can use to get a sense of the longer-term, more speculative
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.800]   questions that interest you. Tyler Cowen has this other criticism of prediction markets that,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.000]   "Listen, these prediction markets are tied to financial markets that you actually could bet on."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.040]   I don't know if you think somebody has a higher or lower odds of being president. Maybe that has
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:59.600]   effect on GDP or something, and that has effect on stock prices. Then he says, "Well, if you're
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:05.200]   so good at betting in prediction markets, why don't you just bet in the financial instrument
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.160]   that are linked to whatever question you're interested in?" Brian Kaplan's response to this
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.640]   is, "There's so many different things that can affect any given financial instrument that it's
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:23.440]   not easy to explain. Okay, because I think, A, about Dwayne Johnson becoming president,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:31.600]   I can invest in asset B." I feel like that defense of prediction markets is a criticism of your
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   response that you just gave where you're saying short-term prediction markets can substitute for
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:46.720]   your interest in long-term prediction markets. I would say yes and no. Asset prices of major
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.960]   financial commodities and equities and other instruments are affected by way more factors
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:58.160]   than another prediction market on a more isolated question on some proxy variable that you care
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.360]   about. The nice feature of prediction markets is that you really can isolate the particular risk
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.600]   that you care about. And even if it's just discussing one proxy variable that's related
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.120]   to the overall picture, you can still get a much better understanding of the thing that you care
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.880]   about by picking multiple well-targeted proxy variables and creating markets on those rather
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:27.600]   than oil prices, which tell you many things, too many things. Okay, so lay out your vision for me
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:34.720]   of 10, 20 years. Prediction markets are not only much more liquid, more people participate in them,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.680]   and everybody kind of knows what a prediction market is. So people understand what it means
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:47.600]   when you say Biden, I guess it wouldn't be Biden then, but whoever the president is passing this
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:55.040]   bill, one of the many things that would need to happen other than a constitutional change would
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:01.440]   be major advances to longevity research. Oh, yeah. So what would the world look like
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.240]   if people actually cared about prediction markets? And if it was like common knowledge,
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.040]   what the market thought about any given situation that was happening?
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.960]   Well, I would say, first of all, I would say that would probably be a much better world.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:25.840]   Across a wide variety of domains, I think it's better in nearly but not all cases when people
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:33.440]   are grounded in terms of facts and well-calibrated predictions instead of pure speculation or
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.720]   ideologically biased thinking. But more concretely, I can imagine a world where
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:49.360]   the average news article, blog post, CNN station, if that's still around in 10 or 20 years,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.320]   has an embedded prediction market on whichever topic that they're discussing. And it'll just
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:01.920]   allow people to immediately get a sense of what the most grounded or it'll immediately ground the
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.200]   opinions that people are hearing in fact and make it easier to have more productive conversations
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.640]   and ultimately allow them to better understand the world.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.960]   I hope that's the case. You know, there's a pessimistic take that people are not consuming
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:24.880]   politics to understand what's happening and that they'll almost resent you for presenting
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.560]   them with this kind of information. That's true. Certainly, I'm not
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:34.880]   implying that a large part or even like a majority of the consumption of political news
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.960]   is based on a desire for accurate information. I think that would be a very naive view of how
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:50.000]   humans operate. But at least a small part of that is. At least some portion of people's desire to
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.480]   consume news actually is to legitimately understand the world. And insofar as people
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:00.960]   are attempting to do that, prediction markets can help. I really hope so. And I think that actually
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:08.000]   could be true, which is very exciting. So one question I have is these trades that people do
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:18.400]   on your market, you know, 4% of what is traded or the traders winnings, they go to the market
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:25.600]   creator and 1% are just burned. Correct me if that's wrong. But that seems like a negative sum
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.600]   bet, which means that are you concerned that that would reduce liquidity because people
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:38.960]   have to get over a higher threshold of confidence before they're willing to bet on any given market?
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.320]   Yes. Yeah. Like your fees do impede the efficiency of the market in some sense.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:49.440]   You know, there are people who on the margins would trade if there were no fees, who don't when
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:56.720]   there are fees. That certainly is true. But part of the reason why we have fees is like to encourage
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.040]   things that we like. You know, we have a creator fee, the creator earns a commission on trades
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:07.120]   that incentivizes them to create and resolve more markets. We currently have a liquidity fee as well,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.600]   which feeds into the liquidity pool, which you can think of as subsidizing the entire market.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.440]   I'm curious, what is your background? So you know, one of your co-founders is your brother.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.240]   Do you guys have some sort of financial background or mathematical background? Because,
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:27.760]   you know, I was looking at your technical documentation. I'm not claiming to have
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.440]   understood most of it, but I saw the formulas that were there. I visually skimmed it.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:42.480]   How are you guys able to get into this field? So I guess I studied computer science in school.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   Then I went to work for SIG or Susquehanna. It's an options trading firm for a little bit. Then I
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:57.760]   left to go work for my friends, like RoboAdvisor startup, where I wrote their portfolio optimizing
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:05.280]   software. So I have some financial experience as well. And all three of us are technical,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:12.640]   and also have a previous background doing other entrepreneurial things as well, too. So we're
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.600]   kind of like full stack entrepreneurs, I guess you could say. Can you talk a little bit about
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.720]   your previous entrepreneurial experience? I think listeners might be interested.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:28.560]   Sure. So right before this, my brother and co-founder James and I were working on our
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.240]   app called Throne. It's a subscription group chat app for online creators. So people like you,
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.720]   or like Instagram creators, or DJs, or anyone who's built up an audience online,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:46.640]   the idea was that they can set up a private group chat with their audience where they're paying a
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:56.000]   subscription fee to join. And basically, the premise of our app is that we provide a much
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.720]   better chatting experience for larger groups. So it's designed to accommodate the creator's
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.920]   entire audience and make that a seamless experience. Yeah. I have a friend who has a
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:15.760]   popular fantasy football channel, and he has a very profitable Patreon, where basically from
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.680]   the point of the Patreon is it'll give you the link to the invite to the Discord,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:26.240]   which seems convoluted. And this product where you're just basically combining those two services,
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.680]   that seemed very useful. So what happened with that?
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.880]   It's still going slightly. Basically, we couldn't get the growth that we were hoping for.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:41.920]   The ultimate cause is it's kind of too late. The creator market is already saturated with all
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.800]   different sorts of tools. Most creators are already monetizing one way or another and aren't
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:54.240]   keen on monetizing using a new platform. So when it comes to the manifold markets,
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.280]   I mean, the idea for having prediction markets, even the idea of having prediction markets to
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.400]   play money, I believe has been around for a long time, right? What took so long for somebody to
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:11.200]   make a user experience that was so comfortable as yours? Or is there something else that prevented
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.920]   somebody from making a manifold market earlier? Yeah, I would say the other key piece of the
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:21.440]   puzzle that other people were missing is the idea of user resolved markets, which on the surface
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.640]   sounds a little bit crazy, that you just allow anyone to come and create a market on any question
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.600]   where they are also the judge of that question and can resolve it in any way that they want.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.360]   That obviously opens the door to fraud and abuse and people taking advantage of the system.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.400]   And the fact that there is a possibility of fraud basically has prevented other people from even
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.480]   exploring this option. Instead, they're opting for oracles or centralized authorities deciding
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:54.880]   the outcome of all markets. But of course, that severely limits the scalability and reach of a
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.360]   prediction market platform if users can't go on and create their own thing. So it's really
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:06.160]   realizing that user resolved markets actually can work that led us down this path. There is a small
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:12.080]   amount of fraud, but it's actually quite small and manageable. If you allow users to choose which
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:17.200]   markets to participate in, they, for the most part, are making pretty good decisions about where to
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.960]   allocate their time and money. There's this great essay called "UNIX is worse is better." I don't
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.840]   know if you've gotten a chance to look at that. The basic point the author makes is, if you ask,
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:35.360]   "Why has UNIX been so successful?" You can say, "Oh, some of the features and some of the design
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:43.680]   decisions are arbitrary. They're somewhat inoptimal in certain situations." It seems that
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:49.600]   maybe it was those bugs that actually allowed UNIX to be the kind of thing that can actually
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:56.160]   run on real computers. Maybe it's not optimal from the perspective of somebody who wants something
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.520]   super elegant and beautiful. Guren has a really good blog post about this, "Bitcoin is worse is
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:08.480]   better," where he makes the same point about Bitcoin. I'm not remembering the details right
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:14.400]   now, but some of the actual constants involving block size or whatever, they're pretty arbitrary.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.200]   But the fact that somebody just put out the arbitrary numbers meant that innovations that
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.360]   could have been around years before, in terms of cryptographic tools, actually got instantiated in
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.240]   a product like Bitcoin. It seems like you're taking a similar attitude towards prediction
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.720]   markets. Even if it's somewhat arbitrary to let users resolve markets, that's better than having
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.120]   some sort of Oracle structure, which is super convoluted and hard to use and may sound good
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:49.360]   in theory, but is impractical as something that people want to use. Yeah, that's exactly correct.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   I think the most important thing, not just for us and not just for prediction markets,
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:02.320]   but for creating a usable platform, is making sure that the key mechanism is something simple
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:08.560]   and easy to understand, more so than handling every possible edge case perfectly. As long as
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:17.040]   the core experience is extremely simple and easy to use and user-friendly, that matters much more
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:24.400]   than the 1% of cases. I'm curious if this is something you learned at your previous startup.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.800]   Did you guys make this mistake and now you've learned to avoid it?
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   Curious how you came to that realization. I don't know. I don't know that I can think
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:42.240]   of a good example that's directly relevant. Although we did simplicity of both the business
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:48.720]   model and our user interface for our previous chat app were big considerations. A subscription
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.520]   model is the minimum viable business for a creator to support themselves in a real way
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:01.520]   over time. That might be one manifestation of this principle in action, but I don't know.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:07.440]   Okay. One concern somebody could have about manifold markets is you said you're giving
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:15.040]   out $1,000 manifold. Somebody could just maybe even make a bot that... I'm not giving anybody
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:23.280]   ideas, but just create 1,000 different accounts, make different trades on all of them or make a
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.080]   sequence of different trades on all of them. In one of them, they just make a series of the best
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.560]   trades that anybody has ever made on the platform, and now they're on the top of the leaderboard.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.840]   It's certainly true that if you're giving away free money, that's not an economically sound
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:44.160]   mechanism. We currently do do some things to prevent abuse and bot behavior. I'm not going
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.680]   to tell you what those things are. If we end up open sourcing our code, though, the cat will be
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:55.600]   out of the bag. You can see for yourself what abuse practices we have in place. I would say
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:02.960]   that we're not necessarily committed to maintaining our free giveaway or free signup bonus
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:11.120]   indefinitely. That's definitely partially a growth and just starting off thing. In the beginning,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:20.720]   most of our users have been very well behaved and haven't abused this system. If manifold becomes a
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.840]   key nexus for people trying to weigh in on the future, we may have to be more strict with our
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.040]   policies. It kind of reminds me of the PayPal story where they were giving $10, $20 bonuses
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.200]   for people for signing up. It basically meant they got exponential growth, but they were losing money
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.640]   faster. I guess in this case, you're not losing real money. I don't know. Maybe you're diluting
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:48.240]   the reputational value that the best people in the leaderboard have, at least for now, maybe.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.440]   Yeah. I would say one of the other things that we're interested in, or the concept of a global
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:59.200]   leaderboard becomes less important over time the larger our site gets. A lot of the markets that
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.880]   people bet on are personal markets or markets between friends. What you as an individual care
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:11.920]   about in terms of ranking who the top traders or predictors are really is not all of the markets
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.840]   that we have on our platform, but the subset of markets that are of interest to you. We actually
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:23.680]   just removed, or we used to have this feature called communities where you could create a
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:28.720]   community centered around a collection of different markets and we would show the leaderboard just for
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:36.240]   those markets. That's a way of judging, or it's a way of assessing the ability and skill of
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.440]   predictors within some particular domain that you care about rather than globally. We'll probably
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.360]   bring that back in some capacity in the future. Can you give an example of that? I guess something
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.320]   like that. Yeah. One thing you might care about is who is the best, like Russia, Ukraine, who is the
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:36:02.080]   best geopolitical and war predictor. One way to assess that would just be to hand pick a few
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:10.560]   markets about the invasion and the subsequent course of events during the war, and then just
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.640]   see how much profit people have made within those markets. I think that'll actually give you a
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:22.560]   reasonable estimate of who the top predictors are there. Versus just a global thing. For a while,
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:34.400]   one of our top markets on our site was about whether this stray cat would allow this random
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:40.720]   human to pet it. Totally random stuff like that. If you're trying to assess who the best geopolitical
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.440]   thinkers are, who the best economic thinkers are, you may not care about the stray cat. But a lot
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:52.320]   of people really do care about the stray cat in other contexts. It's a fine balance to strike.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:37:00.560]   Another interesting part of your platform is people can buy more play money. I guess the
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:11.840]   concern is even within these subdomains where people are being compared, the actual proficiency
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.920]   of a person could be distorted by the fact that somebody else could just buy more manifold
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:24.240]   dollars and as a result, may be able to have a higher profit. I guess you can measure it maybe by
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   percentage gain on the total amount of money or something. But yeah, I'm curious on your
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:38.720]   thoughts about this. In general, I'm pretty pro-efficient markets. If you think about what's
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.920]   happening when a whale comes in and buys up a huge amount of money and bets it on the wrong side,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.160]   what they're essentially doing is just providing a huge subsidy and bonus to the people who are
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:54.960]   actually correct. Markets are a mechanism which is the most efficient way of solving the whale
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.280]   problem. If you are too much money and you are not very smart and are very confident
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.720]   in your views of the world, the markets have a very fast and easy solution for you
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:14.800]   to obviate that problem where you will no longer have so much capital to throw about.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:21.600]   There's a direct analogy to this actually, as I'm sure you're aware, in real markets where a pension
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.360]   fund or some other big fund needs to rebalance its books or something. It'll need to just dump a
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:35.760]   bunch of stock and liquidity providers can make money off the big trades that these big funds need
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:48.400]   to make. I guess then you wouldn't be interested in schemes like, I guess, some decaying value of
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:56.080]   the manifold dollars that you can buy in one account. The marginal manifold dollar costs more
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:01.840]   than the one before it. You think this would inhibit price discovery, right?
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.520]   Yeah. Although I have toyed with some other interesting monetary schemes in the past.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:15.440]   One idea I had is introducing demerge or basically negative interest rates on cash balances.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:24.560]   You could imagine a world where your purchasing power erodes over time. If you made a bunch of
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.760]   really good predictions this year, it's not necessarily the case that you should be rewarded
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:37.840]   by having all of that cash forever. Maybe some portion of those uninvested cash balances erodes
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.760]   by 20% a year or something like that. I think it's a really cool idea in principle, but in practice,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:49.840]   users absolutely hate losing money for any reason at all. It's kind of like a non-starter.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:57.360]   But it's interesting to think about. Sorry, I'm not sure I understood. If the
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.200]   re-explanation is unnecessary, then we could just cut it out at the final. But
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.800]   just for my benefit, can you clarify what you were saying?
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:11.680]   Sure. So the idea is at certain times, you'll have just uninvested cash that's sitting in
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:21.360]   your account. The idea is to just charge you for that. So charge a sales tax at the rate of 20% a
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:30.800]   year. But maybe once per day at midnight, you lose whatever amount that is, a small fraction of your
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.320]   uninvested cash. Okay. So one thing that makes
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:42.560]   financial markets really efficient is you have these big firms that are putting up large amounts
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:48.160]   of capital to recruit the top talent in the world because it's worth it for them. They're running
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:56.400]   these supercomputer simulations. It's expensive to do all this stuff. But it's worth it if you're
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:02.960]   getting like 0.001% of a trillion dollar market. In the case where you have play money, what is
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:09.040]   the incentive for... I get that people who are hobbyists or are in other words, motivated to do
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:17.280]   this might choose to do it and choose to engage in it themselves. What would incentivize somebody to
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:25.600]   put in the kind of effort it takes to have efficient financial markets and cost and time and so on?
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.160]   Yeah. So I would say that in general, people are willing to put a lot of time and effort
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:36.320]   into virtual economies, irrespective of financial gains. If you look at things like World of
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:42.560]   Warcraft or earlier like Second Life, which has virtual real estate, people are willing to invest
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:49.520]   the equivalent of hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in this game world. I feel
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:56.240]   people's ability to drill in and focus and work on things that are of interest to them
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.800]   is just like a very, very powerful force, even if it's not directly tied to a financial payout.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.040]   So what is the point by which Manifold's own internal decision making will be informed by
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.760]   prediction markets involving, I don't know, the firm's predictions about the firm?
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.200]   Oh, it is already. We actively create markets on all sorts of things which are
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.640]   of interest to us. Most recently, we created a market on whether we would be able to complete
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.400]   our fundraising round by the end of April. That was a cool market. The market believed in us for
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:42.000]   the most part. I don't think we fell lower than like 85% somewhere around there. But we actually
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.440]   do try to dog food our markets as much as possible. We have a new market now on whether we'll be able
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:53.840]   to onboard three employees, I think, before the end of June, something like that. That's a number
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   that we try to keep our eyes on. I guess probably the first big case where the market actually
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:10.320]   substantively informed our decision about how to act as a company was an early market we created
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:18.800]   on whether we should try to monetize by selling the play money. Initially, we weren't sure whether
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.640]   that would be a good thing to do at all, whether users would hate it or it would seem scammy or
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:29.520]   whatever. But we created a prediction market on this subject, I think, phrased in conditional
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.240]   terms that if we did introduce this, if we introduced the feature, would we keep it for
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:41.280]   some period of time? And the market seemed to think that we would. So that actually was a factor
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.720]   which played into our decision. Yeah, I'm asking these questions in probably the wrong order. So
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.880]   this is really one of the initial questions I should ask you. But talk me through the timeline
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:57.920]   of developing Manifold Market. So how long ago was it launched? And what you said in the beginning,
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:03.520]   it was supposed to be based on crypto. When did you guys change your mind? What is the timeline
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:10.480]   here? Yeah, so this company began long, long ago, way back in December of 2020.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.800]   In a god's far away? Yeah. Yeah, it's a very new company.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:24.560]   Basically decided to ditch crypto after maybe like a week, a week's worth of speculation and
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:32.640]   research. Part of it is that we just thought we could build a PlayMoney prototype very quickly,
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.120]   and we could just test that and see what the experience is like. And if we wanted to,
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.600]   we could continue further on into crypto. And partially is just based off reading about the
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:50.720]   regulatory nightmare that is prediction markets and crypto. And partially is the usability
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:57.840]   concerns with crypto. But basically, we all like in the month of December, we came up with the
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:07.280]   original idea. We applied and received the ACX grant from Scott Alexander. And we timed it such
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:13.920]   that right when the grant announcement came out, we had a working prototype of our prediction
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:20.160]   market system ready to go. And then we were able to onboard a bunch of users from the ACX community
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:26.400]   immediately, which formed the base of our platform. And since then, we've been growing and
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:35.120]   responding to user concerns and improving our site to be ever more usable.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.040]   I know you guys use something called a dynamic pair of mutual betting system. I looked into the
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:48.960]   paper. I think I understood like maybe a quarter of it. So was it like an experience of learning
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.280]   as you went or is it something you guys are already familiar with?
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:58.560]   No, definitely the former. I had heard of Uniswap and some other mechanisms. I had heard of like
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.800]   Hanson's log market scoring rule and some other things, but I didn't actually delve into the
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:08.400]   details until quite recently. Originally, we actually came up with the idea for dynamic pair
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.400]   of mutual by ourselves, thinking about it from first principles. And then we later, I went back
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.920]   through the literature and read a bunch of papers and realized that it was called dynamic pair of
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:26.240]   mutual and found a more elegant implementation of a dynamic pair of mutual system based on a
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.200]   quadratic cost function that I hadn't considered previously.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.240]   Yeah, you'll have to talk me through it over dinner the next time.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:41.440]   Yeah. So you mentioned that you are hiring. Maybe there are some people in my audience who might be
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:46.880]   interested. So you want to talk about what kinds of roles you're interested in hiring for, other
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.280]   kinds of things that might be involved in recruiting?
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:54.960]   Sure. Yeah. Yeah. So we, right now we're looking to onboard a few people to our team. We're looking
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:01.520]   for full stack developers who preferably have front end, a lot of front end and potentially
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:07.680]   react experience. We're looking for a community manager. That would be someone to help us manage
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:13.920]   our discord, help write blog posts, help with our sub stack, help reach out to people on social media
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.800]   and organize online events. Someone with no previous background in doing this at a startup
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   would be great, but we're open to people from other backgrounds as well. And then we're looking
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:33.760]   for a head of growth or someone who has experience scaling up an early to mid stage startup.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:46.080]   We're looking for someone who's helped take the company from one to $10 million annual recurring
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:51.040]   revenue or around like 50,000 monthly active users, something somewhere in that neighborhood.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.400]   But yeah, if you are interested in Prediction Markets and Manifold in particular, I encourage
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:03.360]   you to reach out to us. You can either email us at jobs@manifold.markets or me personally,
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.600]   steven@manifold.markets. Excellent. Excellent. And any other topics involved with
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:15.200]   Prediction Markets or Manifold that we have not discussed yet that you want to touch on?
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.120]   One of the things that we've seen from launching this site is that users have come up with all
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.400]   sorts of like exotic ways to use Prediction Markets that we hadn't previously considered.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:31.760]   So part of that or like Prediction Markets obviously can be used on predicting the future,
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:37.680]   basic yes or no questions. But some exotic things you can do are like getting users to help like
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:44.640]   research topics for you. You can create a market on, phrase these types of things in a market-based
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:49.200]   way and then people can propose certain answers and other users can bet on them. That's an
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:54.080]   interesting feature of our site. People have hacked our platform to do things like create lotteries,
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:59.760]   to play games. We did Manifold Plays Wordle where we created a series of Prediction Markets on
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:06.240]   which word we should guess next. There are just like all sorts of other things,
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.360]   non-prediction type things you can do with this market mechanism, which are really cool.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.320]   That is an interesting idea. I'm not sure how that was conducted, but like I could imagine
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:23.760]   researchers saying, "Will my conclusion on a paper of this question be X or Y?"
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:28.880]   And then to move the market, somebody would not only have to bet, but also like maybe put in the
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.120]   comment section the data that makes them think it's X or Y, which can be the basis of the paper.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.840]   So you're basically getting research assistance. Yeah, that is very interesting.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:44.400]   Cool. Yeah. I would say relatedly, one of the new types of markets we've introduced
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:50.000]   is this concept of a free response market. So in addition to a yes or no market where you're
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.080]   just betting on something will happen, we have this idea of a free response market where you ask
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.200]   a broad open-ended question and people can submit an answer. And when they're submitting an answer,
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:05.440]   they're also placing a bet on that answer and other users can bid up different answers
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:13.600]   that the market creator will then choose. And that really opens up the space of possibilities
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:20.320]   towards allowing a much wider array of questions. Steven, thanks so much for coming on the podcast.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:28.640]   That's manifold.markets, right? Any other places or links that people should be aware of?
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.920]   I think that's the big one, manifold.markets. You can join right now and we'll give you
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:39.040]   $1,000 manifold dollars to bet on any market you like or create your own.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:52.320]   Excellent. Thanks so much, Steven. All right. Thank you.
