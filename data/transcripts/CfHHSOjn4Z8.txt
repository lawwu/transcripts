[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820]   - Maybe we could talk about bromocriptine a little bit,
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.860]   and I'm not encouraging people to run out
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.100]   and take bromocriptine.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.980]   Bromocriptine, as you mentioned, is a dopamine agonist,
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.900]   relatively short acting.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.940]   - Yeah, four or five hours, six hours.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.340]   - So kicks in about 90 minutes after,
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.380]   as I recall you saying, I've never taken it.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.380]   How do people feel when they're on bromocriptine?
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.660]   I mean, when I hear dopamine agonist,
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.020]   I mean, there are a lot of illicit drugs
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.740]   like cocaine, methamphetamine that are increased dopamine,
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.580]   but then again, chocolate,
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.100]   sex and food increased dopamine,
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.900]   but the kinetics, the time course and the levels
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.340]   are different for each of those things.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.780]   Dopamine, of course, being a currency of motivation
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.000]   and reward, not directly related to any one compound.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.460]   But I would think that based on the data
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460]   you just described that,
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.100]   and given the fact that there are a number of people
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.220]   out there with challenges in working memory,
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.900]   attention, task switching, et cetera,
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.700]   that there would be a strong interest
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.060]   on the part of the pharmaceutical companies at least,
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.780]   and certainly the general public,
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.260]   in things like bromocriptine to increase dopamine,
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.880]   to increase working memory, given it is our superpower.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.580]   - Yeah, I mean, one of the most disappointing things to me
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.060]   in my career has been that pharmaceutical companies
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.220]   have not picked up on this idea
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.020]   that we could improve cognition
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.000]   and very specifically improve kind of process
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.640]   with very specific neuromodulators.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.760]   The discovery that depletion of dopamine
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.860]   and not other transmitters impairs working memory
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.660]   was made in 1979.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.020]   When I heard Pat Gomer, he used to talk about this
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.860]   as a resident, I was just amazed
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.220]   that there could be a single transmitter
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.400]   can change a single behavior.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.540]   I was seeing very complicated behavioral deficits
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.980]   and it just seemed impossible to me
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.700]   that there could be such a tight link
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.820]   between a single neuromodulator
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.080]   and a single cognitive process
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.320]   and just opened the door for me
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.160]   that this really could be an incredibly beneficial therapy
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.920]   for anyone with executive function or frontal lobe function.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.760]   So, but unfortunately there's never been
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.500]   a pharmaceutical company that's tried to develop a drug
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.080]   for improving cognition to this day.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.120]   - And they, I mean, it's crazy for several reasons.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.480]   One is that the data are clearly there.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.440]   Two, these drugs are already established.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.040]   It's not like they have to go through safety trials again,
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.080]   that's already been done.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.560]   But mostly because regardless of whether one is a fan
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.720]   of the pharmaceutical industry or hates it,
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.520]   the pharmaceutical industry in principle
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.760]   can make a ton of money doing this.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.600]   So I would think that they'd be heavily incentivized
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.420]   to do it.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.240]   So why have they turned a blind eye on this?
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.080]   - I'm not sure.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.880]   I mean, when I realized that I could test these drugs
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.720]   in healthy individuals, that they were,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.520]   if I gave them in low enough doses, they were safe.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.040]   And I had so much experience of them in patients
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.940]   that I felt comfortable doing it.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.960]   Then I started asking pharmaceutical companies,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.120]   do you want to get involved here?
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.080]   We can, we can, this should be done.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.720]   I can't do this by myself.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.280]   We need to have real trials and real studies
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.640]   of how this will help, you know?
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.800]   And just, it was, you know, their eyes would always cross
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.440]   and never, never got any, any sort of traction.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.680]   It always went back to sort of disease.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.880]   You know, what, what disease are you curing?
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.580]   You know, what, what's the market for it?
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.880]   Is it a Parkinson's disease thing?
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.600]   Is it Alzheimer's disease thing?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.880]   And this has been a general problem with neurology.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.480]   It's very disease centric.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.080]   It's always sort of, and it's always focused on, you know,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.020]   how can we develop a treatment for Alzheimer's
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.400]   or traumatic brain injury or stroke,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.160]   as opposed to how can we develop a treatment
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.440]   for working memory dysfunction,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.560]   which is a problem across diseases.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.520]   So the answer to your earlier question
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.080]   is these drugs are very safe.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   They, we give them in such low doses to healthy individuals.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.000]   They don't even know, they can't even tell the difference
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.520]   between the placebo and the drug.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.360]   - Really?
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.680]   - They don't even know which one they're on.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.920]   - So they're not buzzing, thinking like,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.840]   "Oh, this feels good, and my working memory is better."
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.680]   - They have no idea.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.000]   They don't even know their working memory is better.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.560]   And so we show them that their working memory is better.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.400]   - Love it.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.220]   - Yeah.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.480]   - So they're truly blind to what's going on.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.040]   Bromocriptine is but one of the dopamine agonists.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.320]   Can think of a few other, cabergoline,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.460]   like other things like that.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.380]   Do any of these dopamine agonists
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.000]   exert this impact on working memory,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.500]   or is it, does it vary by drug
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.740]   because different dopamine agonists
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.020]   sort of hit different receptor pathways
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.060]   and things like that?
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.780]   - Yeah, no, it's not specifically the drug.
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.700]   I mean, the reason for bromocriptine
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.960]   is that it's the oldest,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.720]   and it's the one I was most comfortable with.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.380]   I had to be comfortable with it clinically
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.620]   before I'd give it to undergraduates at Penn or Berkeley.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.620]   So there's nothing special, but other agonists work similarly.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.820]   There's a drug that's developed,
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.260]   which is a COMPT inhibitor,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.420]   which actually inhibits this enzyme
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.420]   that we're talking about.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.420]   And that also will improve, will have the same function.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.500]   There's been some future work that norepinephrine
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.200]   also seems to be helpful with working memory.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   It's not as, maybe not as potent as the dopaminergic.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.260]   And that's the point I want to make.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.740]   Another disappointing thing about this whole field
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.740]   with the pharmacology of cognition,
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.980]   I wrote a paper as a resident.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.060]   Sometimes you're tending to say,
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.980]   "Hey, can you write this review paper for us?"
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.660]   And I wrote one as a resident
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.020]   called "The Pharmacology of Cognition,"
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.780]   where I just looked at all the animal literature
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.100]   on giving neuromodulators,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.540]   acetylcholine, bromodotamine or whatever.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.740]   And there was a lot of animal literature
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.140]   sort of supporting that this would work in humans,
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.340]   but what was more striking to me
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.300]   was that it wasn't always just a single neurotransmitter.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.620]   There were studies where you'd give dopamine
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.740]   and it wouldn't do anything.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.620]   You'd give acetylcholine and it wouldn't do anything.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.980]   But if you gave a low dose of both,
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.940]   it would be really effective.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.760]   So these neurotransmitter systems don't act in isolation.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.380]   So we need to also study sort of how the combinations work.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.460]   And that's where another,
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.340]   where the pharmaceutical companies have the infrastructure
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.540]   to do these kinds of studies.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.140]   It's very hard to do in a single lab
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.220]   to do multiple drugs at one time,
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.820]   and then try and determine all the different interactions.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.220]   - Maybe we could talk about a couple of other drugs
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.140]   that are legal and have FDA approval,
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.660]   are known to be safe in the right context
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.020]   that it seems would fit the bill here
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.060]   for improving working memory.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.060]   One is Welbutrin.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.500]   Bupropiron, I can never pronounce that.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.900]   As far as I know, it's a epinephrine
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.620]   or norepinephrine agonist.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.700]   You just mentioned that increasing epinephrine
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.980]   may have a positive impact on working memory
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.060]   and to some extent, a dopamine agonist.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.580]   Is there any evidence that Welbutrin
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.460]   can improve working memory?
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.380]   - Yeah, anything that boosts norepinephrine can do it.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.700]   The one that we've used, that's most used is Guanfacine,
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.560]   which is actually a blood pressure medication.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.500]   So that's starting to gain some traction.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.780]   In fact, I think there was a study with COVID,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.180]   with brain fog for COVID,
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.780]   showing that improved symptoms with it.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.980]   So there's actually some trials now
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.860]   that are looking at Guanfacine.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.340]   And so I would say anything that boosts norepinephrine
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.340]   would be helpful.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.100]   But then again, I don't wanna leave out
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.260]   the other transmitters.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.700]   Increasing serotonin, increasing acetylcholine
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.580]   boosts other cognitive processes.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.600]   And then in a way, they can help working memory.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.200]   We talked about working memory being this foundation.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.920]   Well, if you give acetylcholine and it kinda boosts memory,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.440]   well, that can indirectly help your executive function.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.840]   Or if you give a drug that improves your focus,
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.560]   then that can indirectly help working memory.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.040]   So what I'm really pushing for is not just a single,
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.560]   it's gonna be one drug, it's gonna be a cocktail.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.820]   And we have to not only figure out what the cocktail is,
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.880]   but also figure out who we're giving it to,

[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.160]   of their own neurochemistry.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.200]   When we get to a point where we'll know,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.440]   we can map out sort of everyone's dopamine,
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.120]   norepinephrine, serotonin levels,
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.960]   then we'll make real progress in helping them.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.840]   Because right now, I sort of say with my students,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.520]   what we're doing is just like cutting open the skull
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.400]   and just sort of pouring it onto the brain.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.080]   - We're not actually doing that.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.920]   - We're not actually doing it, but it seems that way.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.820]   The precision is not there yet.
