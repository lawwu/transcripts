[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   I love Gabor Matei's definition of trauma.
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.880]   It's not what happens to you, it's what happens inside of you, right?
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.240]   So to me there's an inherent relationality there where events that get processed, not
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.760]   any event, events with high emotionality, let's say, that get processed in aloneness
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.440]   become traumatic.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.040]   And I think that's where it gets linked to responsibility.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.840]   So this is actually what my TED talk was about and why repair is so important.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.840]   Who said this?
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   Ronald Fairbairn years ago, that for kids it is better to be a sinner in a world ruled
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.800]   by God than to live in a world ruled by the devil.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.920]   I think it explains almost everything about child development right there.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.560]   Going back to goodness also, your parent just screamed at you.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.560]   And by the way, your parent, I scream at my kids, everyone's gonna scream at their kids,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.560]   it's gonna happen, okay?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560]   That's just the event.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.480]   The event's not gonna have the impact.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.480]   What is happening for a kid?
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.440]   Well, we know kids are oriented by attachment.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.760]   They literally need us to survive.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.160]   They could not survive on their own.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.840]   And so what do you do when the person you're dependent on for safety becomes the source
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.280]   of danger and threat?
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.720]   That's very confusing for a child in that moment.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.480]   So they're super hyper aroused, they're in this state of terror.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.320]   And then usually after in my house too, I just yell at my kid, they're kind of alone
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.400]   in their room.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.240]   I'm alone in the kitchen or wherever, meanwhile spinning, 'cause I'm like I'm such a bad parent.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240]   Like I'm probably, you know.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.140]   But meanwhile, because I'm so lost in my own guilt, I might not be going to my kid.
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.960]   And so what happens for my kid if I don't repair after I scream at them or one of these
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.480]   events, right?
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.460]   Well, a kid cannot say to themselves, "My parent just had a bad day."
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.040]   Then the badness is in my parent.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.200]   My leader, I'm young now, right, like I don't understand nuance.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.280]   My leader can't be bad.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.000]   So I must take on the badness, at least then I have control.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.080]   So kids, after they're kind of yelled at, in the absence of repair, they really only
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.000]   have two options for how to regulate and feel safe again.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   They can self-blame, "It's all my fault," which is why I feel like most adults when
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.920]   they have a hard time, they tell themselves like, "It's my fault.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   I'm not good enough."
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.360]   It's like the legacy of that story from childhood.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.560]   Or they use self-doubt.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   Maybe that didn't happen.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   Maybe I overreacted.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.720]   Maybe I can't trust myself.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.080]   Again, it leads to adults who basically say like, "Did I overreact?"
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.800]   Or, "Let me call five friends.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.520]   Let me see if they think what my boyfriend did was a big deal," because they can't
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   trust themselves.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   And so trauma, what I want every parent to know is they'll say, "I left my kid alone
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.000]   and I didn't pick them up at the soccer field.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.280]   Is that going to traumatize them?"
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.820]   And I'll say, "Well, that's just the event.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.800]   Did you say to them, 'Hey, that probably felt scary?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   What was that like?
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.840]   Oh, you're right, like you were alone.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.080]   Now all of a sudden, next to the event that was scary is my story and my connection.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.160]   It got processed in a safe connection.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.480]   It didn't get processed in aloneness."
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.760]   And that's a massive, massive difference.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.480]   In this scenario, you are describing the parent who yelled goes to the child, having been
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.680]   that child and perhaps also having been that parent.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.320]   How do we deal with the fact that sometimes, you know, we don't want to be around the
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.040]   person that yelled at us?
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.960]   It hurts to receive the care or there's like a textured landscape as opposed to a smooth
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.600]   landscape there, like, okay, now you're ready for everything to be peaceful.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.920]   I'm still with my feelings.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.960]   I guess that's where the "I believe you" comes in and that's where the sorting it through
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   process begins.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   Is that right?
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   Well, I think it's like what version of a parent comes back.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.340]   The first thing we have to do in a repair process is actually repair with ourselves
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.280]   as a parent, really.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   Because if you haven't repaired with yourself, which to me is kind of separating your identity
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.360]   again from your behavior, like, okay, Becky, I'll use myself as an example, I'm a good
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.800]   parent who just screamed at her son, like, "I did not mess up forever."
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.240]   And you see when you try to repair with yourself, those two things get collapsed.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.520]   I'm like, "I messed him up forever.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   I'm a monster.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   Wait."
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.840]   Like, I'm a good parent who did something I'm not proud of.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.080]   You can't repair with someone until you've repaired with yourself.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.080]   They feel it from you.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.840]   They actually â€“ it usually is like then you're asking for them.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.680]   I'll be like, "It's okay, right?
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   Like you forgive me, right?"
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   That's not a repair.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.920]   That's like using your child to try to do something we just have to do on our own or
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.920]   with other adults.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.240]   But if I've repaired with myself, I'm going to show up in a different way.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.240]   Might I have a feisty kid?
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   I might.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   He's like, "I don't care.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240]   It's not better."
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   That's okay.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   I'm not repairing to get something from my child.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.000]   I'm repairing to give an experience to them.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.880]   So we can also get creative.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880]   You know, your kid is older.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   You text them.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   You slip a door under the note.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   You say, "Okay.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   I just have to say this one thing."
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.280]   To me, this line really matters to like snatch that self-blame out of a kid's body.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.240]   It's just like, "I'm sorry I yelled.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.560]   It is â€“ it's never your fault when I yell."
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   And it's not.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.800]   And people who argue like our ability to regulate our emotions predated our child's existence
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   like that.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   You know?
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   Like they had something.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.240]   They did something.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.720]   And we felt frustrated.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.320]   But that's very different than yelling, right?
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.000]   And saying that to your kid is so important.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.640]   Meanwhile, the next day you might say, "By the way, let's really figure out how to get
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.200]   out the door in a smoother way."
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.800]   You know, you could work on whatever they need to work on.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.880]   But the reason I think most kids end up rejecting parents' apologies is it's not really repair.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.800]   We're asking our kid for permission to be okay again.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.840]   Or a repair sounds like, "Hey, I'm sorry I yelled.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.400]   But, you know, like if you just got ready in time, it wouldn't have happened."
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.600]   Or we say, "I'm sorry you felt that way.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.200]   I'm sorry you felt that way."
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.160]   Those are not â€“ like none of those are actually repairs.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.240]   And if that's what a kid's been used to, they're going to keep a parent more at bay.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.440]   So is it safe to say that we can always come back to making the kid feel real and safe?
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.120]   I believe you as a great place to start.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.880]   And the reason I keep coming back to these simple things is that â€“ simple but very,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.680]   very potent by the way â€“ is that in the real world landscape of parenting, family
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   and life, things are happening really fast.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.040]   And it's very dynamic.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   And it's multifaceted.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.720]   I mean, we haven't even talked yet about how â€“ when there's two parents, like the
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.280]   one that didn't yell.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.120]   When there's multiple siblings, when â€“ I mean, there's â€“ you know, human dynamics
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.160]   on a one â€“ in an other landscape is hard enough.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.480]   And then when you start introducing the real world landscape, things happen fast.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.780]   So having something that people can reach to really quickly, what I call in the landscape
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.440]   of stress modulation, which is something that I'm more familiar with from my lab's work
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.200]   is, you know, real-time tools.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   Real-time tools.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.920]   Like we're all at our best after meditation, vacation, massage and a good night's sleep.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.840]   But what about real-time tools when everything's â€“ everything's hectic?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.640]   So what does a really good apology look like in the real world?
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:13.800]   I mean, a really good apology in the ideal world of Instagram is, "Yeah, I believe
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   you.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.760]   I'm so sorry," with no buts, no this and that.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.320]   But a real apology sometimes is as you're boarding a plane or when there's a bunch
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.760]   of other things that are going on and you haven't even dealt with those yet.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.240]   Or when you're on your way to an event or you â€“ yeah, okay, so you get it.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.520]   What does a really good internal landscape for apology look like?
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.120]   Like how can we touch into where we need to be?
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.600]   And then what are the words that even if we have to try again later and again and again
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.320]   later with that person, in this case kid, but person more generally, what's the like
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.920]   go-to solid apology?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   Right.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.080]   So, yeah, I think you are never going to go wrong saying, "I believe you," to your
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   kid.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080]   Like obviously not if you say it randomly.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.520]   But if they're really upset, "You yelled at me," "I believe you," like if that's
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.880]   all you can remember, you're crushing it.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.560]   I think a realistic repair, you have to do something for yourself.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.400]   And like to me it can be a very simple mantra.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.640]   Like to me, "I'm a good parent who is having a hard time," is the one I use, honestly,
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.320]   over and over.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.600]   And after I yell at my kid before â€“ I'll like go to the bathroom sometimes and I'll
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.480]   say that to myself, "Becky, like I'm a good parent having a hard time."
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.720]   And I'll kind of say it as many times as I need until I really do feel something like
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.400]   shift a little in my body.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.880]   Because, again, I think that phrase separates what I did from who I am, right?
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.560]   And then to me a realistic apology, it could be super simple.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.160]   If you remember nothing else, it could just be like, "I'm sorry I yelled."
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.000]   That's great.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.400]   If you want to â€“ if you're like, "I'm feeling it, Becky.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.220]   Give me that next step," you know, "I'm sorry I yelled."
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:56.900]   Just like you, I'm working on managing my emotions and, you know, next time even when
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.100]   I'm frustrated I'm going to try to stay calm.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.860]   Something about the next time, you know, if you want to throw in that it's not your
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.860]   fault.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.220]   Kids â€“ it seems an odd thing because parents are like, "Why?
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.820]   Do kids assume it's their fault?"
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.620]   It is their default position.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.740]   And so it's never a bad thing to throw in.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.500]   But honestly, just simply, "Hey, I'm sorry I yelled," that actually gives them that
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   realness.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:27.220]   Because without saying anything more, you're saying that thing you think happened did happen.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.220]   So that's powerful.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.540]   Thank you for tuning in to the Huberman Lab Clips channel.
