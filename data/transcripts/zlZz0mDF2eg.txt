[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   -
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:18.180]   - So as a philosopher turned engineer,
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.920]   I have, for better or for worse,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.760]   been obsessed with two questions my whole life.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.260]   What is a thing and why does it exist?
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.680]   So we're here talking about AI in the Fortune 500,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.660]   and the future of AI commerce.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.960]   So let's ask a hopefully straightforward question.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.160]   What is a store?
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.000]   A hundred years ago, a store looked like this,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.860]   something we don't really recognize today.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.800]   Inventory was in the back of a shop.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.760]   You had to talk to a clerk, tell them what you wanted.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.200]   They went and then fetched it and brought it to you.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.320]   It wasn't until the 1950s and '60s with information systems
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.360]   that we were able to actually scale the concept of a store.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.380]   And you saw big box retailers like Walmart and Costco emerge.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.260]   The inventory moved from the back to the front,
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.820]   and you now had this concept of browsing.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.760]   With the internet, we took that store and then we put it online.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.260]   And so we took the scale of merchandise
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.700]   and matched it with the scale of distribution.
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.340]   You can now browse anywhere in the world 24 hours a day.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.360]   A lot of people think that websites are dead.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.240]   But a shocking number of people still shop online.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.260]   Walmart had almost 500 million shoppers last month.
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.900]   Home Depot had 170 million shoppers in its online store last month.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.300]   But the thing that we sacrificed was we got a sea of sameness.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.360]   Can you really tell the difference here between Adidas, Reebok, Brooks?
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.380]   And so maybe we can start piecing this together to answer this question:
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.260]   What is a store?
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.340]   A store is a location and a protocol that facilitates transactions.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.260]   You have merchants that want to sell something, buyers that want to buy something,
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.280]   and then a system to facilitate that interaction.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.400]   So great, now we can start asking the question:
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.840]   What happens to the store with AI?
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.060]   If e-commerce digitized the merchandise and the distribution,
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.560]   AI digitizes the participants and their interactions.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.160]   We go from static websites to merchant agents.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.040]   We go from consumers browsing to consumer agents.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.060]   And we go from low-level payment infrastructure to higher-level intent infrastructure.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.960]   But we still have the same goal.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960]   That's not changing.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.920]   We're still trying to get to a transaction.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.820]   And so what is this actually going to look and feel like, you know, qualitatively?
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.800]   That's something a new generation that we spend a lot of time obsessing over.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.820]   How will a new generation of consumer, both human and agentic, interact with a new generation
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.840]   of interface that is dynamic and real-time and generative, built on a new generation of infrastructure
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.740]   that needs to serve those new needs?
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:23.760]   So we see two possible futures.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.840]   You'll have either AI agents that go to websites, or you'll have agents that have programmatic
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.560]   access.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.600]   Option one, when they go to websites, will look something like this.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.760]   Maybe you're in ChatGPT, you want a new TV.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.780]   Maybe you're into gaming, so you say, "Hey, I want a new TV."
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.740]   Your agent goes to a new type of website optimized for that agent that can richly express your intent.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.360]   It dynamically cuts the product catalog and the brand style guidelines and returns that content
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.780]   directly into the chat interface that you're operating in.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.540]   When you want to buy, that agent then can go back to the website and go through the entire
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.300]   checkout process for you.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.020]   It gets interesting when you think about programmatic access in this world.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.980]   So maybe you have the same starting place, you're in Chat, but instead of actually going
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.520]   to a website, you have an MCP server or an API that's programmatically accessing every merchant
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.540]   on the internet.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.140]   That API endpoint can then reason over the API call and return back a rich set of UI elements
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.020]   generated on the fly.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.720]   Similarly, when you're looking to buy, instead of going to a website, it's just going to hit
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.480]   an API endpoint.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.640]   And so if that's the future, how do we get from today, this sort of static world of consumers
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.500]   browsing and websites, to this future world of agentic interactions between buyers and users?
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.360]   So let's start with the goal.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.400]   The goal is a transaction.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.060]   We want high-quality conversion with users that hopefully are happy, hopefully they don't
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.800]   return the item that they get.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:10.100]   And so in code, a payment is represented with a payment intent when a user clicks a buy button.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.480]   That intent then goes through a set of transformations through the checkout process.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.340]   results in success and money movement.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.440]   Our first challenge in this agentic world is, what if software is the one that's clicking
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.200]   this button?
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.060]   So if you use operator today, it'll mostly error out on these e-commerce websites.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.100]   And so there's two solutions that people have come up with.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.100]   One is the solution that exists today.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.060]   This is kind of the Stripe SDK solution.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.920]   So instead of checking out with a merchant, you check out with ChatGPT or the software provider.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.800]   That software provider then spins up a virtual card and buys the item on behalf of you using
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.720]   that new card.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.780]   We think the more elegant solution is what one of our partners Visa is working on, which is delegated
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.720]   authentication.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.180]   The agent is able to use your actual credit card and go through the checkout flow for you.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.500]   So that solves transactions, but it doesn't get us very far.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.300]   What if we can move up a level of abstraction?
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.960]   What if we can actually go to the buying and selling intent and the preferences?
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:32.440]   So a buyer intent today is expressed and it's inferred via keyword searches, click data,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.360]   and site metrics.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.880]   In the agentic future, we think that this is going to be explicitly captured rather than inferred.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.280]   Conversation data is rich with user intent.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.800]   And you can actually just ask a user agent what it's trying to do.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.280]   You don't have to statistically infer it.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.480]   This gives us our second challenge.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.400]   If we have fuzzy intent, often people are just searching for, hey, I want a pair of running
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.800]   shoes.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.580]   How do we actually get that to the skew level item, which is the inventory representation
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.940]   of that product?
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.680]   Today the main solution is to force it explicitly.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.280]   So you actually have to provide a product detail page URL to an agent in order to buy.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.580]   We think there's something very interesting that's emerging with the merchants that we're working
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.080]   with, which is users that come from an AI channel are much higher conversion, much higher dollar
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.320]   value, and much higher lifetime value.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.480]   That opens up a whole new set of possibilities for how to rethink the cost structure of fulfillment.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480]   a product detail page.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.680]   Maybe it doesn't actually matter if the user gets the wrong thing if it's easy to return
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.280]   and they're high value.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.960]   On the seller side, that selling intent, as I mentioned, is really represented with a product
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   detail page.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   We all know these.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   They're pretty static.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.680]   There's just a buy button, a price.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.400]   Maybe there's some discounts, maybe there's some bundles.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.080]   In the future, this is going to be very dynamic.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:11.500]   We think merchants will need to show real-time product availability, they'll have contextual
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:18.560]   pricing and discount that they can serve to a user in line, and the ability to infinitely
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.960]   bundle products across multiple merchants.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.840]   This starts to get complicated, so then we encounter our third challenge.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.180]   How do we know if a specific item is actually available across all the thousands of stores
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.180]   that exist?
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:39.200]   So we have a user that wants to buy something, and now we actually have to go find the store.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.620]   There's two solutions today for this that we think are suboptimal.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.260]   One is to use existing product feed infrastructure.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.440]   So a lot of folks use this with Google.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.720]   That requires chat products to individually work with every single merchant to get this
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.280]   data.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.680]   The other alternative is you scrape product data from every website on the internet.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.080]   We've done that.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.340]   We think it's suboptimal.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.920]   It's both repetitive.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.480]   You have to do it a bunch.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.280]   And then you end up clogging websites with bot traffic.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.820]   The more elegant long-term solution that we're working on is to actually create a unified API
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.680]   to access product data across every merchant.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.400]   You can think of this like a plaid, but for product data.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:31.580]   So instead of aggregating over financial institutions, you can aggregate over merchants.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.100]   And then the last piece at this layer is how do we represent buyer and seller preferences?
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.340]   Today, this is one-sided and very narrow.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.200]   You have siloed user accounts, transaction data.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.560]   You have limited LLM memory.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.040]   And then businesses don't share really anything about their intent beyond quarterly and annual
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.200]   reporting.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.740]   In the future, we think this will be two-sided and very expansive.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.020]   They'll have rich context on users, not just across the purchase, but across every aspect
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.980]   of their life.
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:09.620]   And businesses will be able to express their real-time strategic goals.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.420]   What's low on inventory?
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.560]   What users do they care about?
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.660]   What strategic change has happened with something like tariffs?
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.240]   The challenges here are very wide open.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.480]   These are market design challenges.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.880]   You have the challenges that preferences are very complex.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.420]   They change over time.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.380]   They often conflict between buyers and sellers.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.460]   And there's a disincentive to honestly report your preferences.
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:42.300]   The current solution is you naively trust the information that you're given.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.960]   Other folks have talked about prompt injection or manipulation of LLMs.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.260]   And so that's kind of the world that we live in.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.740]   When I worked at Bridgewater on our trading system and market systems, the world of finance
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:01.420]   saw this with third-party institutions and market makers that manage those differences between
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.340]   buyers and sellers.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.240]   We think that's the world that this needs to move to.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   And so great.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.500]   We've gotten a little bit further, but nothing is really agentic yet.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.580]   You sort of need this last piece.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.380]   This is the frontier, which is you need to add intelligence to the decision-making at each
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.100]   of those components.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:28.900]   And so consumers and merchants need not just intents and preferences, but they need intelligence
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.980]   that can reason over them and negotiate them.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:39.120]   And then on the infrastructure side, you need to move from just market-making to actual coordination
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.840]   and reasoning over these participants.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.740]   The logic for generating in real-time the interfaces that each of these people need.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.740]   Okay.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.620]   So let's see how this is working in real life.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:59.040]   I think a lot of people look at the Fortune 500 and they think, oh, these are big, old,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.600]   slow-moving companies.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.800]   But what people fail to realize is they had to survive the last 100 and 150 years of dramatic
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.020]   technological and societal shifts.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.380]   And so we find that they're actually quite forward-thinking in terms of this challenge.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.840]   And so if you take an example of Samsung, they started 100, 150 years ago as a fish merchant
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.720]   in Korea with 20 or 30 employees.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.320]   It wasn't until the '70s that they started selling televisions, and it isn't really until
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.760]   the '90s that they became what we know them today, this technological behemoth.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.620]   And they're at the forefront now of thinking, how does the brand of Samsung evolve in the world
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.940]   of AI?
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.660]   And how are they going to bridge e-commerce to this agentic future?
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:58.960]   So the first step is we create an API and MCP server for any chat client to use.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.800]   A lot of Fortune 500 companies have complex product systems.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.200]   Samsung, for example, has 10 different verticals, each with their own inventory representations
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:17.360]   of products, and so we do the work of attracting that into a consistent API with cohesive endpoints
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.760]   that will work across any merchant.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.740]   The second step is then to connect that product data with other data sources at the company.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.100]   This is the first step in constructing that seller intent.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.880]   The natural starting place with what we're doing is let's just connect the brand and design
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:44.940]   system that the company has to actually wrap the products in how they want to be represented.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:51.160]   So we're moving away from these carousel and static representations of products.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:57.000]   That third step then feeds into a container for experimentation.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.240]   And so we make an AI subdomain that allows for rapid experimentation of generative interfaces
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:11.860]   that can ingest both the product and brand data to serve customers.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.820]   And so we're also experimenting with what does conversation look like when it's not just a bullet
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:23.620]   point and text list but actual images and products and content.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.180]   And then the last piece is handling agentic transactions.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:34.620]   This is actually enabling the payment flow to work on this new surface for bot traffic, which
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.880]   is a real inversion of the typical posture of a .com website.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:46.060]   And the reason that brands are excited about this is again because users from AI chat, while
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.760]   they might be small, are much higher intent, they're deeper in the funnel, and they convert
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.120]   much better.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.520]   And so we think every retail brand, every merchant needs to adopt this posture.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:08.140]   And with any big change, we think the right approach is to start with the question of what and how.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.080]   We don't think stores go away.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.340]   We just think that they evolve.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.920]   We think they return to the original form that they were in.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.200]   And we think that form is actually a conversation.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   Thank you.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:33.520]   All right, we do have time for questions, if anybody wants to chat for a bit.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.880]   And if not, yeah, go ahead.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.240]   Can you use the microphone over here, please?
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   Thank you.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.380]   I'm not that tall.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.920]   I don't know if you noticed that, but we are talking about machine customers, maybe, just
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.180]   like there is a book called "Where Machine Becomes."
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.180]   From customers.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.180]   Yes, from the Gartner.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.740]   So I work in a bank, and now it's very usable, what you said.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:06.180]   But what is your projection in terms of how this is going to be, just like the break even,
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.180]   right?
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.880]   When it's going to start seeing this in our daily basis?
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.000]   Because today is only--
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.680]   Yeah, it's happening fast.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:22.920]   I mean, even if you look at a product like ChatGPT, it is starting to bring shopping experiences
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.240]   into the product.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.680]   The thing that's missing is you don't actually have the full journey within that application
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680]   yet.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   And so you still link out to a website.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:38.180]   And that's the thing that we're interested in exploring, which is, will you still link
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.500]   out to a website?
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.580]   I don't think that goes away immediately.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.680]   And then every brand that we talk to, there's a strong desire to own a Surface in this new
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   world.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.240]   So we think you can start with a web-like Surface that is built in a way that's transportable
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   so that when these chat products want to bring shopping into the application, that you can
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.640]   actually just bring that data and components directly in.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.480]   You don't actually need to re-architect and rebuild.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.020]   And so we're really excited about that.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.720]   It's almost like this inversion where instead of going to the website, the website is going
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.960]   to go into a thousand different places.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.580]   Are credit cards the right payment mechanism for the agentic economy, or do we need something
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.580]   new?
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:30.500]   I didn't want to open that can of worms in the talk.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:39.560]   I think conceptually, there's a strong argument for stable coins and crypto to be the native payment
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:46.860]   rail for AI, mostly because the agents can actually live within the wallet.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.480]   I think practically, consumers use credit cards.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.780]   And so it's the most likely bridge to get to that world.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.800]   And then there's a third alternative, which is the agent itself just owns a perpetual credit
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.200]   card and you top it up, which is interesting.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   Thank you.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:10.500]   There's an interesting parallel in places like China and Brazil where they have the form
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   of super apps where everything happens in that one place.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.280]   Do you see Claude and ChatGPT trying to become the super app and shopping just takes place entirely
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.420]   over that platform?
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.500]   I think that's their goal.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:33.240]   And then it becomes this question of how do the rest of us, how do merchants have control
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.120]   in that environment?
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.840]   And I think the one thing that model providers are very open to and what's different than the
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.800]   internet is, is the goal is to get the user to the right outcome.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:52.180]   And so they have a, interestingly, they have a different incentive than tech companies in
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.180]   the past.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.060]   And so we think there's actually kind of like a nice alignment between the goals of a merchant
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.980]   and the goals of these chat products.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.980]   And do you foresee any form of revenue share happening there?
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.980]   Definitely.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.300]   I think we don't think it's going to be advertising.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:16.800]   It'll probably look a little bit more like either affiliate revenue or, you know, if you provide
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.900]   high quality data and you can be attributed to a good answer, I think there'll be some portion
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.480]   of that that these model providers will give back to merchants.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.480]   Great.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   Adam, thank you so much.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.480]   That was a great talk.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.480]   Thank you.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   Thank you.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.480]   Thank you.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.660]   We'll see you next time.
