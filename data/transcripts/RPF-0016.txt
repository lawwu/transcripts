[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Toyota's Black Friday deals are too good for just one day.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.960]   So right now, every day is Black Friday at your Toyota dealer.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.600]   Hurry in and get a low APR or a great lease on our most popular models,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.560]   like the powerful Camry, sporty RAV4, tough Tacoma, rugged Tundra,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.760]   and even the RAV4 Prime with its astonishing range.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.600]   But don't wait.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.760]   Black Friday every day and Cyber Monday.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.160]   We make it easy.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.960]   Toyota.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   Let's go places.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   Radical Personal Finance, episode 16.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:55.120]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.520]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets, and today is Wednesday, July 9, 2014.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.920]   Today's topic is, what advice would I have given to the 18-year-old me,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800]   knowing what I now know?
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.520]   I've got one, two, three, 13 different pieces of advice here.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520]   Stay with us if you're interested.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.920]   So today was a busy day for me as I record this.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.120]   It's late in the evening, and hopefully we'll get this out as soon as possible.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.320]   But usually I try to record the show in the morning.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.120]   But today was a busy day, had a lot of appointments,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.720]   and wasn't able to get to the show.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.920]   So was-- and I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to do the show on today.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400]   There are lots of meaty topics that I could dig into,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.320]   but yesterday was pretty deep, pretty meaty.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.120]   Hopefully you all enjoyed it.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.720]   Hopefully you were able to dig through it and gain some good tax planning
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   advice that would be helpful, or at least the basics of understanding
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.120]   how to approach tax planning advice that would be helpful for you
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.120]   in the future.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.520]   But those types of shows take a long time to prepare.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.720]   I mean, what is that?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.320]   Yesterday's show was like an hour and 40 minutes, I think.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.120]   And the preparation time of getting my notes lined up,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.820]   getting an outline, trying to think, is this going to make sense?
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.920]   Pretty challenging.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.720]   So today I certainly didn't have the time to do a long show like that.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.320]   And was considering what I wanted to do.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.820]   Had a couple of show topics, and got on Twitter this morning,
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.920]   and started talking and mentioning and saying,
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.720]   what do you want to ask a financial planner?
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.120]   And so I got a couple of interesting responses back,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.320]   and really enjoyed that.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   But one of the questions that I thought was super fun came on Twitter.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.920]   The Twitter handle for the person is @RobbyPC30.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320]   I guess a man named Robby.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.120]   And Robby, thanks for the question.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.820]   He reached out to me, and his tweet back to me-- and by the way,
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.420]   if you're interested in being a part of the Twitter conversation,
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.420]   the Twitter handle for the show is @RadicalPF.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.920]   So @RadicalPF, P-F for personal finance.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   And then my personal Twitter handle is @JoshuaSheets,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.120]   Sheets with an A, S-H-E-A-T-S.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.620]   So @JoshuaSheets.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.920]   Follow us either way.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   Both of them are me.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.420]   I just imagine that the show one will be show topics, and me,
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.520]   you'll get a lot of other stuff as well if you're interested.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.820]   So feel free to follow either place.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.320]   So Robby tweets back to me and says, knowing what you know today,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.020]   what financial advice would you have given your 18-year-old self?
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.920]   Doesn't just have to be financial.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.320]   So a topic like that.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.420]   How's that for a setup?
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.420]   How's that for a fun topic for somebody to go back and think?
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.220]   What would you have told your 18-year-old self?
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.220]   And as it happens, the interesting thing is that I have
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.420]   wanted to create an essay written basically entitled
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.320]   "Advice for a High School Junior,"
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.520]   because I've got some ideas on what a high school junior should do.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.820]   I'm not going to go through that today,
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.220]   but I've got some specific topics and some specific financial ideas
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.920]   that I think would be interesting for a high school junior to pursue.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.520]   And although I could do that, I'm not going to focus on that.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.420]   But I had prepared some of that stuff in an essay in the past,
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.820]   but I struggled to write well.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.620]   Speaking, I've learned that there's actually a learning style.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.620]   I don't remember the name for it,
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.120]   but there's a learning style I think is called a verbal learner.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   And I actually learn well by speaking.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.520]   And so it's one of the reasons why I'm doing a podcast and not writing essays,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.620]   but I learn really well by speaking.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.320]   And so it's a lot easier for me to sit down and say,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.120]   "What would I tell an 18-year-old me?"
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.720]   So I've got 13 things here that I would tell an 18-year-old me,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   and they are all related to finances,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   but there's not an IRA or the instruction to really save money anywhere here.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.220]   And the reason for that is because I think,
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.620]   you know, one of the things I've learned is that the technical stuff,
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.320]   it's important.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   And as you can see, we're going deep into the technical knowledge.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.220]   But does that stuff really make a difference?
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.520]   It does, but it doesn't make nearly as big of a difference as some other things.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.420]   So today's show is going to be light, fun, and fast.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.420]   We're going to talk through Joshua's 13 pieces of advice for the 18-year-old self.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.020]   And we'll see how it goes.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.620]   So number one, Joshua, don't be scared of people.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.820]   Or Robbie, don't be scared of people.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.520]   Or whomever.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.220]   If I were talking to an 18-year-old me, I would say,
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.820]   "Don't be scared of people.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.220]   Everyone else is just about like you."
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.820]   And this one was a tough lesson for me.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.420]   Because, you know, we all want to be liked.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.520]   We all want to be accepted to some degree.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.320]   And so we wind up trying to please people.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.020]   And when we're trying to please people, we wind up,
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.720]   I don't know, I think we wind up with a lot of fear.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.620]   Where does this come from?
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.620]   I don't know.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.320]   Sometimes I wonder about the way that our social structure works.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.420]   I wonder about school.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.520]   It seems to me like the social environment that we're raised in,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.520]   specifically speaking to my experience in the United States,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.020]   is, you know, it starts out good.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.720]   It's pretty easy when you're a little kid.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.320]   Gets pretty awful in middle school and high school.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.020]   And then it gets better as you go on, whether college and into the work world.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.520]   And if you think about all of the social pressure that comes at people,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.420]   the cliques, the groups, the peer pressure that comes,
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.920]   you know, it seems like elementary school,
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.420]   the early years of elementary school,
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.820]   the way our society is structured are pretty low-key and pretty easy.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.720]   By the way, we're on the topic.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.220]   This has never made sense to me.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.020]   So I'll share it with you.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.220]   And if you can tell me why it's like this and why we continue this system,
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.020]   you let me know.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.720]   But we start off in elementary school.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.220]   And we start off in elementary school, and it's pretty good.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.520]   You know, kindergarten's pretty fun.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.420]   First grade, pretty fun.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.720]   Second grade, pretty fun.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.920]   Somewhere towards that later part of elementary school or middle school,
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   it seems like the social dynamic changes.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   And it seems like if you're a middle school kid,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.020]   you're well acquainted with the idea of cliques and groups and the cool kids
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.020]   and the not-so-cool kids.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.320]   And you're well acquainted with where you fit in that social structure.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.420]   And then in high school, does it get worse or better?
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.920]   I don't know.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.120]   It's pretty bad for some people and pretty great for others.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.220]   So if you were a socially successful person,
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.720]   high school is probably pretty great.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.520]   And if you're not an unsuccessful person socially, not very popular,
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.320]   high school may be pretty tough.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   And then it seemed to me, when I went to college,
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.520]   it seemed like in college you had this first opportunity for people
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.220]   to finally be who they wanted to be and kind of live how they wanted to live.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.820]   And it seems like in college, when you're not put together
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.920]   in such a crazy environment like middle school and high school were,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   that you can kind of finally find your group.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.520]   And you can find out, wow, there's other people just like me.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.920]   Then you get to adulthood.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.620]   And in adulthood, you have complete freedom of choice.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.020]   So you have a complete freedom of choice with who to hang out with,
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.820]   who to be with, who to work with.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.520]   So school seems like this crazy artificial environment
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.420]   where you're kind of pushed into this forced socialization,
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.420]   if you can call it that.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.820]   And again, some people really have a great time in school.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.420]   Some people don't.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.120]   That was probably pretty middle of the road.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.820]   I didn't have a horrible time, but it also wasn't the best years of my life.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.420]   So it's this totally artificial environment.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.820]   And unlike being an adult where you get to choose who you're with,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.320]   choose who you hang out with, choose who you work with,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   which by the way, we all have a choice in who we work with,
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.920]   no matter how difficult the situation, you don't get that choice.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.620]   You're kind of forced.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.420]   Parents and the school and the government says,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.820]   you've got to be in this environment.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.020]   As an adult, you get to change your circumstances.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.620]   You get to learn.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.920]   And I feel like I'm just now learning.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.720]   I'm just now learning really not to be scared of people.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.620]   And it sounds silly and hopefully that's not too, I don't know,
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.420]   namby-pamby, even that, look at that, socialization.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.820]   Hopefully that's not too crazy to admit it,
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.220]   but it seems like everyone is scared of other people.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.220]   And whether that's you're trying to reach out to somebody to sell somebody
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.220]   on your new product or your new idea, you're scared what people will think,
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.920]   you're scared what people will say.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.620]   I mean, just don't be scared of people.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.420]   And the thing I've learned doing financial planning,
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.520]   which has been so interesting, and I don't know if I could,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.120]   I probably could have learned it in another way,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.820]   but I learned it doing financial planning,
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.620]   is that when you sit down and you talk with people about their goals
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.820]   and their dreams every day, you quickly find that everyone
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.620]   has just about the same goals and dreams.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.820]   It's remarkable when you start talking to people.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.520]   And whether that's the things like, well, if you don't own a house,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.820]   many people want to own a house.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.620]   If you don't have kids, many people want to have kids.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.520]   If you're not married, many people want to get married.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.920]   These are kind of common goals.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.020]   If people want to get a promotion at work, they want to make more money.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.820]   But then there are the bigger picture goals.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.920]   And who was it?
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.520]   I think Zig Ziglar.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.620]   I used to love listening to Zig Ziglar,
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.520]   which incidentally, Zig Ziglar was actually my first podcast.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.920]   I learned podcasting, I started listening to podcasts back in 2007
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.720]   when I found the Zig Ziglar, I don't even remember what the name of it was.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.020]   I haven't listened to it in a long time,
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.220]   but it was like inspiring others or something like that podcast.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.920]   And it was his company started releasing some of Zig's motivational materials
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.220]   online for free.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.020]   And that opened my eyes to the world of podcasting,
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.120]   which was for me an amazing experience.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.420]   Because since then, I've consumed a lot of podcasts
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.620]   and now I'm trying to contribute to it.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.020]   But I owe a debt of gratitude to Zig for a lot of things.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.220]   But I used to listen to Zig Ziglar seminars,
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.320]   which I highly recommend.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.620]   If you can find them, go look on eBay, you can probably find them.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.920]   But I used to listen to all of his seminars
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.020]   and Zig would say that basically everybody wants just about the same things.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.720]   And I think it was eight things.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.220]   He would say that people want to be happy,
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.820]   everyone wants to be happy,
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.420]   everyone wants to be healthy,
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.520]   everybody wants to be at least reasonably prosperous,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   everybody wants to be secure,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.420]   everybody wants to have friends,
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.420]   everybody wants to have peace of mind,
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.120]   everybody wants to have good family relationships,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.920]   and everybody wants to have hope,
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.720]   hope that the future is going to be better than the past.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.320]   Those were his eight categories.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.720]   I don't know if he made them up or if he learned them or what,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.420]   but those have stuck with me because I heard him say that so many times.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.820]   Everybody wants to be happy, healthy,
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.620]   reasonably prosperous, secure, have friends,
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.320]   peace of mind, good family relationships,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.220]   and hope that the future is going to be better than the past.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.320]   And so incidentally, look on iTunes.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.820]   What do you find with all these podcasts?
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.520]   There's a podcast on happiness, there's a podcast on health.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.020]   I'm creating a podcast on how to be reasonably prosperous.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.020]   There are podcasts on security,
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.420]   although security branches, you know,
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.420]   connects in my mind to financial planning in a large degree,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:36.120]   but although not, you know, security may be things like faith,
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.720]   eternal security, those types of things,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.620]   just this sense of security.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.720]   Everybody wants to have friends,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.220]   so there's podcasts on communication, on leadership,
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.120]   peace of mind, good family relationships,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.520]   there's marriage podcasts, and then there's hope.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.320]   Those are kind of the inspirational podcasts,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   and that kind of cuts across so many different categories.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.020]   But everybody wants the same thing.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.420]   And so for some reason, I don't know,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.020]   I just feel like I spend a lot of my life being scared of people,
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.120]   not for anything specific.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.320]   No one's ever hurt me. I'm a pretty big guy.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.920]   I've never been in a fight.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.020]   But so there's just kind of this idea
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.920]   that we're scared of what our parents are going to think.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.520]   You know, if we follow our dreams,
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.220]   if we drop out of college, if we go to college,
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.020]   we're scared of what, and this affects every area of life,
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.220]   we're just kind of scared of what people will think.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.820]   And so I'm pretty pleased, you know, I think I've learned this,
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.020]   but you know, I've still got a ways to learn.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.320]   Frankly, it's still, it's scary for me to do a podcast
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.720]   because you lose your anonymity,
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.220]   and now you're pushed out there on the front lines,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.620]   kind of telling your ideas, and you're on the record.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.020]   So now somebody can come, and just like I do to other people,
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.820]   somebody can come, take my words, and take issue with them,
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.320]   and so that's scary.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.720]   But I would just say, don't be scared of other people.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.520]   Everyone else is just about like you.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   And once you realize that, at least for me,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.820]   I found that there was an incredible freedom in that idea.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.320]   That's number one.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.420]   Number two, give up on impressing other people.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.820]   And I still struggle sometimes with how to balance this one.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.520]   And there's kind of this fight, this war,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.620]   this struggle between not just trying to impress other people,
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.620]   but then not necessarily trying to cut against other people,
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:24.520]   and not trying to needlessly offend.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.020]   I think about this in the area of dress.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.820]   Should you dress to impress other people?
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.420]   No.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.820]   But then again, is there validity in the ideas of dress for success?
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.620]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.320]   The way that you dress affects how people perceive you.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.420]   Should you try to look great for other people?
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.120]   Well, not necessarily to impress them,
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.620]   but then again, should you try to look great?
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.720]   I think you should.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.420]   So I'm not sure how to temper this one,
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.020]   but basically the idea is many of us kind of struggle.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.220]   We want to impress people.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.920]   But the thing is that if you go on,
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.220]   if I try to be impressive, and I try to sound impressive,
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.320]   and I try to speak about, look how impressive I am,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.120]   you'd turn me off in a minute.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.420]   You'd say, this guy's a dumb-dumb.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.720]   He's full of himself.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.620]   It's all about him.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.320]   It's completely arrogant, and I'm just done with it.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.920]   The best way to impress other people is to be impressed by them.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.620]   The best way to be admired is to admire other people.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.120]   The best way to be liked is to like other people.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.820]   The best way to be respected is to respect other people.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.620]   I mean, this is the way the world works.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.420]   And so as a young person, we're so concerned,
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.920]   kind of connecting through with being scared of people,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.820]   we're so concerned with impressing people.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.320]   And then it seems as time goes on, at least I've learned,
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.020]   no one really cares that much.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:52.620]   If you look at the people that are probably most admired in our society,
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.620]   they're usually a little bit unconventional.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.920]   I always think of rock stars.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.620]   The rock stars, we pay them lots of money,
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.520]   and they're really unconventional.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.620]   They're always looking to get attention.
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.320]   But they don't get attention by fitting in.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.020]   They get attention by being different.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.220]   And millions of people, for a well-respected rock star,
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.520]   will spend all of their time and all their money
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.520]   just simply admiring this person.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.020]   But it's completely different.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.520]   It's a free thinker, and people are drawn to that.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.720]   People are drawn to--
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.320]   the weird thing is people are drawn to being unconventional.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.920]   Unconventional.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.320]   Chris Guillebeau, my favorite essay--
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.420]   I've mentioned on the show before,
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.320]   one of my favorite financial planning essays
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.020]   that I would encourage people to read
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.220]   is his essay from years ago when he first got online.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.320]   He wrote an essay called, "Would You Rather Drive an SUV
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.820]   or Visit 100 Countries?"
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.920]   And basically the gist of it is that you have a choice.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.520]   It will cost you the same amount of money
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.120]   to buy an SUV as it will to visit 100 countries.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.620]   And if you look at that, most people just automatically
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.120]   buy the SUV, but yet I admire someone
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.620]   who's been to 100 countries.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.420]   To me, that's far more interesting,
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.420]   but it's the atypical choice.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.220]   And if you just simply give up on impressing other people
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.420]   and live according to the way that you want to live,
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.620]   it seems like, strangely, that's actually
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.320]   what impresses other people.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.720]   So give up on impressing other people by trying to fit in.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.320]   More financial mistakes are made this way than anything else.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.020]   And the weird thing is that you'll spend all the money--
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.420]   you'll spend all your money trying to impress other people,
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.620]   and they're not impressed.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.820]   But if you forget about doing that,
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.020]   people will often be impressed by you,
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.220]   no matter how much money you have.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.220]   I've never met Chris.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.420]   I hear he's a great guy.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.520]   I mean, he seems just like a really awesome guy.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.220]   I read a couple of his books, and I've
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.320]   read his blog for years.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.420]   But frankly, he's kind of a nerdy guy.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.320]   And he's kind of this real soft-spoken, real gentle,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.420]   nerdy guy.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.420]   And best of my knowledge, I don't think he owns a car.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.420]   He lives in an apartment in Portland or Seattle
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.620]   or something like that.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.920]   Not necessarily-- I mean, does he have money?
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.220]   I don't know.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.320]   I assume he does.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.020]   I hope he does.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.820]   He seems like he's got an awesome business,
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.120]   got some really cool products.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.520]   I hope he has a lot of money.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.420]   But the value is that he didn't set out for that.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.120]   And so the money is almost unnecessary.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.220]   If you don't own a car, you don't need to bother with it.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.020]   He's impressive, because he went to every country in the world
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.920]   by the time he's 35 and started something called the World
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.820]   Domination Summit.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.720]   How does it get better than that?
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.120]   Consider-- one of my other favorite online guys
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.420]   I really enjoy reading is a guy named Benny Lewis.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.220]   And he writes a blog called "Fluent in Three Months."
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.720]   If you're interested in languages, check it out.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.920]   Highly recommended.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.020]   But Benny Lewis, when he turned 21 years old,
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.320]   if I remember his story correctly,
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.620]   he only spoke English.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.920]   And then since then, he's gone on
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.920]   to learn a dozen or two languages
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.820]   that he speaks with varying degrees of fluency.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:54.220]   And every three months, he embarks on another language
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.620]   learning mission.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.020]   Again, kind of a nerdy guy, but what a cool story.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.420]   He lives on the road, travels to a new country every three
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.820]   months, it seems like, and has this awesome internet business
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.620]   just based upon what he's interested in.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.720]   But if you go out and try to impress somebody down
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.420]   at the club-- I live in West Palm Beach,
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.720]   and you go down to Miami.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.620]   Now if I'm going to go impress somebody at the club,
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.320]   I'm going to buy a fancy-- I don't even
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.020]   know the right lingo for that world--
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.520]   I'm going to buy a fancy car, and I'm
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.020]   going to pull up and live the Miami lifestyle.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.520]   Not that impressive.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.220]   So I think just stop trying to impress people,
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:33.320]   and really focus on just being you.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.660]   And the people who are interested in what you're doing
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.420]   will be drawn to you, and they'll be impressed by you.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.380]   I'm interested in languages, so I'm impressed by Benny Lewis.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.720]   But someone who's not interested, I don't care.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.740]   No big deal.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.780]   Let them go on their way.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.100]   I'm impressed by him.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.500]   I'm impressed by Chris Gillibook.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.020]   I admire what he's done.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.400]   Let someone else go on their way.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.300]   I think it's awesome.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.220]   But you don't need to worry about impressing other people.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:56.900]   Do what you want.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.260]   They'll be impressed if they want to be.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.060]   Number three, don't be scared to fail.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:08.140]   In our society, Western society, it's almost impossible to fail.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.100]   Take the risk.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.620]   What are you going to lose?
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.580]   And here's what I mean.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.340]   Again, speaking to primarily, I would
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.980]   assume, a US-American or at least a Western audience,
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.900]   in the Western society, failure has a very low cost.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.420]   There are almost no actual consequences to failing.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.900]   Now, in other parts of the world, that's not true.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.100]   You may lose your life if you fail in some place.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.320]   And there are certain things.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.660]   If you are practicing some extreme sport
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.980]   and you fail at that, you may die.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.420]   But I'm just talking about the things that most of us
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.060]   are scared of.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.140]   How in this country-- how is it possible to fail?
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:43.820]   Think about this.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.820]   What is the risk?
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.060]   You want to take a big trip.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.280]   You want to start a business.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.820]   You want to change jobs.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.780]   What's a money failure?
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.180]   Let's say, worst case scenario, you lose all your money.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.500]   Is it possible to fail by losing all your money?
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.900]   That's not failure.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.700]   You run out of food.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.260]   Guess what?
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.780]   There's food stamps, or whatever they're called now, UBT, SNAP.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.500]   I don't know.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.020]   There's food stamps.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.900]   They'll give you money for food every month.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.860]   And that's enough money to support your family.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.420]   So if you've got three kids or four kids or five kids,
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   you're going to have enough to feed your family.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.780]   Or if you're a single guy or gal,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.660]   you're going to have enough to feed yourself.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.700]   There's charities.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.900]   If you're homeless and you don't have any money,
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.460]   there's a charity that will feed you.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.460]   Your mom will feed you.
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.660]   Your dad will feed you.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.140]   And I'm not going to feed you forever.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.340]   But so you're not going to run out of food.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.380]   You're not going to starve.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.260]   Now, there's some place in the world where you are.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.100]   There's places in the world where
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.180]   you're starving right now.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.740]   But I would assume that if you're hearing my voice,
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.420]   you're not in that situation.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.260]   And we need to work to help people in those situations.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.580]   But in the US, come on.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.080]   You're not going to run out of food.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.180]   Are you going to be homeless?
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.940]   You're not going to be homeless.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.540]   There's Section 8 housing assistance.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.700]   The government will stick you in a place to live.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.020]   There's housing charities.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.300]   My favorite thing on housing--
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.800]   I just think one of my favorite movies I've always enjoyed,
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.900]   which should be probably pretty obvious why,
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.500]   is "Pursuit of Happiness," the story of Will Smith portrayed
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.580]   Chris Gardner, who started--
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.500]   was it Gardner?
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.140]   I don't remember the name of his firm.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.020]   But he started a large financial firm, which was sold,
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.460]   which was sold, which was sold, which always
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.660]   happens with financial firms.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.420]   But a guy in the filming of the movie,
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.460]   he's sleeping in a subway bathroom.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.820]   But so what?
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.180]   He's not out in the cold.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.220]   He's sleeping in a subway bathroom.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.380]   One of things I think about, OK, you lose everything
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.140]   if you have a car.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.340]   Live in your car.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.060]   Is it so bad?
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.380]   Well, to one person, it's bad.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.940]   To another person, it's an adventure.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.500]   Go online.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.780]   Find somebody who's living in a car.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.220]   And again, hopefully-- I mean, you can get a minivan.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.060]   Minivan is the ideal car to live in if you're
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.060]   trying to live cheap.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.660]   Is it really so bad?
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.260]   I don't know.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.860]   Look at it as an adventure.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:46.100]   I remember a story that has stuck out to me about--
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:46.980]   I think the author--
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.420]   I think the author was Tynan, who
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.540]   writes an interesting blog over at Tynan, T-Y-N-A-N dot com,
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.660]   Tynan dot com.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.340]   And he writes about-- he lives in an RV.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.500]   And his RV story is kind of interesting.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.460]   He moved from a big, fancy condo into an RV.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.940]   And read his essays on it.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.940]   It's rather interesting.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.280]   But he lives in an RV by choice, not
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.700]   that he can't live somewhere else.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.460]   He chooses to live in a small RV.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.220]   And I think if I'm citing the story correctly--
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.760]   I'll have to Google it when I'm done.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.420]   But if I'm citing the story correctly,
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.820]   he's parked on the street one day.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.980]   And he comes out of his RV.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.580]   And he looks across the street, and there's another RV.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.260]   And the guy on the other side's coming out of his RV, too.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.300]   So he walks over.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.880]   And he says, hey, man, how you doing?
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.660]   Guy responds, how's it look like I'm doing?
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.340]   I'm living in an RV.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.460]   I think Tynan says, come on, man.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.900]   And he didn't know what to say.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.020]   Because by him, living in an RV was awesome.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.780]   It's an awesome lifestyle.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.820]   So I just thought, wow, what a difference
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:49.220]   of perspective makes.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.900]   So things like that, just viewing the struggle that
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.780]   can be part of the adventure.
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.900]   You're not going to fail.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.100]   You run out of money, guess what?
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.100]   They'll give you cash payments, welfare cash assistance
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.980]   programs, or whatever it's called.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.900]   I don't remember what the formal name of it is.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.900]   Is it going to be a lot?
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:03.400]   No.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.420]   Is it going to be enough?
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.780]   Probably.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.380]   Why on earth would you go and slave in a job
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.900]   when you can build a business, if you
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.660]   want to build a business, or if you have a dream?
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.300]   Why would you not go and follow that?
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.460]   And all this stuff is there.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:16.820]   Take it.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.380]   Use it.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.020]   That's what it's there for.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.180]   Somebody's going to get it.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.340]   Why not you?
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.020]   Medical care?
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.220]   Obamacare?
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:25.860]   Medicaid?
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.700]   Medicaid was massively expanded in the last couple years.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.740]   You can walk into any hospital in the country,
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.660]   and if your leg is bleeding, they will take you in
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.020]   and they will fix you.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.340]   They give you a cell phone if you don't make any money.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.460]   So you can run your business.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.740]   If you want to start a business, and you fail,
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.860]   and you run out of all your money,
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.220]   and you get kicked out of your apartment,
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.460]   and you're behind on your bills, you can go down.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.940]   You can live in Section 8 housing.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.980]   You can get an internet connection from the coffee shop
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.900]   next door.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.620]   Get a $200 Chromebook to run your business on.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.380]   They'll give you a cell phone to pay and some money for food,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.540]   and start your business.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.980]   I mean, I wouldn't say that would be the primary thing,
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.020]   but I guess a lot of my life, you're always
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.260]   just worried about failure.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.140]   Oh, go into debt.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.460]   OK, so you go into debt.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.420]   All right, you can't pay it.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.380]   Well, don't pay it.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.380]   You get behind on your bills.
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.000]   There's lots of people that have gotten behind on their bills.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.980]   So don't pay it.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.260]   Run your household on cash.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.260]   Change your phone number.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.420]   Worst comes to worst, you can't pay your bills,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.500]   declare bankruptcy.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.420]   You borrowed a bunch of money on student loans,
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.540]   which aren't bankruptable.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.540]   Well, go into the black market.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.700]   I mean, the drug dealers figure out how to live.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.660]   The illegal immigrants figure out how to live.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.140]   Figure it out.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.820]   The thing that is driving us is the fear of failure
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.660]   is not usually a rational fear.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.300]   Again, you're not going to fail.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:53.980]   What is failure?
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.820]   You're going to die?
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.460]   You're not going to die.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.540]   What the actual fear of failure is,
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:03.100]   is the actual fear of failure is a mental construct.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.580]   It's a fear of looking foolish.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.900]   It's a fear of other people lowering their opinions.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.820]   It's a mental game.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.780]   Now, do I think that you should do all those things?
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.260]   Well, actually, I do if you're using it for something.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.820]   If I had my way, I'd snap my fingers
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.900]   and eliminate all of them.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.520]   But guess what?
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.100]   No one's electing me president.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.580]   I'd eliminate all those programs.
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.500]   And I'd keep it in the hands of private charities.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.640]   But no one's asking me.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.940]   And no matter how I vote, it doesn't
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.020]   seem to change anything.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.140]   So I say, I can't do anything about the national situation,
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.140]   but I can do something about my life.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.300]   And so if worse comes to worse and I fail,
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.900]   that's what it's there for.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.260]   And if worse comes to worse and you fail,
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.580]   that's what it's there for.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.020]   You're not going to die.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.820]   And then the other thing is that if you look at it-- so
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.180]   failure, fear of failure.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.020]   I'll use the example of starting a business.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.340]   Fear of failing because we're going to start a business.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.020]   Well, there's no rational-- under the scenario I just
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.460]   laid out, there's no rational fear of dying.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.180]   So then it's a mental fear of taking charity,
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.980]   of being dependent, of being on the dole.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.980]   Again, I'm kind of against all those things.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.260]   I'm a card-carrying libertarian, but about as far out
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.300]   on the kooky political fringe as possible.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.020]   But it exists.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.340]   Why not use it if you have to?
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.020]   So you say, OK, well, then it's a fear of looking foolish.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.340]   Well, is your mom going to love you less because you start
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.940]   a business and you lose all your money?
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.580]   Is your best friend not going to go have a drink with you
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.740]   because you started a business and you went bankrupt?
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.300]   I mean, in this country, the bankruptcy laws
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.740]   are the most amazing thing ever.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.660]   Consider-- who to consider?
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.120]   I mean, there's dozens of examples.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.660]   Consider-- Donald Trump was a-- go read his book,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.700]   "The Art of the Deal."
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.380]   A billion dollars in debt.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.740]   A billion dollars negative net worth.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.820]   A billion dollars.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.740]   They turned it around.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:08.060]   And the financial-- Dave Ramsey, in the financial world.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.540]   I guarantee some of you listen to Dave Ramsey.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.820]   What did Dave Ramsey do?
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.820]   Starts a business, fails at it, does some dumb stuff
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.980]   with his financing, does dumb stuff, declares bankruptcy,
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.500]   and starts all over again.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.180]   And today, makes millions of dollars
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.180]   every year with one of the highest-rated radio
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.420]   shows in the country, plus all of his other 83
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.020]   different lines of income.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.260]   He's an amazing business guy.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.740]   His other 83 lines of income coming into his company.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.420]   And the whole thing is based upon-- I declared bankruptcy.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.740]   I was stupid, so let me tell you how stupid I was
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.140]   and how not to be stupid.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.380]   I mean, it's laughable.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.060]   And yet, here's the American dream.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.660]   Goes deeply into debt.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.540]   Can't pay it off.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.900]   Declares bankruptcy.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.060]   Starts afresh.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.180]   And today, makes millions of dollars a year
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.820]   teaching people how not to borrow money,
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.340]   how not to do what he did.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.500]   But yet, what did he do?
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.900]   He declared bankruptcy and wiped away his debts
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.620]   and started fresh.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.380]   So I mean, he's a great guy.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.860]   I have lots of issues with him, but he's
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.980]   done an amazing amount of good for a lot of people.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.340]   But the reality is that he is a financial advisor.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.860]   Or he's not a financial advisor.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:25.540]   He is a financial entertainer who his entire business
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.700]   is based upon his history of failing.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.620]   And yet today, there are millions and millions
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.780]   and millions of people across this country
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.780]   who look up to him and appreciate the work
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.660]   that he does.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.580]   So who defines failure?
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.740]   Is failure an event?
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.340]   Is failure winning?
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.800]   Or is failure quitting?
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.760]   There are a lot of people who go to the Olympics
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.260]   and only three of them get a medal.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.500]   But are they now not Olympians because they didn't win?
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.900]   Winning is a stupid definition of success.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.360]   I mean, well, I guess it depends on how you define winning.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.500]   But not everyone's going to come out on top.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.420]   So you get to define failure.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.820]   Zig Zig, back to Zig Ziglar.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.740]   My favorite quote of his--
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.020]   I can hear his voice.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.580]   I can't do a Southern drawl.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.620]   But here is what he'd say over and over again.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.060]   And it's my favorite saying to say to myself.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.060]   Failure is an event.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.860]   It's not a person.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.740]   Yesterday really did end last night.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.780]   Today is a brand new day.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.420]   And it's yours.
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.500]   Again, I wish I could do his Southern drawl.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.120]   Or I should go find a recording of him.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.620]   But failure is an event.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.340]   It's not a person.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.020]   Yesterday did end last night.
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.620]   Done.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.460]   Gone.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.260]   Today is a brand new day.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.780]   And it's yours.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.620]   So I just say study the worst that can happen
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.780]   and be OK with it.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.620]   I think one of the particularly useful tips
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.660]   in Tim Ferriss's book, "Four-Hour Work Week,"
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.660]   was-- and I think this is key--
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.700]   is consider the worst case possible scenario,
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.220]   worst possible scenario that could happen
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.060]   under a course of action.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.180]   And then ask yourself if you're willing to accept it
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.500]   if it happens.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.100]   And then work like crazy to make sure it doesn't happen.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.660]   So if the worst case scenario of--
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.540]   again, worst case scenario for me,
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.260]   changing, leaving the business that I had
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.340]   and changing to some new ventures,
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.380]   primarily this podcast.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.420]   OK, so I walk away from a business.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.940]   I lose all my clients.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.300]   I lose all my money.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.580]   I wind up going deeply in debt.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.380]   I wind up bankrupt.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.800]   I don't plan for that to happen.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.340]   I work pretty hard to make sure it doesn't happen.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.060]   But let's say I spend all my money.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.260]   And I go wind up bankrupt.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.220]   Guess what?
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.460]   I can start again.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.180]   And I'm willing to deal with that
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.900]   because I fear the pain of regret
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.260]   more than I fear the pain of failure, the pain of bankruptcy
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.580]   or the pain of a business closing.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.220]   There's businesses that close every day.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.620]   Walt Disney, what did he go bankrupt three times on his way
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.700]   to starting Disney World?
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.460]   But you don't remember him for his bankruptcy.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.940]   Again, Dave Ramsey, bankrupt?
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.260]   Yes, but you don't know him today for his bankruptcy.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.060]   There are lots and lots of people that have failed.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.660]   I don't remember what the numbers are.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.340]   I could look them up.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.380]   But we won't worry with actual numbers today.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.820]   Lots of people have failed.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.380]   So study the worst that could happen and be OK with it.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.500]   And the other thing I've learned is
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.260]   that no matter what the worst case scenario is,
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.820]   there's a way to make it really good.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.140]   I remember this when I worked with a prospective client who--
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.900]   my actual client was a family member of this person.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.900]   And they referred me to the family member.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.220]   And they said, hey, maybe you can meet with this person
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.100]   and help him.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.940]   So I meet with them.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.580]   And what I find out is that the person has no money.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.820]   And they're living on Social Security disability.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.780]   But yet the person is living on a sailboat.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.380]   And here in West Palm Beach, in part of the year
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.780]   in the Caribbean, I thought, what an awesome, awesome
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.660]   example of taking what some people would say
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.180]   is a really awful lifestyle--
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.420]   I'm living on Social Security disability--
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.500]   and figuring out how to make what a lot of people
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.900]   would say is a really awesome lifestyle out of it.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:05.780]   I remember a friend of mine had a friend who would come.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.580]   And this person would come down to Florida.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.620]   And this person was a really great gentleman,
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.500]   an elderly gentleman, kind of the big, kind of bearded
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.980]   mountain man that you'd run into at a folk music festival.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.700]   And this person lived in his car.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.820]   And he lived in a van.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.700]   And he lived on, again, Social Security, I think.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.780]   It was a very small Social Security payment.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.780]   But he would come down.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.080]   And my friend would let him park in his yard.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.280]   And he would have a free place to stay every winter,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.320]   in Florida in the winter.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.020]   And he'd go up to New England in the summer.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.180]   How's that for a great way to make a great life?
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.380]   Now, I don't particularly want to live in a van,
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.000]   or at least not--
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.760]   I don't particularly want to live in a van
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.780]   with a large family, one person that might be cool.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.820]   But the reality is that it's a lot better than slaving away
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.220]   in cubicle nation.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.540]   So you can make any situation fun
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.700]   if you learn the skills of how to do that.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.180]   I think of the early retirement extreme book, which
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.780]   highly recommend, if you haven't read it, buy it and read it.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.380]   But you've got Jacob, who talked about how he lived,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.540]   I think it was $7,000 a year of expenses,
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.460]   even though he had plenty of money that he could spend,
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.980]   and with skills, supplanted the need for the high income.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.460]   So that's the key.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.420]   Which brings us on to number four, which
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.060]   my piece of advice number four is study skills
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.060]   that actually matter.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.660]   How important is it, really, in the age of Google,
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.620]   to be able to name exactly what the capital of every country
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.620]   in the world is?
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.260]   Not that important.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.780]   But how important is it to know how
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.860]   to have successful relationships?
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.900]   Pretty important.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:43.020]   How important is it to have communication skills?
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.540]   Pretty important.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.900]   How important is it to understand finance?
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.140]   Pretty important.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.060]   How important is it to have skills of creativity
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.700]   and ideation, like the ability to come up with new ideas?
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.060]   That's pretty important.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.980]   How about the skills of how to make stuff, build stuff,
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:03.820]   create stuff?
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:08.300]   How about studying the things, creating success skills?
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.860]   Those things are pretty important.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.580]   And all of those things are really, really learnable.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.220]   Our society is so crazy.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.500]   We talk about skills constantly in our world.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.860]   We talk about skills like how to keep an empty inbox at work.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.060]   Inbox zero, right?
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.220]   Super useful.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.300]   Do my best to do it.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.340]   Fail a lot of the times.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.740]   But super useful.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.660]   What about skills like building your own house?
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:32.700]   Read an essay one time.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.900]   I'd love to find it, but thought, what a great idea.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.580]   But the essay was advice for-- I think
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.060]   it was a high school student.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.620]   And the advice was basically, don't go to college.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.340]   I mean, unless you want to go to college.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.860]   But the advice was essentially, consider another way.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.500]   Consider, instead of going to college,
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.060]   consider going into the trades and learning
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.580]   how to work in some of the trades
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.420]   and learning how to build stuff.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.020]   Go and work in construction, work
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.460]   in various aspects of construction.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.140]   Hire yourself out at minimum wage
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.660]   as an apprentice across various trades.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.140]   And then save money, live cheap, save money, work hard.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.340]   And then buy the materials and little by little
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.380]   build your own house.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.020]   And the plan, I don't remember, it was mid-20s or 23 or 25
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.700]   or something.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.440]   But now you're living in a paid-for house
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.340]   that you built yourself.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.760]   You don't have to deal with a mortgage payment
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.940]   for the rest of your life.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.820]   And you've been able to set this up.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.980]   That's a pretty good plan.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.460]   But all of that comes from having those skills.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.540]   Investing in skills, which is what
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.860]   this point, the major point that I'm trying to make,
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.500]   investing in skills pays all kinds of dividends.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.180]   You see this all the time in the trades.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.100]   If you have friends or if you work in the trades,
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.580]   many people have one skill.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.780]   I am an electrician.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.340]   Well, when the electrical market goes down,
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.420]   you've got to have another backup skill.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.980]   You've got to have other skills that you can fall back on.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.260]   It would be really nice if you had multiple businesses
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.940]   and you can just slide between them.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.580]   We've replaced skills with money.
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.780]   Back to Jacob from Early Retirement Extreme,
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.400]   he talks a lot about that in his book.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.740]   He says that you can either choose to spend money on stuff
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.580]   or you can have the skills to do it.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.500]   And neither is right or wrong, in my opinion.
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.700]   If you want to spend your money and hire a person to do that,
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.220]   that's great.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.920]   There's lots of things I don't like doing
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.340]   and I'd rather hire someone to do.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.020]   But then again, if you don't have the money
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.420]   or don't want to spend the money,
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.540]   replace it with the skills.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.460]   You can't take skills away.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.940]   People are all worried about--
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.640]   it seems like half the society these days
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.220]   is all worried about the economy blowing up
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.660]   and the country melting into chaos
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.660]   and trying to figure out what's going to save
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.420]   your lifestyle in that situation.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.660]   What's going to save your lifestyle in that situation
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.700]   is exactly what's going to make you rich before that situation,
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.700]   and it's skills.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.980]   If you're a skillful, valuable person
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.380]   and you've got a strong social network,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.340]   that's going to be incredibly valuable to you
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.540]   if you had a societal collapse.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.980]   Who were the Jews that got out of Germany under Hitler?
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.060]   They were the ones that had money, yes, but also a lot of them
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.560]   that didn't have money that had some kind of social support
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.980]   structure that could funnel them out of the country,
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.620]   or they had connections.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.780]   Those people got out too.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.020]   So you can have connections.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.900]   You can build skills.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.900]   This is not a financial thing.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.100]   I just say, if I were talking to an 18-year-old me,
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.460]   I'd say, skip Cubicle Nation.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.940]   I worked in Cubicle Nation for one year.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.820]   Sorry to steal-- what was that, Pam Slim's book, I think?
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.940]   I don't remember who the author of that book was,
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.220]   but I hope I'm not infringing on her trademark.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.260]   But skip Cubicle Nation.
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.460]   There are millions of people stuck in Cubicle Nation.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.380]   Work on skills.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.220]   Again, go join a construction crew and learn to build houses.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.100]   Learn finance.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.220]   Learn a skill, and you can get out and then
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.620]   build a business on that.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.620]   That is what will ultimately really make
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.580]   a lot of freedom over time.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.260]   Number five, explore.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.820]   So I would just say, give up on dogma and have an open mind.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.220]   So take the classes you enjoy.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.260]   One thing I wish I'd done differently in college
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.720]   is when I was in college, I was trying to finish my degree.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.540]   I was paying for it.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.020]   I was trying to finish my degree.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.860]   So I just took courses in my degree.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.820]   And now I look back and say, what an awesome time
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.340]   that I could have had to sit back and just learn
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.700]   without-- and take classes that I'm interested in,
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.420]   not because I care about the credit,
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.780]   but just go to all these classes that are offered.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.900]   That's what I love so much about the world we live in today.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.980]   I can go to iTunes U. I can go to Creative Live.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.500]   I can go to Coursera.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.740]   I can go to all these places.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.340]   I can take these courses.
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.140]   And I've got YouTube.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.020]   I've got everything right at my fingertips
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.460]   of all the wacky things that I'm interested in.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.780]   So I can explore things with no cost.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.060]   What an amazing world.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.220]   And the idea of exploration is don't set out
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.140]   and say, I'm going to make this thing work.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.300]   The best ideas are usually probably unplanned.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.420]   But go out and explore things.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.060]   And don't be concerned with being right all the time.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.020]   I have made that mistake for a long time,
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.620]   is that I just want to be right.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.220]   And these days, hopefully, I'm learning to be done with that.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.020]   Don't worry about being right.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.460]   Be fascinated.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.940]   Be fascinated with life.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.760]   Be fascinated with other people's stories.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.180]   Be fascinated.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.060]   Financial planning, I've learned the hard way
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.380]   to have an open mind.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.420]   Because I used to say and tell people
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.420]   how they should live their life.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.900]   Now I've learned, hopefully-- you
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.400]   have to ask someone that's actually
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.300]   worked with me to prove it-- but I've
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.420]   learned how to listen a lot better.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.540]   And then just understand.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.860]   Again, we give a few ideas for after listening,
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.620]   a few ideas for how I think they might
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.980]   be able to get a little closer to what they're trying to do.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.740]   The dogma and the closed mind on things.
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.500]   I'll give you one of my personal struggles.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.460]   For years, I picked on Dave Ramsey earlier.
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.700]   And I'm sure I'll pick on him a lot.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.300]   Because he's the front runner.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.620]   And that's what happens when you're out in the front
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.500]   and up on top.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.740]   But I always struggled.
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.100]   Because for years, I would listen to Dave Ramsey.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.180]   And Dave Ramsey would preach, don't lease a car.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:05.900]   Don't lease a car.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.640]   Don't lease a car.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.820]   Don't lease a car.
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.020]   And buy a car.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.540]   Buy a car.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.380]   Don't lease a car.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.100]   Now do I agree with him?
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:11.980]   Yeah, I do.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.980]   I've never leased a car.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.640]   Don't plan to.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.900]   Don't really want to.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.940]   But then you read something like "4-Hour Workweek."
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.980]   And in Tim's book, you read about the process
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.260]   of dreamlining.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.740]   And you say, OK, let's start with dreamlining.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.160]   And the example he uses in there is, let's say
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.820]   you want to buy an Aston Martin.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.740]   Well, guess what?
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.980]   You can go down and you can lease an Aston Martin for,
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.860]   I don't know what it was, $1,500 a month.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.660]   That makes sense.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.220]   Really.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.180]   If you had a business that was creating $1,500 a month,
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:48.700]   why is it somehow morally superior to wait until,
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.900]   I don't know, 40 years or 30 years
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.540]   until you can somehow have so much money
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.220]   that you've put your money in retirement
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.380]   and you can lease the Aston Martin?
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.820]   Now, I personally am not interested in leasing
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.700]   an Aston Martin.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.660]   Because I'm more interested in being financially independent.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:07.980]   For me, I value the ability to be completely financially
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.260]   independent more than I value the ability
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.860]   to drive the Aston Martin.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.940]   But I think it's a cool idea to go rent one.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.300]   Rent one for a couple of weekends
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.780]   and get the feeling of it.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.380]   If that's what you like to do, awesome.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.460]   Go for it.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:25.820]   So the dogma of those things, don't lease cars,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.860]   which is fine.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   He can run his show how he wants to,
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.700]   but I'll run my show how I want to.
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.380]   But that dogma winds up just kind of destroying things
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.980]   instead of saying, you know what?
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.260]   All of us, we can choose to rent a car.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.180]   That's what leasing is.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.660]   It's called renting a car.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.260]   And if we want to do that and it makes sense, good for that.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.100]   Good for us.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.460]   This whole idea of paying cash for businesses
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.500]   versus starting with debt.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.180]   Most people start with debt.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.100]   I don't think-- I think it's probably smarter
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.300]   to start with money.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.260]   And it forces to be more agile.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:56.900]   But guess what?
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.380]   Most businesses, I think--
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.700]   I don't know about most.
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.140]   I shouldn't be so loose with--
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.320]   I don't know the percentage.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.300]   But a lot of businesses start with debt.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.180]   And so this idea that it's only done one way,
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.220]   it may be a better way.
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.780]   We can sell the way.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.060]   But this idea that it's only done one way is damaging.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:20.100]   Number six, get clear on your priorities in life,
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.060]   your priorities.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.300]   And be OK with them changing.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.500]   Understand all your options.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:30.020]   So much of our lives, it seems, we
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.340]   live according to other people's priorities.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.860]   We buy houses because other people think we should,
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.000]   rather than because we want to.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.660]   We think we want to, but it's for other people's priorities.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:44.580]   And a lot of people, I think, would prefer--
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.140]   I mean, if you were to give this either/or thing to me--
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.540]   and let's assume that I'm single,
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.980]   so I can just do what I want to do.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.860]   And let's assume that I could do whatever I want to do.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.380]   If you give this either/or to me and say, Joshua,
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.780]   you can buy a house and live in one town all the time
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.460]   and take two-week vacations, or you can choose to rent
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.960]   and every three months go to a new place,
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.420]   I would probably choose the three months if it were just me
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.040]   and I weren't interested in being close to family.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.620]   At this point, I've consciously chosen
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.800]   not to live that kind of lifestyle,
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.300]   but I think that would be awesome.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.220]   And there are a lot of other reasons
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.560]   why I've chosen not to do that.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.260]   But there are people that have done that.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.140]   But I never knew when I was 18 years old
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.580]   that that was even an option.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.820]   I never knew that I could do something like--
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.640]   let me see.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.860]   I think the website is Where Is Kyle Now?
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.780]   And the man, his name is Kyle.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.580]   I don't know his last name, but his website
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.940]   is Where Is Kyle Now?
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.100]   And here you have this man named Kyle
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.780]   who got sick and tired of living in an apartment
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.140]   as a web programmer or computer programmer of some kind,
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.380]   went and bought an Airstream trailer.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.140]   And for the last two, three, four years,
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.340]   something like that, he's gone and traveled
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:53.380]   all over North America, staying in different places,
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.460]   been to all 50 states, every province in Canada,
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.580]   something like that.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.180]   What a cool lifestyle for someone who's a web programmer.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.420]   There's people all over the place that are doing this.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.540]   There's people online.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.500]   The Tropical MBA folks are all living in Thailand,
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.580]   doing these things.
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.660]   I never knew that was an option when I was 18 years old.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.620]   Well, frankly, it probably wasn't an option
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.620]   when I was 18 years old.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.780]   But today, it is an option.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.020]   And so be aware of all your options,
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.820]   and then get clear on what your priorities are.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.380]   I live where I live because that's where my family is,
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.540]   and that's where I'm involved with the people,
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.140]   and the church, and the place that I want to be.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.460]   But a lot of people just kind of live where they grew up,
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.580]   not intentionally choosing to live there.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.300]   Understand what your priorities and your options are.
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.700]   Number seven, focus on building good habits.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:49.740]   I'm convinced that health and wealth are largely habits.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.860]   Health is not achieved in a pill.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.540]   It's achieved in having good lifestyle habits.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.940]   Wealth is not achieved in a pill.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.980]   It's achieved in having good lifestyle habits.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:08.180]   So the idea of spending less than you make, that's a habit.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.540]   The idea of building your skills, and your knowledge,
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.020]   and your income, that's a habit.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.940]   Focus on building the right habits,
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.820]   and the end result will take care of itself.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.900]   Number eight, I would say to the 18-year-old me,
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.700]   carefully consider your high school and college decisions,
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.540]   especially the college decision.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.420]   Consider all your options, and just be careful
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.740]   that you don't limit your choices.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.060]   In today's world, there are a lot of choices.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.820]   And I'm going to do some shows on college.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.420]   And you have two things that are very popular.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.300]   The most common, still mainstream,
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.940]   is you need to go to college so that you can get a good job
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.100]   and pay money.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.540]   And now it's become quite popular to say, well,
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.940]   you don't shouldn't go to college.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.500]   You should just start a business instead.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.220]   I don't believe either of them are right.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.380]   And we're going to pour through some of the data.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.020]   It's very interesting, the data, because education,
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:07.740]   formal education, still has a dramatic, dramatic effect
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.380]   on earning potential.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.140]   And this is by far one of the best financial investments
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.100]   that somebody who is right for college
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.860]   and who's going to finish college can make.
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.620]   However, when you dig into the data
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.740]   and you pull out the people who don't make it through college,
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:27.900]   then you find a very different story.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.860]   And so I would say get clear on your priorities
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   and carefully consider the college decisions.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.260]   For some people, going to college
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.240]   at a mainstream four-year university
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.540]   is going to be the perfect decision.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.880]   And for other people, the perfect decision
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.100]   is going to be made based upon going to iTunes University
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.640]   while living on the road in 80 different countries
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.380]   for four years and blogging your way through it.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.100]   These are not right or wrong.
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.980]   They're only right or wrong if they're made hastily and not
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:46:59.940]   thought out.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.460]   But there are a lot of options.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.060]   And there are a lot of options.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.460]   And I'll leave that one with that,
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.420]   because I'm going to do an entire show on that
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:08.260]   in the future.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.180]   Number nine, stay flexible.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.100]   And so by flexible, I mean in this situation,
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:18.380]   things like don't have a lot of stuff and don't borrow money.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.300]   So I think two powerful ideas that
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.900]   can be really useful for financial planning
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:29.420]   are the ideas of minimalism and debtlessness.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:33.300]   And the reality is here is that minimalism, basically
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.700]   a consciously choosing to live life
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:37.900]   with fewer or an appropriate amount of things
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.020]   rather than always trying to pile up as many things as
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.700]   possible, that can be really freeing.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.660]   Because if you don't have so much stuff that you
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:49.660]   need a five-bedroom house, you have a lot of options.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.220]   Guys like Tynan, who I mentioned earlier,
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.260]   if he can live in a backpack, he can go anywhere in the world.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.420]   And that's what he does.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.460]   I think he still does it.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.220]   So if you have all your stuff that fits in a backpack,
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.220]   or in his case, in a very small RV, you can go wherever.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.500]   And now you have options.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.500]   And then the idea of debtlessness,
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.420]   if your income is not committed, if your future income is not
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.180]   already committed, which is what debt is--
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.220]   debt is just simply a pledging of future income
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.440]   and future dollars to things that are already done--
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.180]   then you have choices.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.180]   And so if you lose your job, consider these two things,
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.540]   these two scenarios.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.420]   You have a large house with a large payment
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.900]   and a bunch of other large payments and a bunch of stuff,
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.140]   and you lose your job.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.740]   And you can't find another one in the town that you're in.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.900]   Or you lose your job, you have a little bit of stuff,
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.620]   not too much, and you have no debt,
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:51.060]   whether that's because you rent or because you don't own a home.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:53.400]   And if you rent, what an awesome situation.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.080]   And no matter where you are in a 12-month lease,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.680]   in less than 12 months, you can be out of there.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.900]   Try selling a house three or four years ago
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.360]   when you're in this two-year sales cycle world,
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.800]   this weird real estate world that we were in for so long.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.820]   You weren't selling a house in four months
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.000]   and going to another town to start a new job.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.560]   But that's what flexibility can get.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.760]   Now, with flexibility comes certain disadvantages.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.560]   So I own a home.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.800]   I'm not that flexible.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.500]   However, I gain other value from the home.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.460]   And that's a perfectly rational decision to give up on that.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.320]   But for the 18-year-old me, for that beginning phase of life,
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.500]   I would say maintain flexibility and consider
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.320]   the value of the ideas of minimalism and debtlessness
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.140]   in your planning.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:41.060]   Number 10, invest in yourself and follow your hunches.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.100]   The best investments are always in yourself
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.020]   and in something that you know, whether that
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.200]   means through formal education, whether that
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.580]   means through informal education.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:57.900]   And I think it's really freeing to follow your hunches.
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.740]   In some ways, I feel like this is a lesson
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.740]   that I've only just learned and am only just learning.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.300]   I've done a lot of different things.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.780]   But doing this podcast is kind of, for me, is a hunch.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.780]   I think that there is a desire.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.540]   I see this desire online.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.860]   I feel like there's this desire for financial knowledge
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.740]   that goes deeper, that goes a little bit deeper than just
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.540]   the surface fluff, not the mainstream.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.960]   And I would never expect this show
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.220]   to appeal to the mainstream.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.900]   But I see this hunger for information.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.460]   And I don't see it being served.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.740]   Now, I've got a hunch that this whole podcast medium
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:39.220]   is going to be a major, major area of growth
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.600]   over the coming five years.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.100]   Five years ago, if you told someone, I'm a blogger,
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.460]   no one knew what you were saying.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.940]   But today, everyone would know what that means.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.020]   And everybody reads blogs.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.780]   Well, podcasting is still non-mainstream.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.380]   Very few people know what a podcast is.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.980]   Very few people listen to them.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.740]   Very few people know how to do that.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.900]   Five years from now, I believe it's
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.100]   going to be very different.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.260]   And you're going to have a world of people looking
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.980]   for information, especially on the things they're
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.620]   interested in.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.580]   Some of those people are interested in finance.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.660]   So by creating the kind of show that I
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.100]   want to create that I would like to listen to-- excuse me.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.740]   By creating the kind of show that I want to listen to,
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.860]   then it's fun for me to create.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.660]   And I'm hoping, I believe, that there's at least a few hundred
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.000]   people out there that are probably pretty similar to me,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.060]   because we're all pretty much like each other.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.340]   And I think that over time, my hope
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.220]   is that it could build into a business.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:34.300]   And I can serve you, the listener,
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.340]   I can serve you with clear, straightforward financial
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:41.700]   education that covers the technical and the actual.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.280]   I've got to come up with another name.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.980]   If you know a better name, please let me know.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.260]   I don't know how to compare this dichotomy between what
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.980]   I call the technical and the behavioral,
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.940]   or the technical and the-- I'm struggling with the name.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.300]   But the idea is that these kinds of things
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.460]   that I'm talking about today, these, in my opinion,
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.660]   make far bigger of a difference than saying,
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.540]   open a Roth IRA on your 18th birthday.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.740]   And yet, I think opening a Roth IRA is awesome.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.860]   But I want to start with what actually matters,
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.700]   which is things like, don't be scared of people,
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.940]   because so many people are scared.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.920]   And when you're scared, you take a junkie job
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.500]   that you don't want to have, and then you
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.300]   ask your financial planner, how can I get rich,
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.300]   and how can I have lots of money when I can only
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.980]   afford to save $100 a month?
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.980]   The answer is you can't, period, unless you
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.620]   do something more and different.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.460]   Now, can $100 a month over 40 years at 10% make you a millionaire?
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.220]   Yes, probably.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.540]   I've got to rerun the numbers.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.580]   But yes, it could.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:34.460]   But nobody does it.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.620]   Nobody has done that.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.380]   And nobody does it.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.820]   So you've got to do something else.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.580]   And you've got to figure out who you are
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.900]   and how to be OK with yourself.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.740]   So rant over.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.380]   But if you know of a word--
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.260]   I'm trying to come up with a difference
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.220]   between the technical, what guys like me, people
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.260]   think guys like me do for a living,
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:59.140]   and the behavioral, the emotional, the psychological,
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:03.660]   the inspirational, that type of thing.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.940]   Because they've got to go hand in hand.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.620]   Again, the reason people are fat, the reason I'm fat,
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.140]   is not because of lack of technical knowledge
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.900]   or techniques that are unproven.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.980]   There's lots of technical knowledge and techniques
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:15.940]   that are unproven.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.300]   The reason is all of those psychological things,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.620]   all those other hang-ups.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.540]   I'm trying to figure out how to describe that.
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.100]   So you can help me with that.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.180]   Back to invest in yourself and follow your hunches.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.380]   Consider, give things a go.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.380]   And so my point was that with the podcast,
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.960]   I've done a lot of interesting things.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.420]   But I'm following a hunch.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.660]   I've taken a completely blind jump off a cliff.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.940]   And I'm willing to go splat, so that's OK.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.420]   But I'm just following a hunch.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:44.020]   But yet, I love doing it.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.060]   It's so fun.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.340]   And I enjoy-- yesterday, prepping that big, long show
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:49.540]   and trying to dig through it.
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:50.300]   It's a lot.
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.900]   But I really enjoy it.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.740]   And I think it's just super fun.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.780]   So I'm following a hunch.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.240]   And it's so freeing to be out there on the edge.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.580]   That's where the fun is, right?
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.980]   Talk to any extreme sport athlete.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.900]   It's not playing it safe, where you
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.380]   get that rush of adrenaline that's out there on the edge.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.020]   Well, I'm not an extreme sports guy.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.060]   No interest in it.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.300]   But I can do exactly the same thing with business
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:10.860]   and with ideas like this.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.340]   So follow your hunch.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.540]   Consider investing in yourself through things
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.660]   like the personal MBA.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.580]   If you're not familiar with the personal MBA,
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.980]   Google it and read 100 books on business.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.820]   And you'll gain a huge amount of knowledge.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.340]   You may still want to go back and get a traditional MBA
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.980]   with a certificate.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.900]   But follow things like that.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.480]   If you look at the guy who wrote that,
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.540]   I think his name is Joshua--
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:35.820]   blanking on his last name.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.140]   But the author's name was Joshua something or other.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.460]   And he wrote the personal MBA.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.700]   And he was working a corporate job,
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.040]   started reading all these books.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.460]   And today, he's got this incredible business,
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.620]   this online business, where he does exactly what
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:51.340]   he wants to do every day.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:55.260]   My favorite thing about his site--
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:58.180]   if you want to be inspired, go look at his About page.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.780]   Go look at his page where he says Availability.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:06.100]   And what you'll find is that he says--
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.020]   give me just a second.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.100]   I'm going to pull this up.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.500]   It's Josh Kaufman.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:14.020]   And I've got it here, joshkaufman.net, K-A-U-F-M-A-N.
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:17.980]   And if you look here on his site, then what you will see
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.760]   is he's got a thing on here called Status.
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:21.580]   And listen to this.
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.460]   How's this for-- so this man, I've never talked to him.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.500]   I just read his book.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.000]   And I've read-- I really have enjoyed
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.540]   a bunch of his blog posts.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.820]   And so you've got a man named Josh Kaufman.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:32.700]   And he said-- so he started-- his story
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.460]   is that he started in the corporate world.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.820]   He was working for some big Fortune 500 company,
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.700]   started reading a bunch of books on marketing
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.340]   and on business and all these things.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.900]   And then over time, he started writing reviews of them.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.940]   And he compiled them into the Personal MBA, which
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.660]   is his list of 100 books that he curates this list,
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.200]   that these are the best 100 books
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.420]   for every area of business.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.580]   It's really great.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.260]   I haven't finished all of them, but I've read a lot of them.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.940]   And I really encourage you to consider doing the same thing.
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.860]   So you go on his website.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.140]   He's a young man.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.740]   And it says, it's joshkaufman.net/status,
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:06.740]   if you're interested.
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.100]   Josh Kaufman status, bestselling author, business
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.140]   and learning expert.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.820]   And at the top, every day I receive
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.140]   many requests concerning my availability for consulting,
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.980]   interviews, and new projects.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.500]   In the interest of saving time, here's
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.780]   my current status and capacity.
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.140]   Summary, unavailable.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:28.700]   How awesome is that?
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.140]   I have very young kids at home.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:34.140]   As a result, I am unavailable for travel, interviews, media,
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.420]   speaking, consulting, book reviews,
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.340]   and new speculative projects.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.500]   I'm curtailing my interview availability,
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.380]   have no capacity to examine book galleys for reviews
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.180]   and blurbs, and my guest post docket is full.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.300]   Publishing on this site will continue sporadically
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.140]   as time and energy permit.
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:53.340]   Regarding partnership requests and speculative projects,
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.540]   unfortunately, I'm going to have to pass.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:57.900]   I'm forcing myself to turn down new opportunities
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.100]   so I can stay focused on my research and publishing
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.020]   projects.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.620]   I'm honored that many people want to do business with me,
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.460]   but my capacity is limited for the foreseeable future.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.100]   Thanks for thinking of me.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.500]   Regarding speaking engagements, in general, I
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.380]   avoid travel as much as possible.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.120]   I have young children at home, and my wife
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.460]   runs a business as well.
[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:18.260]   So travel is very disruptive for all of us.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:21.060]   Thanks for thinking of me, and I hope you have a great event.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.300]   Regarding feedback on business ideas,
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.460]   I do not provide personalized business advice at this time.
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:28.140]   Understanding your business, industry,
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.060]   and personal objectives well enough to provide useful advice
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.020]   isn't a five-minute endeavor.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:36.780]   I would like to say that about financial planning as well.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:38.460]   Continuing, and I have more requests
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.220]   than is possible to accommodate.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.580]   In the interest of preserving capacity for research
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.480]   and publishing, I'm not able to provide individual feedback
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.020]   on your business or idea.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.580]   Thanks for understanding.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.540]   Regarding blurbs, recommendations,
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:52.900]   and endorsements, I only mention or recommend
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.900]   resources I've personally used.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.540]   If you have a resource you think I'd find interesting,
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.900]   send me the link via Twitter, and I'll check it out
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:01.300]   as capacity permits.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.940]   No need to follow up.
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.460]   Regarding book review requests, in general, I
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:07.380]   enjoy receiving new books to review,
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.000]   but I'm unable to guarantee your book will be reviewed.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.820]   If you have a book you'd like me to look at,
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.620]   there's no need to contact me first.
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:15.380]   Send it here to this address.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.960]   Books and resources provided will not
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.300]   be returned and become the property of blah, blah, blah,
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:19.940]   blah, blah.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.980]   To main editorial integrity and prevent conflicts of interest,
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.340]   all reviews are non-paid and are provided only
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.620]   when a particular book is worth reviewing.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.780]   Is it just me, or is that not awesome?
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.820]   You have so many people in the world that are saying,
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:36.980]   look at me, look at me here.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.660]   Come hire me.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.340]   Come look at me.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.420]   Come see me.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.260]   I'm certainly in that phase of life,
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.600]   trying to say, come look at me.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.340]   Come check out what I'm doing.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.900]   If I can talk to you, if I can help, I can promote my stuff.
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.020]   And here's someone who says, you know what?
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.820]   I've achieved the things I want to achieve,
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.180]   and right now I'm staying at home
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.420]   and I'm taking care of my kids and I'm
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.780]   working on the projects that I think are important.
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.500]   And what does more money do you?
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:58:59.540]   Where do you need to go?
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.300]   If you have enough income coming in, which he does,
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.540]   it's clear from his blog post.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.260]   Go and read them.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.060]   I recommend them.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.840]   It's clear that he has enough income coming in
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.860]   to maintain his lifestyle.
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.340]   What do you want?
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.140]   And still save some.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.100]   What do you want more than that?
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.820]   What on earth are you going to buy more than that,
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.380]   that you need more money than that?
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:19.020]   So follow your hunches and just kind of explore things
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.380]   and see where they lead.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:24.500]   And I commend his site to you.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.940]   11, 12, and 13, we're going to wrap up quickly here.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.500]   Number 11, run your life like a business.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.820]   And in this sense, this can mean two things.
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.820]   This can mean two ways.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.700]   Number one, it can be on the financial side.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:39.220]   And I think that that is a really valuable financial tip.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.300]   Run your life, your financial life, like a business.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.020]   However, in this case, I mean more than that.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:51.700]   Run your life like a business and get a sense of detachment.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:56.220]   So consider, OK, Joshua, if you were advising you,
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.180]   how would you advise yourself?
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.860]   And it sounds so dumb, but to me, that helps me a ton.
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.420]   If you were sitting across the table,
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.020]   and somebody was telling you this, this, this, this, this,
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.700]   what would you tell them to do?
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.860]   And somehow kind of get yourself in that idea
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:12.420]   of being the CEO of your life, of running your life
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.180]   like a business, thinking things through, doing projections,
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.540]   doing analysis, doing due diligence,
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.260]   carefully considering time, resources, money, energy,
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.260]   lifestyle, what the business is doing.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.300]   Consider the highest and best purpose.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.020]   Consider the speculative things that you
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.380]   do want to explore, because there
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.700]   may be great opportunities.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.100]   And run your life like a business,
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:32.660]   and you get a sense of detachment.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.220]   You get away from that being scared all the time.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:42.540]   Number 12, recognize the fact and appreciate the fact
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.180]   every day or as often as possible
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.740]   that we live in an amazing world, an amazing world.
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.380]   Consider the lifestyle that we can live today.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.460]   This has never been possible in the history of the world.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.860]   Consider the fact that some of these people,
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.900]   these online personalities that I've mentioned to you,
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.540]   they can live anywhere in the world and run a business.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.260]   100 years ago, you had to be the sultan of Brunei.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.580]   I think that's still a country.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.260]   You had to be the sultan of Brunei.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.540]   And even then, you can go away for six months,
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.300]   and you've got to come back.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.460]   Otherwise, you're going to have a military coup that's
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.500]   going to overthrow you.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.960]   You couldn't do that kind of thing.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.220]   You had to be so vastly wealthy to go and travel.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:25.700]   And you had to maintain your business at home with letters,
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.380]   or I guess telegrams, 2014, 1914.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.700]   Telegrams, phone calls at that point.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.660]   So just consider the world that we live in,
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.500]   that you can be anywhere in the world.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.700]   And I have no idea where Robbie is,
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.340]   who sent me this tweet today.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.060]   But he could be in West Palm Beach, Florida,
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.820]   next door to me, or he could be on the other side of the world.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.980]   I have no idea.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.180]   What an amazing world.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.700]   What an amazing opportunity.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.660]   What an amazing gift of the fact that if you're listening to me,
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.620]   it's very likely that you're living in a place
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.380]   where you probably can't fail.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:00.260]   Why would you not go for the things that you want to go for?
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.140]   So what?
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.340]   So it doesn't work out.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.980]   What an amazing opportunity that we have.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.420]   Consider the careers that you can have.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.140]   Consider the fact that you can do work that's interesting.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.900]   You can do work that's enjoyable.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:18.300]   You can do work that you really find a spark of creativity in.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.100]   And compare that to the drudgery that so many people in the world
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:24.060]   today still live under.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.100]   So many people in the world all through history have lived under.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.220]   Recognize that fact and start from that place of abundance
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.180]   of what an amazing world we live in.
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.700]   The poorest person among us has a pretty good life.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.980]   Incidentally, Joshua's tip, if you're a poor person in Chicago,
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.700]   come to Florida.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.940]   It's a lot better weather down here.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:49.500]   Number-- I don't understand why there's homeless people in Chicago.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.140]   I digress.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:53.340]   Number 13, finally, read.
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:58.020]   And if I have to say that anything else has served me well
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.660]   and that I would continue to encourage my 18-year-old self to do is read.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.780]   Read, read, read.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:09.500]   Because your ability to see through mistakes
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.340]   and to avoid some of the big errors that can happen
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:17.940]   is going to be based upon, I guess, your exposure and your mentors.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:23.660]   And the reality is, however, that you can be mentored by anybody
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:28.100]   that you want to be mentored by that you really respect and admire.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.060]   If you really respect them and admire them
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.100]   and they're a close acquaintance to you, just go and talk to them.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.300]   And they won't need to have written a book.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.020]   But usually, if it's somebody farther away from you
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.100]   that you respect and admire, they've probably written a book.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.540]   So you could go and be mentored by all 44 presidents of the United States
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:47.100]   of America.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.980]   Every one of them has some kind of book that was written by them
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:56.060]   or some kind of book or many, many books that was written about them.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.900]   And both of them are valuable.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.340]   So if you admire Barack Obama and you want to be mentored by him,
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.180]   go read his books and then read the books that are written about him.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:08.340]   And wait a few years and after his political life is done,
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.020]   then go read those books.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.900]   If you admire George Bush, go read his book.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.260]   If you admire Bill Clinton, you go back all the way back.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.620]   And go and read their books.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.980]   If you admire the great business leaders or the great humanitarian leaders
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.900]   or these great people, go read their books.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.580]   Read their blogs, especially today.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.540]   That's the other thing.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.340]   And you can choose anybody in the world to be mentored by.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.900]   What an amazing opportunity that we have.
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.900]   And then go watch their TED Talks.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.940]   Go on YouTube.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.420]   Just get exposed to great ideas.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:44.060]   And that type of knowledge, that type of education, in my mind,
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.220]   there's nothing better.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.460]   That will pay off in spades.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.020]   The return on investment for the cost of a book--
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:56.900]   I used to hear Jim Rohn used to say, just paraphrasing here,
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.140]   which I highly recommend.
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.580]   What a great man he was.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.380]   But Jim Rohn used to say, rich people all have libraries in their house.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.860]   Now here's the question.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.860]   Did they have a library before they were rich?
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.820]   Or did they get rich first and then get a library?
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.940]   I'll let you figure that out for the day.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.060]   So with that, that's my show for today.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:21.020]   Kind of a little bit different and a little bit looser, a little bit more fun.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.660]   These are just some ideas that I've had.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:24.740]   And I'm sure if I were to make this list tomorrow,
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.700]   there would be 13 other things.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.540]   Same thing for you.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.780]   These are just things that I was thinking about today
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.300]   with regard to my life circumstance.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.580]   I hope they're helpful to you.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.380]   I hope you enjoyed them.
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.380]   I love the feedback.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.820]   Thank you for those of you interacting on Twitter.
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.420]   Keep in comment.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.860]   I'm going to keep asking questions.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:43.180]   And I think on Friday, probably, I will put together--
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.980]   I've got some other good, great questions.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.740]   I'll put together a Q&A show going into a lot of other topics.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:52.140]   So if you would like to be a part of that, please shoot us a tweet at--
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.980]   tweet me @radicalpf.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:56.400]   And let me know what you're interested in my talking about.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.860]   Let me know what your question is.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.220]   Please, if you haven't done so, come by the blog
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.020]   and sign up for the email newsletter.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.400]   Sign up for the email newsletter.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.580]   It's only going to be used to publish posts
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.540]   with information on the show notes.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.620]   So you can find out when the show is published.
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.580]   When I hit Publish and the show is published,
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.900]   that email goes out within 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.580]   So you'll know that the show is live.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.300]   And you'll know what the show notes are, so you know the show topic.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.460]   Really appreciate that.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.940]   And thank you so much for those of you who were helping me
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.700]   with the show promotion.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.500]   I appreciate it.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.800]   It means the world to me that you would put a tweet out there,
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.640]   tell somebody about the show.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.880]   That means the world to me.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.600]   I just-- I thank you so much.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.640]   So with that, go live your dream.
