[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.200]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 16.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:41.240]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets,
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.600]   and today is Wednesday, July 9, 2014. Today's topic is,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180]   What advice would I have given to a person who is in a financial crisis?
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.460]   What advice would I have given to the 18-year-old me, knowing what I now know?
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.000]   I've got 13 different pieces of advice here. Stay with us if you're interested.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.180]   So today was a busy day for me as I record this. It's late in the evening,
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.820]   and hopefully we'll get this out as soon as possible. But usually I try to record the
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.060]   show in the morning. But today was a busy day. I had a lot of appointments and wasn't able to
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.160]   get through them. So I'm going to try to record this in the morning.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.920]   So I was, and I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to do the show on today.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.000]   There are lots of meaty topics that I could dig into, but yesterday was pretty deep,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.620]   pretty meaty. Hopefully y'all enjoyed it. Hopefully you were able to dig through it and
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.020]   gain some good tax planning advice that would be helpful, or at least the basics of understanding
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.000]   how to approach tax planning advice that would be helpful for you in the future.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.680]   But those types of shows take a long time to prepare. I mean, what is that? Yesterday's show
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.600]   was like an hour and 40 minutes, I think. And the preparation time of getting my notes lined up,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.900]   getting an outline, trying to think, is this going to make sense? Pretty challenging.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.780]   So today I certainly didn't have the time to do a long show like that,
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.660]   and was considering what I wanted to do. Had a couple of show topics and got on Twitter this
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.340]   morning and started talking and mentioning and saying, what do you want to ask a financial
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.540]   planner? And so I got a couple of interesting, I got a couple of interesting responses back
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.980]   and really enjoyed that. But one of the questions that I thought was super fun came on Twitter.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.500]   The Twitter handle for the person is at RobbiePC30. I guess a man named Robbie. And Robbie,
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.960]   thanks for the question. He reached out to me and his tweet back to me. And by the way,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.980]   if you're interested in being a part of the Twitter conversation, the Twitter handle for
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.640]   the show is at RadicalPF. So at RadicalPF, PF for personal finance. And then my personal Twitter
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.960]   handle is at Joshua Sheets, Sheets with an A, S-H-E-E-S. And then my personal Twitter handle is
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.060]   at Joshua Sheets. So at Joshua Sheets. Follow us either way. Both of them are me. I just imagine
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.480]   that the show one will be show topics and me. You'll get a lot of other stuff as well if you're
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.840]   interested. So feel free to follow either place. So Robbie tweets back to me and says,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.300]   knowing what you know today, what financial advice would you have given your 18-year-old self?
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.200]   Doesn't just have to be financial. So a topic like that, how's that for a setup? How's that
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.940]   for a fun topic for somebody to go back and think? What would you have told you?
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.580]   What would you have told your 18-year-old self? And as it happens, the interesting thing is that I
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:30.240]   have wanted to create an essay written basically entitled Advice for a High School Junior,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.820]   because I've got some ideas on what a high school junior should do. I'm not going to go through that
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.560]   today, but I've got some specific topics and some specific financial ideas that I think would be
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.840]   interesting for a high school junior to pursue. And although I could do that,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.760]   I'm not going to focus on that. But I had prepared some of that stuff in an essay in the past,
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.440]   but I struggled to write well. I've learned that there's actually a learning style. I don't remember
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.940]   the name for it, but there's a learning style. I think it's called a verbal learner. And I actually
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.000]   learn well by speaking. And so it's one of the reasons why I'm doing a podcast and not writing
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.660]   essays. But I learn really well by speaking. And so it's a lot easier for me to sit down and say,
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.680]   what would I tell an 18-year-old me? So I've got 13 things here that I would tell an 18-year-old
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.100]   me. And they are all related to finances, but there's not an IRA or the instruction to really
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.660]   save money anywhere here. And the reason for that is because I think one of the things I've learned
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.820]   is that the technical stuff, it's important. And as you can see, we're going deep into the
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.220]   technical knowledge. But does that stuff really make a difference? It does, but it doesn't make
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.080]   nearly as big of a difference as some other things. So today's show is going to be light,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.520]   fun, and fast. We're going to talk through Joshua's 13 pieces
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.100]   of advice for the 18-year-old self. And let's see how it goes. So number one,
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.400]   Joshua, don't be scared of people. Or Robbie, don't be scared of people. Or whomever. If I
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.740]   were talking to an 18-year-old me, I would say, don't be scared of people. Everyone else is just
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:12.120]   about like you. And this one was a tough lesson for me. Because we all want to be liked. We all
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.360]   want to be accepted to some degree. And so we wind up trying to please people. And when we're
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.520]   trying to please people, we wind up, I don't know, I think we wind up with a lot of fear.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.320]   Where does this come from? I don't know. Sometimes I wonder about the way that our social structure
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.020]   works. I wonder about school. It seems to me like the social environment that we're raised in,
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.320]   specifically speaking to my experience in the United States, is, you know, starts out good.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.640]   It's pretty easy when you're a little kid. Gets pretty awful in middle school and high school.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.200]   And then it gets better as you go on, whether college and into the work world. And if you think about
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.220]   all of the social pressure that comes at people, the clicks, the groups, the peer pressure that
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.080]   comes, you know, it seems like elementary school, the early years of elementary school, the way
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.340]   our society is structured are pretty low-key and pretty easy. By the way, we're on the topic. This
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.080]   has never made sense to me. So I'll share it with you. And if you can tell me why it's like this and
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.660]   why we continue this system, you let me know. But we start off in elementary school. And we start
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.420]   off in elementary school. And it's pretty good. You know, kindergarten is pretty fun. First grade,
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.040]   pretty fun. Second grade, pretty fun. And then we start off in elementary school. And we start off
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.760]   in second grade, pretty fun. Somewhere towards that later part of elementary school or middle
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.340]   school, it seems like the social dynamic changes. And it seems like if you're a middle school kid,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.160]   you're well acquainted with the idea of clicks and groups and the cool kids and the not-so-cool
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.380]   kids. And you're well acquainted with where you fit in that social structure. And then in high
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.120]   school, does it get worse or better? I don't know. It's pretty bad for some people and pretty great
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.820]   for others. So if you are a socially successful person, high school is probably pretty great.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.180]   An unsuccessful person socially, not very popular. High school may be pretty tough.
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.580]   And then it seemed to me when I went to college, it seemed like in college you had this first
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.860]   opportunity for people to finally be who they wanted to be and kind of live how they wanted
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.780]   to live. And it seems like in college when you're not put together in such a crazy environment like
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.920]   middle school and high school were, that you can kind of finally find your group. And you can find
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.340]   out, wow, there's other people just like me. Then you get to adulthood. And in adulthood, you have
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.080]   freedom of choice. So you have a complete freedom of choice with who to hang out with, who to be with,
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.660]   who to work with. So school seems like this crazy artificial environment where you're kind of pushed
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.300]   into this forced socialization, if you can call it that. And again, some people really have a great
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.820]   time in school. Some people don't. That was probably pretty middle of the road. I didn't
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.540]   have a horrible time, but it also wasn't the best years of my life. So it's this totally
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.560]   artificial environment. And unlike being an adult where you get to choose who you're
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.440]   with, choose who you hang out with, choose who you work with, which by the way, we all have a choice
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.580]   in who we work with, no matter how difficult the situation. You don't get that choice. You're kind
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.460]   of forced. Parents and the school and the government says you got to be in this environment.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:08.180]   As an adult, you get to change your circumstances. You get to learn. And I feel like I'm just now
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:16.400]   learning. I'm just now learning really not to be scared of people. And it sounds silly, and
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.760]   not to, I don't know, namby-pamby, even that. Look at that, socialization. Hopefully that's not too
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.780]   crazy to admit it, but it seems like everyone is scared of other people. And whether that's,
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.420]   you know, you're trying to reach out to somebody to sell somebody, you know, on your new product
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.980]   or your new idea, you're scared what people will think, you're scared what people will say.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.760]   I mean, just don't be scared of people. And the thing I've learned doing financial planning,
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.140]   which has been so interesting, and I don't know if I could, I probably could have learned it
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.240]   in another way, but I learned it doing financial planning, is that when you sit down and you
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.580]   talk with people about their goals and their dreams every day, you quickly find that everyone
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.720]   has just about the same goals and dreams. It's remarkable when you start talking to people.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.600]   And whether that's the, you know, the things like, well, if you don't own a house, many people want
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.680]   to own a house. If you don't have kids, many people want to have kids. If you're not married,
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.520]   many people want to get married. These are kind of common goals. If you want to get a promotion
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.220]   at work, they want to make more money. But then there are the bigger picture goals. And who was
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.800]   Zig Ziglar? I used to listen. I used to love listening to Zig Ziglar, which incidentally,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:26.640]   Zig Ziglar was actually my first podcast. I learned podcasting. I started listening to podcasts back in
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.480]   2007 when I found the Zig Ziglar. I don't even remember what the name of it was. I haven't
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.520]   listened to it in a long time, but it was like inspiring others or something like that podcast.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:43.420]   And it was his company started releasing some of Zig's motivational materials online for free.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.620]   And that opened my eyes to the world of podcasting.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.440]   Which was for me an amazing experience because since then, I mean, I've consumed a lot of
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.840]   podcasts and now I'm trying to contribute to it. But I owe a debt of gratitude to Zig for a lot
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.100]   of things. But I used to listen to Zig Ziglar seminars, which I highly recommend. If you can
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.300]   find them, go look on eBay. You can probably find them. But I used to listen to all of his seminars
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.440]   and Zig would say that basically everybody wants just about the same things. And I think it was
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.760]   eight things. He would say that people want to be happy. People want to, everyone wants to be
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:22.960]   happy. Everyone wants to be healthy. Everybody wants to be at least reasonably prosperous.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:29.900]   Everybody wants to be secure. Everybody wants to have friends. Everybody wants to have peace of
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.920]   mind. Everybody wants to have good family relationships. And everybody wants to have hope.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:41.140]   Hope that the future is going to be better than the past. Those were his eight categories. I don't
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.840]   know if he made them up or if he learned them or what, but those have stuck with me because I heard
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.600]   him say that so many times.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.680]   Everybody wants to be happy, healthy, reasonably prosperous, secure, have friends,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.760]   peace of mind, good family relationships, and hope that the future is going to be better than the
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.480]   past. And so incidentally, look on YouTube or excuse me, iTunes. What do you find with all
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.860]   these podcasts? There's a podcast on happiness. There's a podcast on health. I'm creating a
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:12.140]   podcast on how to be reasonably prosperous. There are podcasts on security, although security
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.440]   branches, you know, connects in my mind to financial planning and in a large degree,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:23.800]   but although not, you know, security may be things like faith, eternal security, those types of
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.040]   things, just this sense of security. Everybody wants to have friends. There's podcasts on
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.840]   communication, on leadership, peace of mind, good family relationships. There's marriage podcasts,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.000]   and then there's hope. Those are kind of the inspirational podcasts, and that kind of cuts
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.600]   across so many different categories. But everybody wants the same thing. And so for some reason,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.280]   you know, I don't know. I just feel like I spent a lot of my life
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.940]   being scared of people, not for anything specific. No one's ever hurt me. I'm a pretty big guy. I've
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.280]   never been in a fight. But so there's just kind of this idea that we're scared of what our parents
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.360]   are going to think. You know, if we follow our dreams, if we drop out of college, if we go to
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.380]   college, we're scared of what, and this affects every area of life. We're just kind of scared of
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:09.640]   what people will think. And so I'm pretty pleased. You know, I think I've learned this, but you know,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.120]   I've still got a ways to learn. Frankly, it's still, it's scary for me to do a podcast because you
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.720]   lose your anonymity, and now you're pushed out there on the front lines, kind of telling your
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.420]   ideas, and you're on the record. So now somebody can come, and just like I do to other people,
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:29.300]   somebody can come, take my words, and take issue with them. And so that's scary. But I would just
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:34.860]   say, don't be scared of other people. Everyone else is just about like you. And once you realize
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.560]   that, at least for me, I found that there was an incredible freedom in that idea. That's number
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.960]   one. Number two, give up on impressing other people. You know, I still, I still
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.980]   struggle sometimes with how to balance this one. And there's kind of this, this fight, this war,
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.400]   this struggle between not just trying to impress other people, but then not necessarily trying to
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.280]   cut against other people, and not trying to
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:12.120]   needlessly offend. I think about this in the area of dress. Should you dress to impress other people?
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.660]   No. But then again,
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.220]   is there validity in the ideas of dress for success? Yeah. You know, the way that you dress
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.840]   affects how people perceive you. Should you try to look great for other people? Well, not necessarily
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:32.460]   to impress them. But then again, should you try to look great? I think you should. So,
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:39.180]   so I'm not sure how to temper this one. But basically, the idea is, is many of us kind of
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:43.580]   struggle. We want to impress people. But the thing is, is that if you go on, if I try to be impressive,
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:51.440]   sound impressive, and I try to speak about, look how impressive I am, you'd turn me off in a minute.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.060]   You'd say, this guy's a, this guy's a dum-dum. You know, he's full of himself. It's all about him.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:01.800]   It's completely arrogant. And I'm just done with it. The best way to impress other people is to be
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.560]   impressed by them. The best way to admire, to be admired is to admire other people. The best way
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.540]   to be liked is to like other people. The best way to be respected is to respect other people. I mean,
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.480]   this is the, the,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.120]   the way the world works. And so, you know, as a young person, we're so concerned, kind of
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.700]   connecting through with being scared of people. We're so concerned with impressing people. And
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.920]   then it seems as time goes on, at least I've learned, you know, no one really cares that much.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:37.980]   If you look at the people that are, are probably most admired in our society, they're usually a
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:44.320]   little bit unconventional. I always think of rock stars. You know, the rock stars are, we pay them
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.240]   lots of money and they're really unconventional. They're always looking to get attention,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.100]   but they don't get attention by fitting in. They get attention by being different.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.440]   And millions of people for a well-respected rock star will spend all of their time and all their
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.280]   money just simply admiring this person. But it's completely different. It's a free thinker and
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:07.760]   people are drawn to that. People are drawn to, the weird thing is people are drawn to being
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.800]   unconventional, unconventional. Chris Guillebeau, my favorite essay I've mentioned on the show before,
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.940]   my favorite financial planning essays that I would encourage people to read, is his essay from years
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:24.260]   ago when he first got online. He wrote an essay called the one, you know, would you rather drive
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.680]   an SUV or visit a hundred countries? And his, basically the, the gist of it is that you have
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.560]   a choice. It will cost you the same amount of money to buy an SUV as it will to visit a hundred
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:42.180]   countries. And, and if you look at that, most people just automatically buy the SUV, but yet
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.000]   who's, who, I admire.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.360]   Someone who's been to a hundred countries. To me, that's far more interesting, but it's the
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:55.680]   atypical choice. And if you just simply give up on impressing other people and live according to
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.760]   the way that, that you want to live, it seems like strangely that's actually what impresses
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.080]   other people. So give up on impressing other people by trying to fit in. More financial
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:11.140]   mistakes are made this way than, than anything else. And the weird thing is, is that you'll
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.840]   spend all the money, you'll spend all your money trying to get a job. And you'll spend all your
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.640]   money trying to impress other people and they're not impressed. But if you forget about doing that,
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.340]   people can, people will often be impressed by you no matter how much money you have. You know,
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.820]   I've never met Chris. I hear he's a great guy. I mean, he seems just like a really awesome guy.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.420]   I read a couple of his books and I've read his blog for years, but you know, frankly,
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:38.460]   he's kind of a nerdy guy and he's kind of this real soft spoken, real gentle, nerdy guy. And
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.860]   best my knowledge, I don't think he owns a car. He lives in an apartment in Portland or Seattle
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.680]   or something like that.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.600]   Not necessarily. I mean, does he have money? I don't know. I assume he does. I hope he does. He's
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.260]   got a, it seems like he's got an awesome business, got some really cool products. I hope he has a lot
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.520]   of money, but, but the, the, the value is, is that he didn't set out for that. And so the money is
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.180]   almost unnecessary. If you don't own a car, you don't need to bother with it. He's impressive
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.380]   because he went to every country in the world by the time he was 35 and started, you know,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.500]   something called the World Domination Summit. How does it get better than that? Consider,
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.520]   you know, one of my other favorite online guys I really enjoy reading is a guy named Benny Lewis.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.560]   And he writes a blog called Fluent in Three Months. If you're interested in languages,
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.360]   check it out. Highly recommended. But Benny Lewis has spent, when he returned 21 years old,
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.740]   if I remember his story correctly, he didn't, he only spoke English. And then since then,
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.960]   he's gone on to learn a dozen or two languages that he speaks with varying degrees of fluency.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.200]   And every three year, three, excuse me, three months, he embarks on another, on another,
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:43.360]   on another language learning mission. Kind of a, again, a kind of a nerdy guy, but what a cool story.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.560]   He lives on the road, travels to a new country every three months, it seems like, and has this
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.240]   awesome internet business just based upon what he's interested in. But if you go out and try to
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.840]   impress somebody down at the club, you know, I live in West Palm Beach, and you go down to Miami,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.880]   now if I'm going to go impress somebody at the club, you know, I'm going to buy a fancy,
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.040]   I don't even know the right lingo for that world. I'm going to buy a fancy car and I'm going to pull
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:13.200]   up and live the Miami lifestyle. Not that impressive. So I think just stop trying to
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:20.320]   really focus on, on just being you. And the people who are interested in what you're doing will be
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   drawn to you and they'll be impressed by you. I'm impressed. I'm interested in languages. So I'm
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.760]   impressed by Benny Lewis. But someone who's not interested doesn't, I don't care. No big deal.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.500]   Let them go on their way. I'm impressed by him. I'm impressed by Chris Gillibooks. I admire what
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.320]   he's done. Let someone else go on their way. I think it's, I think it's awesome. But I don't
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.620]   need, you don't need to worry about impressing other people. Do what you want. They'll be
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.160]   impressed if they, if they want to be.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:50.420]   Number three, don't be scared to fail. In our society, Western society, it's almost impossible
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:58.240]   to fail. Take the risk. What are you going to lose? And here's what I mean. In our, again,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   speaking to a primarily, I would assume a U.S. American or at least a Western audience,
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.680]   in the Western society, failure has a very low cost. There are almost no actual consequences
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.140]   to failing. And now in other parts of the world, that's not true. You may lose your life,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.540]   if you fail in some place. And there are certain things. I mean, if you are practicing some extreme
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:22.900]   sport and you fail at that, you may die. But I'm just talking about the things that most of us are
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.460]   scared of. How in this country, how is it possible to fail? I mean, think about this. What is the
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.340]   risk? You want to take a big trip. You want to start a business. You want to change jobs.
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.660]   What's a money failure? I mean, okay, let's say, worst case scenario, you lose all your money. Is
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.280]   it possible to fail by losing all your money? That's not failure. You run out of food. Guess
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.120]   what? There's food. You're going to lose all your money. You're going to lose all your money. You're
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:43.160]   going to lose all your money. You're going to lose all your money. You're going to lose all your money.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.560]   Food stamps or whatever they're called now, EBT, SNAP, I don't know. There's food stamps.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.240]   They'll give you money for food every month, and that's enough money to support your family. So if
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.720]   you've got three kids or four kids or five kids, you're going to have enough to feed your family.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.520]   Or if you're a single guy or gal, you're going to have enough to feed yourself. There's charities.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.480]   If you're homeless and you don't have any money, there's a charity that'll feed you.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.760]   Your mom will feed you. Your dad will feed you. I don't want to feed you forever, but
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.100]   so you're not going to run out of food. You're not going to starve. Now, there's some place in the
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.540]   world where you are. There's places in the world where you're starving right now, but I would assume
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:21.880]   that if you're hearing my voice, you're not in that situation. And we need to work to help people
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.540]   in those situations. But in the U.S., come on. You're not going to run out of food. Are you going
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.160]   to be homeless? You're not going to be homeless. There's Section 8 housing assistance. The
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:35.360]   government will stick you in a place to live. There's housing charities. My favorite thing on
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.880]   housing, I just think one of my favorite movies I've always enjoyed, which should be probably
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.080]   pretty obvious why, is Pursuit of Happiness, the story of
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:51.660]   Will Smith portrayed Chris Gardner, who started a large financial firm, which was sold, which was
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.300]   sold, which was sold, which always happens with financial firms. But a guy in the filming of the
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:02.100]   movie, he's sleeping in a subway bathroom. But so what? He's not out in the cold. He's sleeping in
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.600]   a subway bathroom. One of the things I think about, okay, you lose everything if you have a car. Live
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.100]   in your car. Is it so bad? Well, to one person, it's bad. To another person, it's an adventure.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.060]   Go online. Find somebody who's living in the cold.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.340]   And again, hopefully, I mean, you can get a minivan. Minivan is the ideal car to live in if
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.720]   you're trying to live cheap. Is it really so bad? I don't know. Look at it as an adventure.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:33.100]   I remember a story that has stuck out to me about, I think the author was Tynan,
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:42.500]   who writes an interesting blog over at Tynan, T-Y-N-A-N.com, Tynan.com. And he lives in an RV.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.000]   And his RV story is kind of interesting. He moved from a big fancy condo into an RV and read his
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.260]   essays on it. It's rather interesting. But he lives in an RV by choice. Not that he can't live
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:58.000]   somewhere else. He chooses to live in a small RV. And I think if I'm citing the story correctly,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.500]   I'll have to Google it when I'm done. But if I'm citing the story correctly, he's parked on the
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.500]   street one day and he comes out of his RV and he looks across the street and there's another RV.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.980]   And the guy on the other side is coming out of his RV too. So he walks over and he says,
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.960]   hey, man, how are you doing? Guy responds,
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:19.460]   how's it look like I'm doing? I'm living in an RV. And I think Tynan says, come on, man.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.960]   And he didn't know what to say because by him, living in an RV was awesome. It's an awesome
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:34.480]   lifestyle. So I just thought, wow, what a difference of perspective makes. So things
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.800]   like that, just viewing the struggle, it can be part of the adventure. You're not going to fail.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.000]   You run out of money, guess what? They'll give you cash payments. Well, welfare cash
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.040]   assistance programs or whatever it's got. I don't remember what the formal name of it is.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:52.440]   Is it going to be a lot? No. Is it going to be enough? Probably. Why on earth would you go
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.480]   enslave in a job when you can build a business? If you want to build a business or if you have a
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.680]   dream, why would you not go and follow that? And all this stuff is there. Take it. Use it.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:09.040]   That's what it's there for. Somebody's going to get it. Why not you? Medical care? Obamacare.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.820]   Medicaid. Medicaid was massively expanded in the last couple of years.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.060]   You can walk into any hospital in the country, and if your leg is bleeding, they will take you in,
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.140]   and they will fix you. They'll give you a cell phone if you don't make any money. So you can
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:28.240]   run your business. If you want to start a business, and you fail, and you run out of all your money,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.620]   and you get kicked out of your apartment, and you're behind on your bills, you can go down.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.940]   You can live in Section 8 housing. You can get an internet connection from the coffee shop next door
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:42.960]   and get a $200 Chromebook to run your business on. They'll give you a cell phone,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.160]   to pay, and some money for food, and start your business. I mean,
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.600]   I wouldn't say that would be the primary thing, but I guess a lot of my life, you're always just
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:00.420]   worried about failure. Oh, go into debt. Okay, so you go into debt. All right, you can't pay it.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:07.380]   Well, don't pay it. You get behind on your bills. There's lots of people that have gotten behind on
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.940]   their bills. So don't pay it. Run your household on cash. Change your phone number. Worst case
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:18.200]   of course, you can't pay your bills. Declare bankruptcy. You borrowed a bunch of money on
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.720]   student loans, which aren't bankruptable. Well, go into the black market. I mean, the drug dealers
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.940]   figure out how to live. The illegal immigrants figure out how to live. Figure it out. The thing
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:36.900]   that is driving us is the fear of failure is not usually a rational fear. Again, you're not going
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:42.580]   to fail. What is failure? You're going to die? You're not going to die. What the actual fear of failure is,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:49.800]   is the actual fear of failure is a mental construct. It's a fear of looking foolish. It's a fear of
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:57.440]   losing, of other people lowering their opinions. It's a mental game. Now, do I think that you
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.420]   should do all those things? Well, actually I do if you're using it for something. If I had my way,
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.600]   I'd snap my fingers and eliminate all of them. But guess what? No one's electing me president.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.900]   I'd eliminate all those programs, and I'd keep it in the hands of private charities. But no
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:20.880]   one's asking me. And no matter how I vote, it doesn't seem to change anything. So I say I can't
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.460]   do anything about the national situation, but I can do something about my life. And so if worse
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:31.500]   comes to worse and I fail, that's what it's there for. And if worse comes to worse and you fail,
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.680]   that's what it's there for. You're not going to die. And then the other thing is that if you look
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.080]   at it, so failure, fear of failure. I'll use the example of starting a business. Fear of failing
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.880]   because we're going to start a business. Well, there's not going to be a business that's going to
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:50.140]   under the scenario I just laid out. There's no rational fear of dying. So then it's a mental fear
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:57.200]   of taking charity, of being dependent, of being on the dole. Again, I'm kind of against all those
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:03.400]   things. I'm a card-carrying libertarian, but about as far out on the kooky political fringe as
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   possible. But it exists. Why not use it if you have to? So you say, okay, well, then it's a fear
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.860]   of looking foolish. Well, is your mom going to love you less because you started a business?
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:20.440]   And you lose all your money? Is your best friend not going to go have a drink with you because you
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:26.080]   started a business and you went bankrupt? I mean, in this country, the bankruptcy laws are the most
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.820]   amazing thing ever. Consider who to consider. I mean, there's dozens of examples. Consider,
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:37.680]   you know, Donald Trump was a bill. Go read his book, The Art of the Deal. A billion dollars in
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.840]   debt. A billion dollars negative net worth. A billion dollars negative net worth. A billion
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:51.260]   dollars. And he turned it around. And the financial, and the financial, Dave Ramsey,
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.600]   okay, in the financial world, I guarantee, you know, some of you listen to Dave Ramsey.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.420]   What did Dave Ramsey do? Okay, starts a business, fails at it, does some dumb stuff with his
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.420]   financing, gets dumb, does dumb stuff, declares bankruptcy, and starts all over again. And today
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:11.140]   makes millions of dollars every year with one of the highest rated radio shows in the country,
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.820]   plus all of his other
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:19.680]   83 different lines of income. He's an amazing business guy. There's other 83 lines of income
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.360]   coming into his company. And, you know, the whole thing is based upon, you know, I declared bankruptcy.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.440]   I was stupid, so let me tell you how stupid I was and how not to be stupid. I mean, it's laughable.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.920]   And yet here's the American dream. Goes deeply into debt. Can't pay it off. Declares bankruptcy.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:42.740]   Starts afresh. And today makes millions of dollars a year teaching people how not to
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.780]   borrow money, how not to do what he did. But yet what did he do? He declared bankruptcy and wiped
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:54.480]   away his debts and started afresh. So, I mean, I'm not, I mean, he's a great guy. I have lots of
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.100]   issues with him, but, I mean, he does, he's done an amazing amount of good for a lot of people.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.020]   But the reality is, is that he is a financial advisor, or he's not, he's not a financial
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:11.140]   advisor. He is a financial entertainer who his entire business is based upon his history of
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.780]   failing. And yet today, he's a financial entertainer. And he's a financial entertainer. And
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.640]   today, there are millions and millions and millions of people across this country who look
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:24.140]   up to him and appreciate the work that he does. So, if, who defines failure? Is failure, you know,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:30.700]   an event? Is failure winning? Or is failure quitting? There are a lot of people who go to
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.540]   the Olympics and only three of them get a medal. But are they now not Olympians because they didn't
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:39.260]   win? Winning is a stupid definition of success. I mean, well, I guess it depends on how you define
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.760]   winning. But not everyone's going to come out on top. So, you get to define success. And you get
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.860]   to define failure. You know, Zig, Zig, back to Zig Ziglar. My favorite quote of his. I can hear
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:53.420]   his voice. I can't do a southern drawl. But here's what he'd say over and over again. And it's my
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:29:01.620]   favorite saying to say to myself. Failure is an event. It's not a person. Yesterday really did
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:10.160]   end last night. Today is a brand new day. And it's yours. You know, again, I wish I could do
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.740]   his southern drawl. Or I should go find a recording of him. But, you know, I wish I could
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:20.620]   failure is an event. It's not a person. Yesterday did end last night. Done. Gone. Today is a brand
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:28.640]   new day. It's yours. So I just say study the worst that can happen and be okay with it. I think one
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.560]   of the particularly useful tips in Tim Ferriss's book, For Our Work Week, and I think this is
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:41.600]   key, is consider the worst-case-possible scenario that could happen under a course of action.
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.600]   And then ask yourself if you're willing to accept it if it happens. And then work like
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:54.100]   crazy to make sure it doesn't happen. So if the worst-case scenario of, again, worst-case
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.380]   scenario for me, you know, changing, leaving the business that I had and changing to some
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:06.940]   new ventures, primarily this podcast. Okay, so I walk away from a business. I lose all my clients.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.960]   I lose all my money. I wind up, you know, going deeply in debt. I wind up bankrupt.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.460]   I don't plan for that to happen. I work pretty hard to make sure it doesn't happen. But let's say I spend
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:22.200]   all my money and I go wind up bankrupt. Guess what? I can start again. And I'm willing to deal with
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:32.540]   that because I fear the pain of regret more than I fear the pain of failure, the pain of bankruptcy,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.980]   or the pain of a business closing. There's businesses that close every day. Walt Disney,
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.020]   what did he go bankrupt three times on his way to starting Disney World? But you don't remember him
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.900]   for his bankruptcy. You don't remember him for his bankruptcy. You don't remember him for his
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.500]   bankruptcy. Again, Dave Ramsey, bankrupt? Yes. But you don't know him today for his bankruptcy.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.460]   There are lots and lots of people that have failed. I don't remember what the numbers are. I could look
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.760]   them up, but we won't worry with actual numbers today. Lots of people have failed. So study the
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.360]   worst that could happen and be okay with it. And the other thing I've learned is that no matter
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.460]   what the worst case scenario is, there's a way to make it really good. I remember this when I worked
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:11.620]   with a prospective client who the, my actual client was a family member of this person. And
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.700]   they referred me to the family member and said, hey, maybe you can meet with this person and help
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.860]   them. So I meet with them. And what I find out is the person has no money and they're living on
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:28.700]   social security disability. But yet the person is living on a sailboat. And here in West Palm
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.440]   Beach and part of the year in the Caribbean, I thought, what an awesome, awesome example of
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.760]   taking what some people would say is a really awful lifestyle. I'm living on social security
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.340]   disability and figuring out how to make what the law says. And I'm living on social security
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.980]   What a lot of people would say is a really awesome lifestyle out of it.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:49.920]   I remember a friend of mine had a friend who would come,
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.640]   and this person would come down to Florida,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.840]   and this person was a really great gentleman, an elderly gentleman,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.860]   kind of the big bearded mountain man that you'd run into at a folk music festival.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.020]   And this person lived in his car, and he lived in a van,
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.080]   and he lived on, again, Social Security, I think.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.720]   It was a very small Social Security payment.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.460]   But he would come down, and my friend would let him park in his yard,
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.480]   and he would have a free place to stay every winter in Florida in the winter,
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.240]   and he'd go up to New England in the summer.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.460]   How's that for a great way to make a great life?
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.720]   Now, I don't particularly want to live in a van,
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.700]   or at least I don't particularly want to live in a van with a large family.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.660]   One person, that might be cool.
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:34.080]   But the reality is that it's a lot better than slaving away in a cubicle nation.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.700]   So you can make any situation fun if you learn the skills of how to do that.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.540]   I think of the early retirement extreme book,
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.940]   which I highly recommend if you haven't read it, buy it, and read it.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.980]   But you've got Jacob, who talked about how he lived, I think,
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.760]   it was $7,000 a year of expenses,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.380]   even though he had plenty of money that he could spend,
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.980]   and with skills, supplanted the need for the high income.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.580]   So that's the key.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.080]   Which brings us on to number four,
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.420]   which my piece of advice number four is study skills that actually matter.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.920]   How important is it, really,
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.260]   in the age of Google,
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.720]   to be able to name exactly what the capital of every country in the world is?
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.840]   Not that important.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.500]   But how important is it to know how to have successful relationships?
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.940]   Pretty important.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.600]   How important is it to have communication skills?
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.020]   Pretty important.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.140]   How important is it to understand finance?
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.900]   Pretty important.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.220]   How important is it to have skills of creativity,
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.180]   and ideation, like the ability to come up with new ideas?
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.980]   That's pretty important.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:48.160]   How about the skills of how to make stuff, build stuff, create stuff?
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.420]   How about studying things, creating success skills?
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.000]   Those things are pretty important.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.840]   And all of those things are really, really learnable.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.260]   Our society is so crazy.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.840]   We talk about skills constantly in our world.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.200]   We talk about skills like how to keep an empty inbox at work,
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.100]   inbox zero, right?
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.400]   We talk about how to keep an empty inbox at work,
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.640]   super useful, do my best to do it, fail a lot of the times,
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.780]   but super useful.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.340]   But what about skills like building your own house?
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.840]   I read an essay one time, I'd love to find it,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.140]   but thought, what a great idea.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.100]   But the essay was advice for, I think it was a high school student,
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.120]   and the advice was basically, don't go to college,
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.580]   I mean, unless you want to go to college,
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.960]   but the advice was essentially, consider another way.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.040]   Consider, instead of going to college, consider going into the trades,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.920]   and learning how to work in some of the trades,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.300]   and learning how to build stuff.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.380]   Go and work in some of the trades,
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.760]   work in construction, work in various aspects of construction,
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.260]   hire yourself out at minimum wage as an apprentice across various trades.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:48.220]   And then, save money, live cheap, save money, work hard,
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.700]   and then buy the materials, and little by little, build your own house.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:55.800]   And the plan, I don't remember, it was mid-20s or 23 or 25 or something,
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.660]   but now you're living in a paid-for house that you built yourself,
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.980]   you don't have to deal with a mortgage payment for the rest of your life,
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.740]   and you've been able to set this up.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.180]   That's a pretty good plan.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.360]   But all of that comes from a very good plan.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.440]   All of that comes from having those skills.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.420]   Investing in skills, which is what this point,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.980]   the major point that I'm trying to make,
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.560]   investing in skills pays all kinds of dividends.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.540]   You see this all the time in the trades.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.700]   If you have friends, or if you work in the trades,
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.640]   many people have one skill.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.680]   I am an electrician.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.740]   Well, when the electrical market goes down,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.440]   you've got to have another backup skill.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.960]   You've got to have other skills that you can fall back on.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.340]   It would be really nice if you had multiple businesses,
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.820]   and you can just slide between them.
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.460]   We've replaced skills with money.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:43.160]   Back to Jacob from Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.780]   He talks a lot about that in his book.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.080]   He says that you can either choose to spend money on stuff,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.720]   or you can have the skills to do it.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.740]   And either is right or wrong, in my opinion.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.580]   If you want to spend your money and hire a person to do that, that's great.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.020]   There's lots of things I don't like doing,
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.300]   and I'd rather hire someone to do.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.380]   But then again, if you don't have the money,
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.480]   or don't want to spend the money,
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.680]   replace it with the skills.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.320]   You can't take skills away.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.740]   People are all worried about half the society
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:07.920]   these days.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.620]   It's all worried about the economy blowing up,
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.800]   and the country melting into chaos,
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:21.060]   and trying to figure out what's going to save your lifestyle in that situation.
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.660]   What's going to save your lifestyle in that situation
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.940]   is exactly what's going to make you rich before that situation,
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.920]   and it's skills.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.060]   If you're a skillful, valuable person,
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.440]   and you've got a strong social network,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.720]   that's going to be incredibly valuable to you
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.300]   if you had a strong social network.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.940]   Who were the Jews that got out of Germany under Hitler?
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.140]   They were the ones that had money, yes,
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.320]   but also a lot of them that didn't have money,
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.440]   that had some kind of social support structure
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.300]   that could funnel them out of the country,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.460]   or they had connections.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.100]   Those people got out too.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.340]   So you can have connections.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.220]   You can build skills.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.840]   This is not a financial thing.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.500]   If I were talking to an 18-year-old me,
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.780]   I'd say skip Cubicle Nation.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.560]   I worked in Cubicle Nation for one year.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.420]   Sorry to steal.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.060]   What was that, Pam Slim's book, I think?
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.320]   I don't remember who the author of that book was,
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.520]   but I hope I'm not infringing on her trademark,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.780]   but skip Cubicle Nation.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.280]   There are millions of people stuck in Cubicle Nation.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.700]   Work on skills.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.280]   Again, go join a construction crew
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.200]   and learn to build houses.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.440]   Learn finance.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.060]   Learn a skill,
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.700]   and you can get out and then build a business on that.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.760]   That is what will ultimately
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.160]   really make a lot of freedom over time.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.860]   So I would just say give up on dogma
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.840]   and have an open mind.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.020]   So take the classes you enjoy.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.620]   One thing I wish I'd done differently in college
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.560]   is when I was in college,
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   I was trying to finish my degree.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.520]   I was paying for it.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.380]   I was trying to finish my degree.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.220]   So I just took courses in my degree,
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.400]   and now I look back and say,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.520]   what an awesome time that I could have had
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.600]   to sit back and just learn
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.100]   and take classes that I'm interested in,
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.520]   not because I care about the credit,
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.800]   but just go to all these classes that are offered.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.720]   That's what I love so much
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.980]   about the world we live in today.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.500]   I can go to iTunes U.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.080]   I can go to Creative Live.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.820]   I can go to Coursera.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.040]   I can go to all these places,
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.220]   and I can take these courses,
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.400]   and I've got YouTube.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.320]   I've got everything right at my fingertips
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.560]   of all the wacky things that I'm interested in,
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.140]   so I can explore things with no cost.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.000]   What an amazing world.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.040]   And the idea of exploration is
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.040]   don't set out and say,
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.480]   I'm going to make this thing work.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   The best ideas are usually probably unplanned,
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.220]   but go out and explore things.
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.720]   And don't be concerned with being right all the time.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.340]   I have made that mistake for a long time,
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.620]   is that I just want to be right,
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.320]   and these days,
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.380]   hopefully I'm learning to be done with that.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.800]   Don't worry about being right.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.080]   Be fascinated.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.240]   Be fascinated with life.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.100]   Be fascinated with other people's stories.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.820]   Be fascinated.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.340]   Financial planning,
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.200]   I've learned the hard way to have an open mind
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.780]   because I used to say and tell people
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.040]   how they should live their life.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.200]   Now I've learned
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:07.920]   hopefully,
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.340]   you have to ask someone
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.920]   that's actually worked with me to prove it,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.640]   but I've learned how to listen
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.120]   a lot better,
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.880]   and then just understand.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.340]   Again, we give a few ideas
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.000]   for after listening,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.540]   a few ideas for how I think they might
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.360]   be able to get a little closer
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.420]   to what they're trying to do.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.980]   The dogma and the closed mind on things.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.540]   I'll give you one of my personal struggles.
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:32.500]   For years,
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.540]   I picked on Dave Ramsey earlier,
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.160]   and I'm sure I'll pick on him.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:37.520]   I've picked on him a lot
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.700]   because he's the front runner.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.020]   That's what happens when you're out in the front
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:41.640]   and up on top.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.840]   I always struggled because for years
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.460]   I would listen to Dave Ramsey,
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.800]   and Dave Ramsey would preach,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.280]   don't lease a car, don't lease a car,
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.780]   don't lease a car, don't lease a car.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.500]   Buy a car, buy a car, don't lease a car.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.440]   Do I agree with him? Yeah, I do.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.020]   I've never leased a car. I don't plan to.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.960]   I don't really want to.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.200]   Then you read something like 4-Hour Workweek,
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.980]   and in Tim's book,
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.160]   you read about the process of dreamlining,
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.280]   and you say,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.820]   let's start with dreamlining.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.080]   The example he uses in there is,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.720]   let's say you want to buy an Aston Martin.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.980]   Guess what? You can go down and lease an Aston Martin
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.760]   for $1,500 a month.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.100]   That makes sense.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.520]   Really. If you had a business
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.260]   that was creating $1,500 a month,
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.040]   why is it somehow morally
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.540]   superior to wait
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.440]   until
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.280]   40 years or 30 years
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:35.900]   until you can
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.140]   sell it?
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.620]   Somehow have so much money that you've put your money in retirement
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.900]   and you can lease the Aston Martin.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:44.780]   Now, I personally am not interested in leasing an Aston Martin
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.840]   because I'm more interested in being financially independent.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.500]   I value, for me,
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.160]   I value the ability
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.740]   to be completely financially independent
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.640]   more than I value the ability
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.580]   to drive the Aston Martin.
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.080]   But I think it's a cool idea to go rent one.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.200]   Rent one for a couple of weekends and get the feeling of it.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.700]   If that's what you like to do, awesome.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.380]   Go for it.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.940]   So, you know,
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.940]   the dogma,
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.100]   the dogma of those things,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.480]   you know,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.120]   don't lease cars,
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.980]   which is fine.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.280]   You know,
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.260]   he can run his show how he wants to,
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.760]   but I'll run my show how I want to.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.980]   But that dogma,
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.760]   you know,
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.840]   winds up just kind of destroying things
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.380]   instead of saying,
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:19.940]   you know what?
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.900]   All of us,
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.780]   you know,
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.800]   we can choose to rent a car.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.600]   That's what leasing is.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.660]   It's called renting a car.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.520]   And if we want to do that and it makes sense,
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.340]   good for that.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.240]   Good for us.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.440]   You know,
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.800]   this whole idea of paying cash for businesses
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.900]   versus starting with debt.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.000]   Most people start with debt.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.080]   I don't think,
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:36.900]   I think it's,
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.540]   it's probably smarter to start with money
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.200]   and it forces to be more agile.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.180]   But guess what?
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:41.820]   Most businesses,
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.500]   I think,
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.520]   I don't know about most.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:43.980]   I shouldn't,
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.160]   I shouldn't be so loose with,
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.220]   I don't know the percentage,
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.180]   but a lot of businesses start with debt.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.180]   And,
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.580]   and so this idea that it's only done one way,
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.520]   it may be a better way.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.580]   We can sell the way,
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.300]   but this idea that it's only done one way is,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:57.880]   is damaging.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.000]   Number six,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.280]   get clear on your priorities in life.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.420]   Your priorities.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.860]   It'd be okay.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.640]   It's okay with them changing.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.080]   Understand all your options.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.920]   So much of our lives,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.660]   it seems we live according to other people's priorities.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.480]   We buy houses because other people think we should,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.720]   rather than because we want to.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.260]   We think we want to,
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.600]   but it's for other people's priorities.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.680]   And a lot of people I think would be better,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.140]   would be,
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:28.820]   would prefer.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:29.180]   I mean,
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:29.600]   if you,
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.160]   if you were to give this either or thing to me,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.780]   and let's assume that I'm single,
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.240]   so I can just do what I want to do.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:35.480]   And I,
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.280]   let's assume that,
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:36.820]   uh,
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.860]   I can do whatever I want to do.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.200]   If you give this either or to me and say,
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:41.720]   Joshua,
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:47.840]   you can buy a house and live in one town all the time and take two week
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.460]   vacations,
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.840]   or you can choose to rent and every three months go to a new place.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.720]   I would probably choose the three months if it were just me.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.400]   And I weren't,
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:56.720]   you know,
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.060]   interested in being close to family at this point,
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.140]   I've consciously chosen not to live that kind of lifestyle,
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.340]   but I think that would be awesome.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.860]   And there are a lot of other reasons why I've chosen not to do that,
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.100]   but there are people who've done that.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:06.680]   But,
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.660]   I never knew when I was 18 years old that that was even an option.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.060]   I never knew that I could do something like,
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:12.740]   let me see,
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.900]   I think the website is where is Kyle now?
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.260]   Uh,
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.300]   and this is a,
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.120]   he's a,
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:18.780]   the man,
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:19.560]   his name is Kyle.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.400]   I don't know his last name,
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.940]   but his website is where is Kyle now?
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.920]   And here you have this man named Kyle who got sick and tired of living in
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.900]   department as a web program or a computer program of some kind went and bought
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.780]   an Airstream trailer.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.800]   And for the last two,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.040]   three,
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.580]   four years,
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.300]   something like that,
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.620]   he's gone and traveled all over North America.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.800]   Staying in different places,
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   been to all 50 States,
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.860]   every province in Canada,
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.640]   something like that.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.280]   What a cool lifestyle for someone who's a web programmer.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.620]   There's people all over the place that are doing this.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.660]   There's people online.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.600]   The tropical MBA folks are all living in Thailand doing these things.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:50.980]   I've been there.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.300]   I never knew that was an option when I was 18 years old.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.440]   Well,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.040]   frankly,
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.900]   it probably wasn't an option when I was 18 years old,
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.640]   but today it is an option.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.260]   And so be,
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.120]   be aware of those,
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.420]   of,
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.540]   of all your options and then get clear on what your priorities are.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:06.700]   I live where,
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:11.840]   I live because that's where my family is and that's where I'm involved with the people and the church and the,
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.160]   and the,
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.740]   and the place that I want to be.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.840]   But a lot of people just kind of live where they grew up,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.920]   not intentionally choosing to live there.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.240]   Understand what your priorities and your options are.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.180]   Number seven,
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.840]   focus on building good habits.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:32.040]   I'm convinced that health and wealth are largely habits.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.320]   Health is not achieved in a pill.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.720]   It's achieved in having good lifestyle habits.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.160]   Wealth is not achieved in a pill.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.640]   It's achieved in having good lifestyle habits.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.960]   So the idea of spending less than you make,
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   that's a habit.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:56.580]   The idea of building your skills and your knowledge and your income,
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.380]   that's a habit.
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:03.220]   Focus on building the right habits and the end result will take care of itself.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.760]   Number eight,
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.320]   I would say to the 18 year old me,
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:06.620]   care about yourself.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:10.020]   Carefully consider your high school and college decisions,
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.420]   especially the college decision.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.280]   Consider all your options and just be careful that you don't limit your choices.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.960]   In today's world,
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.340]   there are a lot of choices and I'm going to do some,
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.700]   some shows on college and on you.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.340]   It's because you have two things that are very popular.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:31.960]   The most common still mainstream is you need to go to college so that you can get a good job and pay money.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.800]   And now it's become quite popular to say,
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.080]   well,
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:35.500]   you don't,
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.300]   you shouldn't go to college.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:36.600]   You should,
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:36.900]   you should just,
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.200]   you know,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.620]   start a business and set instead.
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.460]   I don't believe either of them are right.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.340]   And we're going to pour through some of the data.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.720]   It's very interesting.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.180]   The data,
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.260]   because education,
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.060]   formal education still has a dramatic,
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:53.060]   dramatic effect on earning potential.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:46:01.780]   And this is by far one of the best financial investments that somebody who is right for college and who's going to finish college can make.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.760]   However,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.560]   when you dig into the data and you pull out the people who don't make money,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.800]   you can't make it through college.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.680]   Then you find a very different story.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.120]   And so I would say,
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.880]   get clear on your priorities and carefully consider the college decisions.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:24.440]   For some people going to college at a mainstream four year university is going to be the perfect decision.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.120]   And for other people,
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:36.360]   the perfect decision is going to be made based upon going to iTunes University while living on the road and four in 80 different countries for four years.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.160]   And blogging your way through it.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.240]   These are not right or wrong.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.000]   They're only right or wrong if they're made hastily and not not thought out.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   But there are a lot of options and there are and that's there are a lot of options.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.280]   And I'll leave that one with that because I'm going to do an entire show on that in the future.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.160]   Number nine,
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.040]   stay flexible.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.760]   And so by flexible,
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.400]   I mean,
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.520]   in this situation,
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.720]   things like don't have a lot of stuff and don't borrow money.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.160]   So I think two powerful ideas that can be really useful for net for,
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:12.360]   useful for financial planning are the ideas of minimalism and debtlessness.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:25.040]   And the reality is here is that minimalism basically a consciously choosing to live life with fewer or an appropriate amount of things rather than always trying to pile up as many things as possible.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.440]   That can be really freeing because if you don't have so much stuff that you need a five bedroom house,
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.520]   you have a lot of options.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.280]   Guys like Tynan,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:35.960]   who I mentioned earlier,
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.000]   if he can live in a backpack,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.880]   he can go anywhere in the world and that's what he does.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.760]   I think he still does it.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:47.000]   So if you have all your stuff that fits in a backpack or or in his case in a very small RV,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.880]   you can go wherever and now you have options.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.200]   And then the idea of debtlessness,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:53.760]   if you're not,
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.480]   if your income is not committed,
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.600]   if your future income is not already committed,
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.480]   which is what that is,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.360]   that debt is just simply a pledging of future income and future dollars to things that are already done.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.800]   Then you have choices.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.880]   And so if you lose your job,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.000]   consider these two things,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.480]   you're these two scenarios.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:23.640]   You have a large house with a large payment and a bunch of other large payments and a bunch of stuff and you lose your job and you can't find another one in the town that you're in or you lose your job.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.160]   You have a little bit of stuff,
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.040]   not too much,
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.680]   and you have no debt.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.120]   Well,
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:33.920]   that's because your rent or because that's because you rent or because you again,
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.200]   you know,
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.000]   don't own a home.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:35.560]   I mean,
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.200]   if you rent,
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:41.800]   what an awesome situation in no matter where you are in a 12 month lease and less than 12 months,
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.680]   you can be out of there.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.680]   Try selling a house three or four years ago when you're in this two year sales cycle world,
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.640]   this weird real estate world that we were in for so long.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.480]   You don't,
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.960]   you weren't selling a house in four months and going to another town to start a new job,
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.520]   but that's what flexibility can get.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.560]   Now with flexibility comes certain disadvantages.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.760]   So I own a home.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.120]   I'm not that flexible.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:04.760]   However,
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.360]   I gain other values.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.000]   I'm not that flexible.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.080]   I don't take other value from the home.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.080]   And that's a perfectly rational decision to give up on that.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.880]   But for the 18 year old me for that beginning phase of life,
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:13.560]   I would say,
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:20.280]   maintain flexibility and consider the value of ideas of the ideas of minimalism and debtlessness in,
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.240]   in your planning.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.200]   Number 10,
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.880]   invest in yourself and follow your hunches.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.360]   The best investments are always in yourself and in something that,
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:29.800]   you know,
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.040]   whether that means through formal education,
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.320]   whether that means through informal education,
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.240]   and I think it's really freeing to follow,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.680]   to follow your hunches.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.120]   In some ways,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.640]   I feel like this is a lesson that I've only just learned and am only just learning.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.720]   I've done a lot of different things,
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.800]   but this doing this podcast is kind of for me as a hunch.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.200]   I think that there is a desire.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.960]   I see this desire online.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.280]   I feel like there's this desire for financial knowledge that goes deeper,
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.040]   that goes a little bit deeper than just the surface fluff.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:05.960]   Not the mainstream.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.320]   I would never expect this show to appeal to the mainstream,
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.560]   but I see this hunger for information and I don't see it being served.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:18.040]   Now I've got a hunch that this whole podcast medium is going to be a major,
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.480]   major growth,
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.800]   a major,
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.640]   major area of growth over the coming five years.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:26.800]   Five years ago,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.400]   if you told someone I'm a blogger,
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.520]   that was not,
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.760]   no one knew what you were saying,
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.440]   but today everyone would know what that means and everybody reads blogs.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.040]   Well, podcasting,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.200]   podcasting is still non mainstream.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.800]   Very few people know what a podcast is.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.120]   Very few people listen to them.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.880]   Very few people know how to do that.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:42.920]   Five years from now,
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:50.360]   I believe it's going to be very different and you're going to have a world of people looking for looking for information,
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.040]   especially on the things they're interested in.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.560]   Some of those people are interested in finance.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:58.000]   So by creating the kind of show that I want to create that I would like to listen to,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:58.440]   excuse me,
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:00.640]   by creating the kind of show that I want to listen to,
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.680]   then it's fun for me to create and I got,
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.320]   I'm hoping,
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:04.960]   I believe that there's,
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.800]   at least a few hundred people out there that are probably pretty similar to me because we're all pretty much like each other.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:16.200]   And I think that over time my hope is that it could build into a business and I can serve you,
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:16.960]   the,
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.760]   uh,
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.400]   the listener.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.520]   I can serve you with clear,
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:27.560]   straightforward financial education that covers the technical and the actual that I got to come up with another name.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.440]   If you know a better name,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.120]   please let me know.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:34.880]   I don't know how to compare this dichotomy between what I call the technical and the behavioral or the technical and the,
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.320]   I'm struggling with the name,
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.880]   but the idea is that these kinds of things that I'm talking about today,
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.240]   these,
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:42.840]   in my opinion,
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   make far bigger of a difference than saying,
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.760]   open a Roth IRA on your 18th birthday.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.000]   And yet I think opening a Roth IRA is awesome,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.080]   but I want to start with what actually matters,
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:56.040]   which is things like don't be scared of people because so many people are scared.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.320]   And when you're scared,
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.360]   you take a junkie job that you don't want to have.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.840]   And then you ask your financial planner,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.680]   how can I get rich and how can I have lots of money when I can only afford a job?
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.160]   I can't afford to save a hundred dollars a month.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.240]   The answer is you can't.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.720]   Period.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.800]   Unless you do something more and different.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.960]   Now, can a hundred dollars a month over 40 years,
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.840]   a 10 percent make a million?
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.600]   Yes, probably.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.000]   I got to rerun the numbers, but but yes, it could.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:18.840]   But nobody does it.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.600]   Nobody has done that and nobody does it.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:27.080]   So you've got to do something else and you've got to figure out who you are and how to be OK with yourself.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.160]   So rant over.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:34.440]   But if you know of a word I'm trying to come up with a difference between the technical what what what guys like
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:40.280]   me, you know, people think guys like me do for a living and the behavioral,
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:47.040]   the emotional, the psychological, the the the inspirational,
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.760]   that type of thing, because they've got to go hand in hand again.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.240]   The reason people are fat,
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:57.400]   the reason I'm fat is not because of lack of technical knowledge or techniques that are unproven.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.160]   There's lots of technical knowledge and techniques that are unproven.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.080]   The reason is all of those psychological things, all those other hang ups.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.440]   I'm trying to figure out how to describe that.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.360]   So you can you can help me with that.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.400]   Back to invest in yourself and follow your hunches.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.560]   Consider, you know, what are you give things a go.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.400]   And so my point was that with the podcast, I've done a lot of interesting things,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:22.680]   but I'm following a hunch of taking a completely blind jump off a cliff and I'm
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   willing to go splat, so that's OK, but I'm just following a hunch.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.240]   But yet I love doing it.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.280]   It's so fun.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.960]   And I enjoy, you know, yesterday I prepping that big, long show and trying to dig through it.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.080]   I love it a lot, but I really enjoy it.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.160]   And I think it's just it's super fun.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.800]   So I'm following a hunch and it's so freeing to be out there on the edge.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.880]   That's where the fun is. Right.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.400]   Talk to any extreme sport athlete.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.560]   It's not playing it safe where you get that rush of adrenaline is out there on the edge.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.440]   Well, I'm not an extreme sports guy.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.280]   No interest in it.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.040]   But I can do exactly the same thing with business and with ideas like this.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.520]   So follow your hunch.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:01.200]   Consider investing in yourself through things like the personal MBA.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.920]   If you're not familiar with the personal MBA, Google it and
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.200]   I'll read a read 100 books on business and you'll gain a huge amount of knowledge.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.200]   You may still want to go back and get a traditional MBA with a certificate,
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.320]   but follow things like that.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.760]   If you look at the guy who wrote that, I think his name is Joshua
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.040]   Blanket on his last name.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.280]   But the author's name is Joshua something or other.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:28.280]   And he wrote the personal MBA and he was working a corporate job,
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.480]   started reading all these books.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.920]   And today he's got this incredible business, this online business where he does exactly
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.520]   what he wants to do every every day.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.680]   My favorite thing about his his his my favorite thing about his site.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:44.480]   If you want to be inspired, go look at his about page or go look at his his page
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:50.640]   where he says availability and and what you'll find is that he says,
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.240]   give me just a second, I'm going to pull this up.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.640]   It's Josh Kaufman.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.960]   And I've got it here.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.120]   Josh Kaufman dot net KAUFMAN.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:03.520]   And if you look here on his site, then what you will see is he's got a thing on here
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.000]   called status. And listen to this.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.920]   How's this for.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.920]   So this man, I've never talked to him.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.720]   I just read his book and I've read I really have enjoyed a bunch of his blog posts.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.000]   And so you've got a man named Josh Kaufman.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.880]   And he said so he started his story is that he started in the corporate world.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.560]   He was working for some big Fortune 500
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:24.000]   company, started reading a bunch of books on marketing and on business and all
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.520]   these things, and then also over time he started writing reviews of them and he
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:32.200]   compiled them into the personal MBA, which is his list of 100 books that he curates
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   this list.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.840]   These are the best 100 books for every area of business.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.440]   Really great. I haven't finished all of them, but I've read a lot of them.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.160]   And I really encourage you to consider doing the same thing.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.080]   So you go on his website.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.320]   He's a young man.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.800]   And it says Josh.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.200]   It's Josh Kaufman dot net slash status.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.360]   If you're interested, Josh Kaufman status,
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.360]   bestselling author, business and learning expert.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.800]   And at the top every day, I receive many requests concerning my
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.000]   availability for consulting interviews and new projects in the interest
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.920]   of saving time. Here's my current status and capacity summary.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.200]   Unavailable.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.920]   How awesome is that?
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.560]   I have very young kids at home.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.760]   As a result, I am unavailable for travel,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:22.520]   interviews, media, speaking, consulting, book reviews and new speculative projects.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.720]   I'm curtailing my interview availability,
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:28.320]   have no capacity to examine book galleys for reviews and blurbs.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:32.720]   And my guest post docket is full publishing on this site will continue sporadically
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.520]   as time and energy permit regarding partnership requests and speculative projects.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.720]   Unfortunately, I'm going to have to pass.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.720]   I'm forcing myself to turn down new
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.160]   opportunities so I can stay focused on my research and publishing projects.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.040]   I'm honored that many people want to do
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.640]   business with me, but my capacity is limited for the foreseeable future.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.920]   Thanks for thinking of me regarding speaking engagements.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.560]   In general, I avoid travel as much as possible.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   I have young children at home and my wife
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.240]   runs a business as well, so travel is very disruptive for all of us.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.200]   Thanks for thinking of me and I hope you have a great event.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.440]   Regarding feedback on business ideas,
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.600]   I do not provide personalized business advice at this time.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.640]   Understanding your business industry and personal objectives well enough to provide
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.120]   useful advice isn't a five minute endeavor.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.920]   I would like to say that about financial planning as well.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:24.320]   Continuing and I have more requests than it's possible to accommodate.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.680]   In the interest of preserving capacity for research and publishing,
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.160]   I'm not able to provide individual feedback on your business or idea.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.120]   Thanks for understanding.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.760]   Regarding blurbs, recommendations and endorsements.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.000]   I only mention or recommend resources I've personally used.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.360]   If you have a resource you think I'd find interesting, send me the link via Twitter
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.440]   and I'll check it out as capacity permits.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.040]   No need to follow up.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.920]   Regarding book review requests.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.400]   In general, I enjoy receiving new books to review, but I'm unable to guarantee your
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.200]   book will be reviewed. If you have a book you'd like me to look at,
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.760]   there's no need to contact me first.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.480]   Send it here to this address.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.800]   Books and resources provided will not be returned.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.080]   And become the property of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.960]   To maintain editorial
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.360]   integrity and prevent conflicts of interest.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:13.720]   All reviews are non paid and are provided only when a particular book is worth reviewing.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.960]   Is it just me or is that not awesome?
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.640]   You have so many people in the world that are saying, you know, look at me,
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.360]   look at me here, come hire me, come look at me, come see me.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:26.200]   You know, I'm certainly in that I'm certainly in that phase of life trying
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.040]   to say, come look at me, come check out what I'm doing.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:31.280]   I want to you know, if I can talk to you, if I can help, I can promote my stuff.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.440]   And here's someone who says, you know what?
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.240]   I've achieved the things I want to achieve.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.760]   And right now I'm staying at home and I'm
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.960]   taking care of my kids and I'm working on the projects that I think are important.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.880]   And, you know, what is more money?
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.520]   Do you what do you need to go if you have enough income coming in?
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.960]   Which he does. It's clear from his blog post.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.440]   Go and read them. I recommend them.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.280]   It's clear that he has enough income coming in to maintain his lifestyle.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.600]   What do you want? And still save someone.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.280]   What do you want more than that?
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.200]   What what on earth are you going to buy more than that?
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.560]   That you need more money than that.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.160]   So follow
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:04.480]   your hunches and and just kind of explore things and see where they lead.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.160]   And I commend his site to you.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.920]   And eleven, twelve and thirteen.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.080]   We're going to wrap up quickly here.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.640]   Number eleven, run your life like a business.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:16.120]   And in this sense, this can make two sense.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.840]   This can mean two ways.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.960]   Number one, it can be on the financial side.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.360]   And I think that that is a really valuable financial tip.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.320]   Run your life, your financial life like a business.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.840]   However, in this case, I mean more than that. Run your
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:32.920]   life like a business.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.880]   And get a sense of detachment.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:42.320]   So consider, OK, Joshua, if you were advising you, how would you advise yourself?
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.160]   And it sounds so dumb, but to me, that helps me a ton.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.960]   If you were sitting across the table and
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.800]   somebody was telling you this, this, this, this, this, what would you tell them to do?
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.680]   And somehow kind of get yourself in that idea of being the CEO of your life,
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:59.600]   of running your life like a business, thinking things through, doing projections,
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.480]   doing analysis,
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:06.440]   doing due diligence, carefully considering time, resources, money, energy, lifestyle,
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.720]   what the business is doing.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.520]   Consider the highest and best purpose.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.880]   Consider the speculative things that you do want to explore because there may be
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.440]   great opportunities and run your life like a business.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.840]   And you get a sense of detachment.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.600]   You get away from that being scared all the time.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.160]   Number twelve,
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.960]   recognize the fact and appreciate the fact every day or as often as possible that we
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.320]   live in an amazing world.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.920]   An amazing world.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.600]   Consider the lifestyle that we can live today.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.640]   This has never been possible in the history of the world.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.240]   Consider the fact that some of these people, these online personalities that I've
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.040]   mentioned to you, they can live anywhere in the world and run a business.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   And a hundred years ago, you had to be the the Sultan of Brunei.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.000]   I think that's still a country.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.440]   You had to be the Sultan of Brunei.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.720]   And even then, you know, you can go away for six months and you got to come back.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.080]   Otherwise, you're going to have a military coup that's going to overthrow you.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.240]   You couldn't do that kind of thing.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.720]   You had to be so vastly wealthy to go and travel and you had to
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.280]   maintain your business at home with letters or I guess telegrams.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.920]   2014, 1914 telegrams, phone calls at that point.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.720]   So just consider the world that we live in, that you can be anywhere in the world.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.560]   And I have no idea where Robbie is who sent me this tweet today,
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.440]   but he could be in West Palm Beach, Florida, next door to me.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.240]   Or he could be on the other side of the world.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.040]   I have no idea.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.560]   What an amazing world.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.960]   What an amazing opportunity.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.240]   What an amazing gift of the fact that if you're listening to me,
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.640]   it's very likely that you're living in a place where you probably can't fail.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:44.480]   Why would you not go for the things that you want to go for?
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.760]   So what? So so it doesn't work out.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.160]   What an amazing what an amazing opportunity that we have.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.840]   Consider the careers that you can can have.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.280]   Consider the fact that you can do work that's interesting.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.080]   You can do work that's enjoyable.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.240]   You can do work that you really
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.520]   can find a spark of of of creativity in and compare that to the drudgery that so
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.240]   many people in the world today still live under.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.280]   So many people in the world all through history have lived under.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.720]   Recognize that fact and start from that
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.360]   place of abundance of what an amazing world we live in.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.920]   The poorest, poorest person among us has a pretty good life.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.400]   Incidentally, Joshua's tip.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.080]   If you're a poor person in Chicago, come to Florida.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.560]   It's a lot better weather down here.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.640]   Number I don't understand why there's homeless people in Chicago.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.800]   I digress. Number 13.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.440]   Finally, read.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.000]   And if I have to say that anything else has served me well and that I would
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.200]   continue to encourage my 18 year old self to do is read, read, read, read, because the.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.080]   Your ability to see through mistakes and
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.280]   to avoid some of the big errors that can happen is going to be
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.880]   based upon.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.320]   I guess your exposure and your mentors and the reality is, however, that you can
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.240]   be mentored by.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.280]   Anybody that you want to be mentored by that you really respect and admire
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.440]   if they're if you really respect them and admire them and their close acquaintance
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   to you, just go and talk to them and they don't have it, they won't need to have
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.000]   written a book, but usually if it's somebody farther away
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.280]   from you that you respect and admire, they've probably written a book.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.080]   So you could go and be mentored.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   And I think that's a really good way to
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.280]   encourage people to read books and to be mentored.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.880]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.280]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.480]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.680]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.880]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.080]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.280]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.280]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.280]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.680]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.880]   And I think that's a really good way to encourage people to read books.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.080]   If you admire George Bush, go read his book.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.280]   If you admire Bill Clinton, you go back all the way back.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.480]   And go and read their books.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.680]   If you admire the great business leaders or the great humanitarian leaders or these great people,
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.880]   go read their books.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.080]   Read their blogs, especially today.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.280]   That's the other thing.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.480]   And you can choose anybody in the world to be mentored by.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.680]   What an amazing opportunity that we have.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.880]   And then go watch their TED talks.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.080]   Go on YouTube.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.280]   Just get exposed to great ideas.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.680]   And, I mean, that type of thing.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.680]   That type of knowledge.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.080]   That type of education.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.480]   In my mind, there's nothing better.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.080]   Like, that will pay off in spades.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.280]   I mean, the return on investment for the cost of a book.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.480]   I used to hear Jim Rohn used to say,
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.600]   just paraphrasing here, which I highly recommend.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.040]   What a great man he was.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.840]   But Jim Rohn used to say, "Rich people all have libraries in their house."
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.080]   Now, here's the question.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.080]   Did they have a library before they were rich?
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.640]   Or did they get rich first and then get
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.040]   a library?
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.200]   I'll let you figure that out for the day.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.320]   So with that, that's my show for today.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.520]   Kind of a little bit different and a little bit looser, a little bit more fun.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.920]   These are just some ideas that I've had.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.000]   And I'm sure if I were to make this list tomorrow, there would be 13 other things.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.040]   Same thing for you.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.360]   These are just things that I was thinking
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.800]   about today with regard to my life circumstance.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.720]   I hope they're helpful to you.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   I hope you enjoy enjoyed them.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.880]   I love the feedback.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.120]   Thank you for those of you interacting on Twitter.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:22.920]   Keep in common.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.200]   I'm going to keep asking questions.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.560]   And I think on Friday, probably I will put together I got some other good,
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.880]   great questions I put together a Q&A show going into a lot of other topics.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.040]   So if you would like to be a part of that, please shoot us a tweet at tweet me
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.800]   at RadicalPF and let me know what you're interested in my talking about.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.560]   Let me know what your question is, please.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.240]   If you haven't done so, come by the blog and sign up for the email newsletter.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.680]   Sign up for the email newsletter.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.640]   It's only going to be used to publish posts with information on the show notes.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.880]   So you can find out when the show notes are out.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.760]   When the show is published, when I hit publish and the show is published,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.120]   that email goes out within 10 or 15 minutes.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   So you'll know that the show is live and you'll know what the show notes are.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.480]   So, you know, the show topic.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.720]   Really appreciate that.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.280]   And thank you so much for those of you who were helping me with kind of the show
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.880]   promotion. I appreciate it.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.200]   It means the world to me that you would, you know, put a tweet out there.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.840]   Tell somebody about the show.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.240]   That means the world to me.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.760]   I just I thank you so much.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.040]   So with that, go live your dream.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.040]   And I'll see you next time. Bye bye.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:54.020]   Thank you.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.020]   Thank you.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.020]   Thank you.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.020]   Thank you.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:28.020]   Thank you.
