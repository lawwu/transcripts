[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   We had treadmill, federal government.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.200]   What's our third question of the day here, Jesse?
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.000]   - Next question is from Meredith,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.900]   and she says, "I'd love to reach a point in my career
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.800]   "where I no longer need social media
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.680]   "to raise awareness of my existence as a performer.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.540]   "Until then, how do I intentionally use social media
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.440]   "in the meantime?"
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.860]   - Right, so I think what's relevant here
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.240]   is the demographic information on Meredith
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.680]   is she's a 27-year-old Broadway touring artist,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.480]   which I take to mean she's in a touring company
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   of a Broadway show.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.540]   Meredith, I don't know the world of acting that well.
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.720]   I don't think for theater acting,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.180]   social media is all that important for you.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.520]   I don't think that's what's gonna make or break
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.240]   whether or not you get a role.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.860]   I am assuming that's gonna come down much more
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.680]   to the qualities of your performance,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.000]   the dancing, the singing, the stage presence,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.700]   how versatile, how reliable you are.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.940]   I think this is probably one of these industries
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.940]   where it's infected by the idea of social media
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.780]   because you are on stage,
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.080]   but that's probably more of a distraction than a help.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440]   I mean, I've definitely noticed that this year,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.440]   my wife and I subscribed to the Kennedy Center,
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.220]   so we had a subscription at the Kennedy Center,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.240]   so we went to see a lot of plays this year,
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.140]   and everyone in the playbill has their Instagram handles.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.220]   And I guess there's some sense of like,
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.220]   "Oh, you should be on here.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.600]   "I know there are some circumstances in movies
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.640]   "aimed at young people,
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.240]   "having a big social media presence
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.860]   "somehow helps if you're cast."
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.920]   I'm sure that's percolating down,
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.360]   but I can't imagine if you're a casting director
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.780]   for a touring company of a Broadway play
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.020]   that you're like, "Well, I mean,
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.540]   "how many followers does this people have on Instagram?"
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.340]   What you want is your play to work.
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.920]   So you really care about the actual attributes,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.640]   acting or acting skills the person actually has.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.760]   I mean, maybe I have that wrong,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.040]   but my sense would be, Meredith, don't sweat that.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.980]   Your sweat instead should be preserved for practicing
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.640]   and getting better at your craft.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.840]   (upbeat music)
