[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   What makes a great entrepreneur?
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.980]   Are they born?
[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.040]   Are they trained, right?
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.120]   What would you need to do to get 10 more Elans?
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.920]   What would you need to do to get a hundred more Elans?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.960]   What would you need to do to make a thousand more Elans?
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.960]   Are they already out there?
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.200]   And we just haven't found them yet.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.400]   Could we grow them some?
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.720]   Could we grow them in tanks?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.520]   By the way, do we need a different kind of training program?
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.360]   Do we need, I don't know.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.360]   Does there need to be a new kind of entrepreneurial university
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.520]   that trains entrepreneurs?
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.800]   It's just like a totally different thing.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.400]   Those are the underlying questions.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.080]   I think if you show me 10 more Elans, I'll figure out how to fund their companies.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.920]   I can tell you, like we work with a lot of great founders and we also work with
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.600]   Elan and he's still special, like he's still highly, he's still highly, he's
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.520]   still highly unusual, even, even relative to the other great entrepreneurs.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs)
