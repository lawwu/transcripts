[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Why is the Bible so violent?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It is very violent. So violent, it's gotten the attention of a listener
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   named Scott who writes us this, "Hello Pastor John, I walk my dog early
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   each morning while I listen to various audio books and to this podcast.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   This year I set for myself the goal of listening to the Bible from start
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   to finish. I'm on Judges at the moment and came across a passage that
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I had not read before, Judges 19. I
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   was shocked." Why are passages like this in the Bible,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   passages that are so violent, and what can they teach
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   us? I have young teens and I would never let them read or watch
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   media that describe this level of violence, and yet
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   here it is in God's holy Scripture.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Maybe I should make matters worse before I offer any answer.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   If you were shocked, Scott, by Judges
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   19, that is a concubine killed
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   by sexual molestation and then cut into 12 pieces
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and sent throughout the tribes to muster revenge, you probably
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   are a newcomer to the Bible, maybe a newcomer to the faith.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I am very glad that you are
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   reading or listening to the whole Bible. I would
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   encourage everybody who can read to read
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   all of the Bible over and over again because
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   the Apostle Paul wrote, "All Scripture
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   is breathed out by God and is profitable."
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   That's what he said. All of it is profitable
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and God-inspired. That includes the most violent parts
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and I would not withhold any of it from teenagers.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And I say that while totally agreeing with you
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   that most worldly presentations of violence
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   are not profitable and should be avoided.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But God's presentation of these things
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   in writing, in the inspired Scripture
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   is no mistake. He presents the world
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   in divine context-laden interpretive
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   words, not lurid videos of blood and gore that
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   preempt and replace the God-intended
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   movement from reading written words to having
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   word-built images in the mind. Verbal descriptions
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   with divine explanations are
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   not the same as worldly depictions for entertainment
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   or education with no ultimate divine meaning. We live
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   in a very soft, easily
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   offended, emotionally fragile culture
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   that unfits us to
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   grasp what most of history has been like and most of the world
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   is still like. I think God gave us the Bible
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   the way it is, with all the horrors,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   partly because he knew the day would come
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   when we would be so spoiled, so
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   cocooned, so overprotected, so
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   coddled, that we would not have the emotional
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and mental capacities to grasp utterly crucial
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   realities in the Bible and in the world. In other words,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I think that saturating ourselves in the whole
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Bible year after year shapes our minds
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and our emotions and our expectations
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   so that we have the mental and emotional
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   wherewithal to come to terms with central Biblical realities
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   which otherwise we would reject as simply outrageous.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   There are truths about God and about his
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   ways in this world and there are
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   truths about sin and judgment that
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   unless we have been made resilient in the face
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   of horrors, we will not be able to grasp. We won't be able
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   to grasp them with any sense of proportion and
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   truth. So all of that, Scott, just to say that I hope you
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   will press on in immersing yourself in the
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   whole Bible year after year. Those horrors are
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   there for a reason. So, let me
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   cut to the chase and give three answers to the question
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   why is there so much violence in the Bible? Let's start with the
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   context of the book of Judges. Four times in the book of
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Judges we read this sentence, "In those days there was no
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   king in Israel." And in two of those instances
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   that sentence is followed by, "Everyone did what was right
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   in his own eyes." One of those sentences stands
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   at the very gateway of the chapter Scott is asking about,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Judges 19, verse 1. As if to tell us
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   up front what this violence signifies. It signifies
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   what happens to a society
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   when the river of evil flowing from the human
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   heart runs wild without a damn of civil
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   authority to keep it from spilling out over the whole earth and corrupting with
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   violent effects. That's the point. There was no king.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Everybody did what was right in his own eyes. This is what happens when human beings run
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   rampant without any restraints. That's the most
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   immediate contextual explanation for the violence in the book of Judges.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   The book of Judges is written to demonstrate what
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   happens when human beings in all our sinful rebellion
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   against God have no restraints. This is a
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   very valuable lesson for us to learn from the Bible.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Lest we have some naive romantic
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   notions about the essential goodness of the human
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   heart, and lest we think it would be a
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   very good idea to dispense with civil authority.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   But that's not an answer to the most ultimate question
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   of why there is so much violence in the Bible.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   The reason there is such an abundance of violence
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   in the Bible is because there is so much violence in the world.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And so we must ask the ultimate question, why is that?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The Bible is documenting what is. It's not
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   creating what is. It's just telling us what is the reality.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And the biblical answer is that when sin entered the world,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   described in Genesis 3, that is when
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   God opposing, God rejecting, God disparaging,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   God demeaning, treason against God
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   entered the world, God responded not simply
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   by judging man's emotions and thinking and willing
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   and relationships, but also he responded
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   by subjecting the human body
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and the entire material and physical creation to his judgment.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And we see that in Genesis 3, and we hear it explicitly
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   in Romans 8 20. The creation was subjected
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   to futility. The creation was subjected to futility,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   to corruption, not willingly, but because of him who subjected
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   God in hope. Now, why did God do that?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Why did he ordain that the effect of moral
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   evil would be displayed in the horrors
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   of physical evil, earthquakes, floods, famines,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   pandemics, wars, and every manner of
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   horrible mistreatment of man on man? Oh my.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   He did it because he knew that
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   people who are dead in their trespasses and sins
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   would never comprehend the moral
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   outrage of treason against God unless they
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   saw it reflected in the physical outrage of
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   violence against man. Nobody loses sleep
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   over their treason against God, but let
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   their physical body be touched with cancer
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   or their house be touched with rioting, and then their emotions
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   really rise up with moral indignation.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Violence and suffering exist in this
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   world as a divine witness to
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   the meaning and the seriousness and the outrage
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   of sin against God. There's
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   one more answer to why there is
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   so much violence in the world and in the
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Bible. Revelation 13 8 says that
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   there was a book in God's presence before the
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   foundation of the world, and the name of the book is
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   the book of life
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   of the lamb who was slaughtered.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Revelation 13 8. All thoughtful Christians
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   know that at the center of our faith and at the foundation
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   of our salvation is one of the
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   grossest, most violent, and gory events
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   in the history of the world, namely the crucifixion of the
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Son of God. There is no salvation without
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   this violence. And what Revelation
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   13 8 shows is that this was God's plan
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And not only was it God's plan before the foundation of the world,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Revelation also tells us that we will
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   sing about this violence forever. Revelation
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   5 9. And they sang a new song saying
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   for you were slaughtered. That is the right word.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Sphagidamai. Slaughtered. Slain is a
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   lessening of the feel. You were slaughtered and
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   by your blood spilled shed gore.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You ransomed people for God from every tribe
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   and language and people and nation. Now, we might plan
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   a different kind of world and a different kind of
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   salvation from eternity to eternity if we were God.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   But that isn't our choice. God planned to
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   save us through violence. The gruesome
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   death of his infinitely precious Son.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And he said that this is how we know his
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   love. God shows us his love in that while we were yet sinners
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Christ died and we know how he died. Christ
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   died for us. There is no softening the death
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   of Christ as though it were a little gold symbol hung around our
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   pretty necks. So those are my
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   three answers. One, the violence of
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   judges exists to show what happens when the river of human evil
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   is not damned up by civic authority. Two, the
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   futility and corruption of creation exists to
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   give us some idea of the horror of sin against God.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And three, the most egregiously violent
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   act in history exists to save us
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and to show us the love of God. Amen. The most
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   spectacular sin of all. Thank you Pastor John and thank you for
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   the question Scott. That was Pastor John joining us today remotely

[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   about enjoying God and glorifying God. Are those
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   different things? Are they the same thing? Is enjoying
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   God kind of a private thing and glorifying God a public thing?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It's a really good question. Next on the docket for Pastor John, I am Tony Reinke
