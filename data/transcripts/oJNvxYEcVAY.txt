[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   You and Magnus played a private game,
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.200]   40 games of Blitz in 2010 in Moscow at a hotel.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.960]   This sounds and just feels legendary.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.080]   - The reason that I probably should not have agreed
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.960]   to play this match and why I very oftentimes reference it
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.040]   as one of the biggest mistakes
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.520]   in terms of competitive chess that I made
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.880]   is specifically because it gave Magnus a chance
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.960]   to understand my style of chess.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   - Are you and Magnus friends, enemies, frenemies,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440]   what's the status of the relationship?
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.000]   - Yeah, I think with all the rivalries in chess,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.440]   everybody tries to hype it up like everyone hates each other.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.200]   But the thing is at the end of the day,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.480]   yes, we're very competitive.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.440]   We wanna beat each other,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.880]   whether it's myself or Magnus or other top players.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.080]   But we also realize that it's a very small world.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.960]   Like a lot of us are able to make a living
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.440]   playing the game as professionals.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.520]   And as I alluded to earlier,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.680]   the top 20 to 30 players can make a living.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.480]   So even though we're competitive against each other,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.800]   we wanna beat each other.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080]   There is a certain level of respect that we have,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.720]   and there is a sort of brotherhood, I would say.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.200]   So all of us are, I would say, frenemies.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.400]   - The following is a conversation
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.200]   with Ikaro Nakamura, a chess super grandmaster.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.600]   He's one of the greatest chess players in the world,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.440]   including currently being ranked world number one
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.080]   in Blitz Chess.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.920]   He's also one of the most popular chess streamers
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.640]   on Twitch and YouTube, which you should definitely check out.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.600]   His channel's name on both is GM Ikaro.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.360]   This is the Lux Rhythm Podcast.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.600]   in the description.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.000]   And now, dear friends, here's Ikaro Nakamura.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.160]   You and Magnus played a private game,
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   40 games of Blitz in 2010 in Moscow at a hotel.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.280]   This sounds and just feels legendary.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.720]   Final score was 24 and a half to 15 and a half for Magnus.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.920]   Where'd you find out the score?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.760]   I'm actually curious.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.360]   I don't think it was publicly said
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760]   or it was very briefly said,
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.960]   but it wasn't ever mentioned in a serious way.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.280]   - I think it's a deep dive based on a few links
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400]   that started at a subreddit,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.080]   which is how all great journeys start.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.120]   - Yeah, so this is kind of a crazy story.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.600]   This was not pre-planned at all.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.720]   I remember this quite well.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.480]   I went out to dinner that final night
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.640]   with someone who was actually very hype
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280]   within the Internet Chess Club at that time.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.440]   I went out for a nice dinner.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.760]   I think I had a couple of drinks.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.600]   Maybe it was wine, beer.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.760]   I don't know what it was.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.320]   And I think towards the end of the dinner,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   somehow they got word of this
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.600]   and they relayed the information to me
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.880]   that Magnus wanted to play a private match.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.400]   Now I agreed to play this match.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.640]   Probably I should not have.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.960]   And actually it has nothing to do
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.600]   with like the state of having been out,
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.400]   had a few drinks, anything of that nature.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.560]   But the reason that I probably should not have agreed
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.440]   to play this match and why I very oftentimes reference it
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.520]   as one of the biggest mistakes
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.040]   in terms of competitive chess that I made
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.360]   is specifically because it gave Magnus a chance
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.240]   to understand my style of chess.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.600]   And at the time I actually had pretty good results
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.440]   against Magnus.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.520]   I think maybe he was up one or two games,
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.320]   but there were many games where I had been pressing
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.000]   close to winning against him prior to that match.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.600]   And so when I went and played that match,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   there were a few things that happened.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   First of all, Magnus really started to understand my style
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.120]   because we played all sorts of different openings.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.400]   And so I think he understood that at times
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.440]   I wasn't so great in the opening.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   And there were many openings
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.320]   where I would play slightly dubious variations
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.040]   as opposed to the main lines.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.520]   And then secondly, from my standpoint,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.040]   the problem that I realized
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.480]   is since we were playing with an increment,
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   there were many games where I was close to winning
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.960]   and he would defend end games amazingly well.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.480]   He would defend what are technically drawn end games,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.240]   but where I would have like an extra pawn,
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.280]   it would be like rook and bishop versus rook and knight.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.880]   Say I have four pawns, he has three pawns,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.160]   end games of this nature.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.400]   Now, if you aren't super into chess,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.520]   you might not understand what I'm referring to.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.560]   If you are, you will.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.720]   But there are end games where one side
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.440]   might have extra material and extra pawns,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.560]   say extra two pawns, but theoretically it's a draw.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.440]   - Can you give an example of the set of pieces?
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.200]   We're talking about five, six, seven pieces,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.040]   like this kind of thing?
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.480]   - Okay, like a very basic one would be rook and four pawns
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   against rook and three pawns.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.920]   So that would be nine total pieces on the board,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.960]   four pawns on one side, three pawns on the other side,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.520]   but it's all on the same side of the board.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.800]   Now this is a technical draw.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.400]   It's been known for probably, let's just say,
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.440]   70 years roughly, give or take,
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.680]   that this is a theoretical draw.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.360]   - No matter the position of the pawns?
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.400]   - It's just all the pawns are on one side of the board.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.240]   So like--
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.600]   - But like where they are?
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.720]   - So it's like, let's just say they're four pawns right here.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720]   They're just four pawns.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.080]   And black has three pawns.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.520]   So your pawns are on H6, G6, and F6.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.880]   And there are no other pawns on the board,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.080]   something like this.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.560]   And you both have rooks.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.400]   And it's a draw.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   No matter what the next 50 moves of the game are,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.280]   we know that it's a draw in end game with perfect play.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.520]   And so it was things like this
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.960]   where Magnus actually saved,
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.320]   I wanna say like five or six of these.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.640]   And I remember it quite well
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.880]   because I think the score was very, very close
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.640]   up until probably the last like 10 games of the match.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.760]   And then at the end, he started winning in spades.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.160]   But there were a lot of situations
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.280]   where he was up like one game
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.440]   or maybe two games in the match.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.080]   And I had some end game like this,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.280]   and I was not able to win the end game.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.600]   And so for me, after that match,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.640]   it wasn't even so much that I lost the match
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.160]   or the margin I lost by,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.560]   but it was the fact that I realized
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.080]   how hard it was to beat him
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.000]   even once you got the advantage.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.160]   And I think for Magnus,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.840]   he learned that my weakness was openings.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   I remember 'cause I actually,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.960]   I don't remember the game itself,
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.880]   but there was a game we played in Sicilian Nidorf.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.160]   And he played this variation with Bishop G5
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.440]   on move number six.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.320]   I'm sure you can insert a graphic later, I can show you.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   And I think-- - Sicilian is a type
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.560]   of opening.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.760]   - Sicilian is the opening, Nidorf is the variation.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.720]   It was played by Bobby Fischer, the former world champion,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.400]   Garry Kasparov as well.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.440]   And so we played all sorts of different openings
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.760]   'cause of course it's not a serious,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.160]   it's a serious match,
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.520]   but it's not serious where it's gonna count for the ranking.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.000]   So you're trying to fill out
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.720]   where your opponent is strong versus weak.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.000]   And so there was one game, I remember this very clearly,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.440]   he played the Bishop G5 variation in the Nidorf.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.960]   And I think I played E5 or I played Knight BD7 in E5,
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.800]   which is dubious, it's not the best response.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.000]   And that's just one example
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.120]   where I was playing things that were a little bit dubious
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.040]   and I was not playing the absolute main line
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.440]   with 20 moves of theory.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280]   So I was trying to get outside of theory.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.880]   And I think Magnus learned from that,
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.520]   that even though it appeared that I was very well prepared
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.240]   in these openings, I wasn't quite at that level.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.640]   - Couldn't you have a different interpretation
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.960]   of you going outside of the main line
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.120]   that you're willing to experiment, take risks,
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   that you're chaotic,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.320]   and that's actually a strength, not a weakness,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.240]   especially when you're sitting in a hotel room
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.520]   at late at night, this is past midnight, playing chess.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.960]   I mean, why do you interpret that that's your weakness?
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.200]   - Because Magnus going forward was able to figure out
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   the lines where you have to be super precise.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   You cannot deviate at all.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.880]   And I got punished out of the opening in many games.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   So it was like, it wasn't about the Nidorf,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.160]   the opening or the variation specifically,
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.720]   but he knew what my repertoire was.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.440]   And we would pick lines where I had to play
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.880]   the absolute best lines in order to equalize,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.120]   or I would be much worse.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.800]   And he was very effective at doing that.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.240]   - But nevertheless, it's pretty legendary
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.680]   that the two of you,
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.480]   you're one of the best chess players in the world
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   throughout the whole period still today,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.760]   that you just sat down in a hotel room
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.080]   and played a ton of chess.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.520]   Like, what was that like?
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   I mean, what's the, there's a,
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.920]   I think there's a little here,
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.440]   there is a little video of it.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.280]   - Sure.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.360]   - I mean, this is like epic, right?
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.920]   How did this video exist, by the way?
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.840]   - I think there was one journalist, Macaulay Peterson,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.800]   who was able to film parts of it.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.760]   So it was in a room, it was me and Magnus.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.200]   I think Henrik was there.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.040]   I think Macaulay was there and that was it.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.240]   People can go on YouTube and watch.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.880]   It's on Chess Digital Strategies,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.440]   Macaulay Peterson channel.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.720]   For people just listening to this,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.960]   there's a dimly lit room with a yellow light
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.200]   emerging out of the darkness of the two faces of (laughs)
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.320]   Sengaro.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.960]   I mean, and the deep focus here.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.800]   And what time is this?
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.620]   This is must be like--
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.960]   - This is probably like one in the morning.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.040]   This was, I believe the day after the,
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.720]   this was the day that the final round occurred
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.840]   and the closing ceremony.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.040]   So we're playing afterwards.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.680]   I mean, are you able to appreciate the epicness of this?
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   - Many of my favorite memories are actually similar to this.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   Another memory that I really have,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.800]   that I recall very fondly was after the US Championship.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.720]   It was called the 2005 US Chess Championship.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.080]   It was held at the end of 2004 in,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.660]   I believe it was in La Jolla in San Diego.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.520]   I won that event.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.720]   And after that event, I was playing Blitz
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.560]   probably for like four or five hours
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.140]   in the lobby of the hotel.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.880]   So it's the same kind of situation
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.860]   where you're just playing for the love of the game
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.440]   as opposed to anything else.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.880]   Of course, nowadays, I think both for Magnus and myself,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.300]   just playing a dimly lit room like this
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.800]   would almost certainly not happen.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.960]   There would probably have to be certain stakes involved
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.080]   for us to play.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.000]   But if you go back in time,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.700]   these are the sorts of memories and moments
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.380]   that would happen all the time.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.660]   - So is there a part of you that doesn't regret
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.840]   that this happened?
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.400]   - You know, I think it comes back to my general philosophy.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.320]   I feel like everything happens for a reason.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.940]   And so because I have that, that's one of my core beliefs.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.200]   Like I don't really look back on it as mistakes.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.640]   I feel like everything has happened
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.480]   and things have transpired the way they have for a reason.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.560]   If I look at it in terms of potentially
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.600]   like world championship aspirations,
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.980]   I think certainly it was a big mistake
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.560]   because from a competitive standpoint,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.960]   Magnus figured out what my weaknesses were at the time
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.240]   and he exploited it for many, many years.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.520]   In fact, I think if you look at the match
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.720]   I played against him in the Meltwater Tournament
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.080]   at the, I think that was in June or no, it was later.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.560]   It was like September of 2020, we played this epic match.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.400]   It was the finals of the tour
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.360]   and it went all the way to the seventh match.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.520]   Magnus won in Armageddon.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.840]   And in that match, my openings were much better.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.560]   I was able to match him in the openings.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.920]   I was not worse out of the opening in most of the games
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.460]   and that made a huge difference.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.040]   But for many years, he was able to exploit my openings.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.000]   And I mean, that's why the score,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.080]   I mean, it's not the only reason,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.200]   but it's one of the reasons the score
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.960]   is so lopsided the way it is.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.280]   - Is there any of those games that you mentioned,
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.280]   the seven games that are interesting to look at,
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.760]   to analyze, ideas that you remember
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.160]   that are interesting to you?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.560]   - I mean, the whole, it was actually,
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.200]   so to set it up, and this probably will come into play
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.480]   in terms of World Championship format,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.840]   it was seven matches of four games.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.600]   So we played a four game match.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.720]   And after four games, say I'm up two and a half,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.680]   one and a half, I win match number one.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.920]   Then it's, so it's like you have to win
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.640]   four matches of four games.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.040]   - Do you remember how you won?
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.320]   - There were a couple of Berlin games in the sixth match,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.660]   I believe in the seventh match as well,
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.720]   where Magnus actually made some mistakes
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.240]   and I won some critical games.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.920]   - You're gonna have to explain some basics here.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.240]   So Berlin's the type of opening, what's that?
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.920]   - The Ruy Lopez or the Spanish opening.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.360]   It actually existed all the way back in the '60s,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.040]   but it really became popular in 2001, I believe it was,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.320]   when Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.640]   played their World Championship match.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.320]   Kasparov had been the world champion for a very long time.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.360]   I think it was close, I think it was about 15,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   15 years roughly, maybe a little bit more than that.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.840]   And he lost the match because when Garry had the white pieces
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.080]   Kasparov was not able to effectively get an advantage.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.880]   A lot of those games were very quick draws,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.280]   and in chess you want to put pressure on your opponent
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.200]   when you have the white pieces.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.000]   So Kasparov was not able to do anything
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.660]   with the white pieces, and Kramnik was able to beat him
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.000]   when the colors were reversed.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.640]   Kramnik won a game in the Grunfeld,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.480]   he won a game in one of the Queens Gambit
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.160]   declined slash Nimzo variations as well.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.480]   And that was the reason Garry Kasparov
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.600]   lost the World Championship title,
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.520]   was because of this variation.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.080]   - Can you teach me the Berlin opening?
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.520]   - Absolutely, so the opening starts,
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.960]   let me just move this microphone up a little bit,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.600]   starts with E4, and then it goes E5,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.120]   Knight F3, Knight C6.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:52.120]   Yeah, Bishop B5, and now Knight to F6.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.480]   - And at which point is this the standard,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   like this is the Berlin standard?
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.560]   - Yeah, this is the Berlin, this is the starting position
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.160]   of the Berlin defense, and white has many, many options here.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.640]   Now it's interesting because I did work with Garry
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.600]   at a certain point, and I remember I had access
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.640]   to his database, and he had something like 220 files
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.200]   on the Berlin defense.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.520]   Because what happened is, is Garry's somebody who,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.800]   the way that he learned chess, it's very much like,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.440]   there are certain openings that are okay,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.560]   there are other openings that are not okay.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.920]   And so this was considered dubious at the time.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.680]   And so Garry basically decided to go into this endgame
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.520]   with castles, Knight takes pawn.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.560]   - Why is the castling an endgame?
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.120]   - So I'll show you, Knight takes pawn.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.600]   All these moves are very, very forced.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.440]   You got pawn to D4.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.880]   - What does it mean they're very forced?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.600]   That means like those are the optimal things
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.440]   that you should be doing?
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.560]   - Exactly, these moves are, I think they're almost,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.280]   at least for black, they're absolutely forced,
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.200]   or else you end up in trouble.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.440]   - You said Knight takes D4?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.360]   - Knight to D6.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.200]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.760]   - So this attacks the bishop on B5.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.600]   - Got it.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.320]   - White takes, black takes back with the pawn
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   in front of the queen.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.320]   Mm-hmm, pawn takes pawn, Knight to F5.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.720]   And then it goes queen takes queen.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.560]   - What?
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.400]   - King takes queen.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.240]   - It's very aggressive.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.400]   - Yeah, so you get this position
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.040]   where we're in an endgame by the 10.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.640]   - You just ruined all the normal conventions, I guess.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.480]   - Right, on the other hand, for Kramnik,
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.400]   it was quite brilliant because Garry,
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.600]   what he was known for was opening preparation
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.480]   and getting the advantage.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.640]   He was a very tactical, very aggressive player.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.920]   And you're playing an endgame right from the start.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.400]   Now Garry basically thought that this was better for white,
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.720]   and he tried to prove it.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.440]   And he was unable to prove it, I think,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.040]   up until maybe it was game nine or game 11.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.160]   Actually, maybe I had the order wrong,
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.680]   'cause I think he was white in the even number games.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.240]   Basically, he spent four or five games
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.800]   with the white pieces trying to win this endgame.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.880]   And he was not able to win.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.360]   In fact, he didn't even come close to proving an advantage.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.240]   So he kept wasting the white pieces in that match.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.920]   And Kramnik basically took advantage.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   When he had the white pieces and Garry had the black pieces,
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.720]   he was able to win some games in very nice style.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.840]   And that was the difference.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.040]   - D'oh, that's kind of brilliant.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.920]   So he had, this is a new problem presented in that match.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.160]   And Garry's gut says--
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.000]   - White is better.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.040]   - White is better.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.800]   And so in white, I'm going to push with this position.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.280]   And I'm gonna not change anything from match to match.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.920]   I'm going to try to find a way that this is better.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.120]   So it's that kind of stubbornness.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.560]   And what do you think about that?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.600]   Like, that's the way of chess, right?
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.440]   That's not a mistake.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.720]   That's the way you should do it.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.080]   If your gut says this position is better,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.560]   you should capitalize, right?
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.920]   - I think that's an old school way of thinking in chess
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.760]   because before computers, basically it was up to humans.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.080]   Your intuition, your calculation process really determined
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.880]   whether a position is better.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.800]   And so like, in Garry's time, if openings were dubious,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.640]   they're dubious.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.840]   It means somebody is better.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.760]   But as we've learned with computers now,
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.600]   even small advantages, generally that doesn't mean anything.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.920]   And a position is defendable where you won't lose the game
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.520]   if you play optimal moves.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.200]   Even if the advantage is like half a pawn, for example,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.080]   like 0.50, with optimal play,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.480]   a computer will still prove that that position,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.000]   you can hold it and not lose the game.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.120]   And so for Garry, he learned it where like,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.040]   if an opening's not right, like he knows it's not correct.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.280]   He has to prove it.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.720]   Now, finally, towards the end of the match,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.320]   he tried to switch, but it was already way too late.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.720]   And he didn't have time to win with the white pieces.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.880]   He did come close in one of the later games,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.360]   but he spent the whole match trying to prove
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.440]   that this Berlin defense is not playable.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.880]   - So this position, the computer would say
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.080]   that black is better.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.920]   - It would say that white's very slightly better
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.320]   because black has moved the king.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.600]   You're unable to castle the king,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.800]   and it's kind of open in the center of the board.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.960]   - Oh, so wait, so Stockfish or the engine
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.560]   would agree with Garry's intuition?
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.360]   - Yes, but at the end of the day,
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.720]   when you go like five moves deeper
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.080]   in any number of the sequences,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.280]   it's gonna go to 0.00.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.440]   - Which means draw.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.320]   - Yes, correct.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.040]   - And that's a bad thing because white should be winning.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.640]   - Well, you wanna put pressure on your opponent
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.080]   when you have the white pieces in any tournament, any match.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.680]   - Got it, so if the engine says 0.00,
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.040]   that means you're not doing a good job of playing white.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.880]   - Correct.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.720]   You should be putting pressure.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.560]   That doesn't mean you're gonna win.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.880]   There are gonna be a lot of draws
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.000]   'cause the game of chess has drawish tendencies,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.360]   but you wanna try.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.440]   Normally, the general approach these days
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.680]   because of computers is you try to put pressure
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.280]   on your opponent when you're white,
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.780]   and when you're black, you try to be solid, make a draw.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.120]   That's the general approach.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.600]   Now, when Garry was actually at his peak,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.480]   it was quite the opposite.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.160]   Garry was trying to win games with the black pieces as well
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.400]   by playing openings like the Sicilian Night Orth,
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.120]   but with modern technology,
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.240]   and I did a podcast recently where I also spoke about this,
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.920]   computers are so good,
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.800]   and players can memorize so many lines
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.600]   that nowadays trying to take risks with the black pieces,
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.400]   it almost always backfires,
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.280]   or if you're very lucky, you might make the draw,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.760]   but you never get the winning chances.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.700]   So from a risk-reward standpoint,
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.400]   you have to play almost perfectly just to make the draw,
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.280]   but you're never gonna have any winning chances,
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.980]   where in the old days, generally, you might lose the games,
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.560]   but you're gonna have chances to win as well,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.080]   but now it's very much one-sided.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.160]   So a lot of players try to be very solid.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.280]   - This is, by the way, the C Squared podcast?
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.120]   - Correct, yes.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   - Yeah, this is an amazing podcast,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.320]   so shout out to those guys.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.040]   I'm glad that they started a thing
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.800]   that seems to be a good thing,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.800]   and I hope they keep going with this good thing.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.520]   That was a great interview that I did with you.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.840]   - In that podcast, I talked about the Sicilian Night Orth,
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.640]   very aggressive opening.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.780]   The problem is white is the one who has the choices.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.760]   After the first five to six moves, white has the choices.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.200]   What do you wanna do?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.280]   Can you show me that?
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.160]   - Sure, so it's, for example, that would be E4.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.600]   I'll just set it up, E4.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.280]   C5.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:47.260]   Now we get Knight to F3, Pawn to D6.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.900]   Pawn to D4, trade.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.280]   Knight to F6.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.360]   - Knight to F6.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.560]   - And now Pawn to A6.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.600]   So this is a Knight Orth.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.040]   Bobby Fischer really popularized it
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.480]   in his run-up to becoming the world champion.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.640]   Gary played it for probably the last 15 to 20 years
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.760]   of his career, so it's a very solid opening defense.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.680]   - What is, what are then, sorry to interrupt,
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.960]   what's interesting about this?
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.200]   So there's a, for people listening,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.720]   on the white side, there's a couple of Knights out,
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.560]   and on the black side--
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.480]   - So black has many options.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.160]   Black can play for B5 here to develop the Bishop to B7.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.880]   Because the Pawn on A6 guards the Pawn on B5.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.040]   You can also play other setups, like potentially G6,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.820]   and putting the Bishop on G7.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.360]   - Okay, so bringing, doing different things
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.200]   and bringing out the--
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.920]   - You can also push the Pawn to E5,
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.160]   or push the Pawn to E6.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.760]   So there are many different setups,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.720]   and it's very, very flexible.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.080]   But white is the one who has the choice here
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.440]   in terms of what to play.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.280]   And there are many moves.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.840]   There is this move that I mentioned before,
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.680]   Bishop to G5, which Magnus played against me.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   There's also Bishop to E3, Bishop to C4.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.140]   And now there are also moves like H3, H4, Rook G1.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.600]   Even moves like A3 and A4.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.200]   So there basically are nine or 10 moves
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.600]   that white can play here.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.400]   But the move that white plays sort of dictates
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.020]   the direction of the game.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.320]   And you have to be extremely precise if you're black.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.000]   So if white plays something like Bishop G5,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.920]   this is very sharp and aggressive.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.960]   But you can also play something like Bishop to E3,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.880]   Pawn to E5, and something like Knight to F3 here.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.600]   And it goes in a positional direction.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.040]   So again, this is very advanced.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.640]   These are very advanced sort of setups.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.280]   And what I'm explaining is not at a basic level.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.920]   But white is the one who chooses the type of game.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.400]   Is it very aggressive, very sharp,
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.800]   or both sides of chances?
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.160]   Is it something very positional,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.440]   where if you're black, you're probably okay,
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.880]   but you have to play the best moves in order to equalize,
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.280]   or you can end up worse.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.560]   - Okay, so you're always responding
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.760]   as black in this situation.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.600]   - Correct.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.160]   - So how different are all those different variations?
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.040]   So like with the Bishop, with the different,
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.400]   you said you bring out the Bishop to this position,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.520]   to this position, or to that position.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.920]   Like how are those fundamentally different variations?
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.440]   Like I just wonder from a AI computational perspective,
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.920]   like a single step.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.560]   - Yeah, well, I'll make it even simpler here.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.640]   If you put the Knight here, it's very positional.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.160]   If you put the Knight on this square, it's very aggressive.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.800]   Because normally white is going to push this Pawn
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.120]   from F2 to either F3 or F4,
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.200]   and potentially a Pawn to G4 later.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.960]   So even here, based on where you go,
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.280]   it changes whether it's a positional game,
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.440]   or it's a very tactical.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.360]   - Just those little, and those are the choices
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.400]   you're constantly making.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.520]   Am I going to be standard, and basic, and positional,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.240]   or am I going to be aggressive and take risks?
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.280]   - And I can actually give you another example.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.760]   So psychology plays a big role.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.000]   And in the candidates tournament,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.440]   which I played in June of this past year in Madrid, Spain,
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.200]   I actually, I had the white piece against Ali Reza Faruja,
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.240]   who is a rising junior, originally from Iran,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.720]   representing France.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.320]   And I knew that he wanted very aggressive games.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.080]   So he doesn't normally play this Sicilian Eidorff,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.680]   and he chose to play it in this one tournament.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.240]   So I knew that he wanted these very sharp positions
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.280]   where he can lose, but he can also win.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.240]   And so when I played him,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.360]   I intentionally played this variation
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.040]   because I knew that he was going to be unhappy.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.080]   He wanted these sharp, exciting games.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.880]   And here I am playing something very boring,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.320]   where if he plays it correctly, it's going to be a draw,
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.560]   but he's not going to be happy.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.800]   And so he actually did something dubious
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.680]   because he wanted to create tension.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.080]   He wanted to create chaos.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.680]   - So you knew by being boring, you would frustrate him,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.920]   and then he would make mistakes.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.640]   - Exactly, yes, yes.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.600]   - That's the ultimate troll at the highest level of chess.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.840]   Yeah, you mentioned psychology,
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.920]   and then taking us back to the Magnus,
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.000]   even in 2010, the Magnus games.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.560]   Reddit said that you've spoken about losing to Magnus
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.800]   being a hit on your confidence.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.240]   Is there some truth to that?
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.720]   So is there some aspect about that 2010 match
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.680]   that's not just about Magnus figuring stuff out,
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.200]   but just a hit on confidence?
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.160]   Like how important is confidence at that level
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.680]   when you're both young and like firing at all cylinders?
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.320]   - Well, it's not just a problem with me.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.120]   This is the problem everybody has when they play
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.200]   against Magnus, because what happens is,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.600]   is on a broader level, when you play against somebody,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.720]   no matter who you're playing against,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.960]   but when they're somehow able to save positions
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.120]   where they're much worse, almost in miraculous ways,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.880]   the way that Magnus has done against everybody.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.680]   He's done it against me, done it against Aronian many times,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.880]   done it against Kramnik, just about everybody.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.560]   When someone's able to save games,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.280]   it really starts to affect you
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.400]   because you don't know what to do.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.760]   And the more and more times that happens,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.680]   it starts adding up, and it just affects you
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.000]   in a way that it's very, very hard to overcome.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.040]   And I think every top player has that issue,
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   where if they've played against Magnus
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.760]   more than like five times,
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.080]   they've seen things happen in the game
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.600]   that don't happen against anybody else.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.640]   And then psychologically,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.360]   it becomes harder and harder to overcome it,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.600]   which is why I think a lot of the junior players,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   they don't have this long history, and it does affect them.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.440]   As far as myself directly,
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.520]   certainly after that match, though,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.440]   it was not the same playing against Magnus,
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.520]   because I viewed him completely differently too.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.480]   After all those games where he was saving these end games,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.040]   I started thinking like, this guy is superhuman.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.600]   But you can't really have those thoughts
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.160]   when you're playing competitively.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.440]   But in the back of your mind, it's always there.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.000]   And I think every top player has that issue.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.080]   - Is there a way to overcome that?
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.240]   'Cause you have to.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.160]   - I don't know if I'll necessarily do better
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.680]   against Magnus going forward,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.360]   but I felt that when I started playing against him
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.120]   more than just a game here or there in classical chess,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.400]   during the pandemic, I played him
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.080]   in these online tournaments, seemed like every month.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.000]   I came very close.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.040]   I beat him in one event.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.880]   I think I lost in two others, and then the tour final.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.040]   But when I was playing against him more and more,
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.280]   he didn't feel superhuman.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.760]   It felt like as I'm playing more and more
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.760]   and learning about his style, that I was doing better.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.440]   So I think for me, the weird thing is
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.440]   that I just wasn't playing against him that many games.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.800]   But when I start playing against him like 20, 30 games
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.000]   during the course of a year,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.480]   I actually started feeling more confident
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.120]   'cause I feel like I can compete.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.400]   Whereas when I was only playing him like three
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.480]   or four times in classical chess
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.760]   in the previous couple of years, I wasn't doing great.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.080]   And then you don't have those glimpses of,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.720]   you don't have those moments where you feel like
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.440]   you're gonna be able to win against him.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.000]   But when you start playing 20, 30 games
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.480]   and you get these opportunities,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.320]   even if you don't convert,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.560]   you feel like you have the chances.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.560]   When you play three or four games and you might lose one,
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.520]   draw three, you never have those opportunities.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.080]   And so you feel very negative about what's going on.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.560]   - When you were able to beat him
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.280]   or not necessarily win the game,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.080]   but win positionally something, what was the reason?
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.880]   Like technically speaking,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.680]   the matchup between the two of you,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.760]   what like, where were the holes that you were able to find?
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.760]   - I mean, the answer I think is actually quite simple.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.640]   I think it's all psychological, actually,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.000]   more than anything else.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.280]   Because I didn't feel like I was doing anything differently,
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.240]   but I was also not making the mistakes
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.200]   that I was making before.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.080]   So I think it was more psychological than anything else.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.360]   - On your part versus his part.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.200]   - It's very weird because when you think about chess,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.620]   it's a mental game.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:09.000]   But we all are capable of beating Magnus, all of us.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.840]   But we all have very, very bad scores against him.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.720]   And I think people underestimate
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.840]   how much of a role that plays.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   And for me, when I played him in these online events
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.720]   in 2020 specifically,
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   I felt like there was really nothing to lose,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.760]   which also ties into everything else that happened
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.440]   during the pandemic as well.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.680]   But I just felt like there was nothing to lose.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.200]   And I felt like I was playing very freely,
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.640]   unlike before.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.760]   Now that's not to say that Magnus isn't a better player,
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.600]   that like somehow I expect to beat him,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.040]   but I felt like I wasn't making the same mistakes
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.240]   that I was making in the previous years.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.080]   - If we dig into the psychological preparation,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.840]   is there something to your mental preparation
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.800]   that you do that makes you successful?
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.520]   Like what are the lessons over all these years
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.600]   that you learned?
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.160]   What works, what doesn't?
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   Do you drink a bunch of whiskey the night before?
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.000]   Is there some small hacks or major ones
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.600]   about how you approach the game?
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.720]   - It's really hard sort of in a way
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.120]   because I feel like I'm two different people.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.720]   I was one person up until the pandemic
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   as a professional chess player solely,
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.200]   where I earned all my income.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.040]   Everything was derived from that.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.680]   And from the pandemic on, I'm sort of a different person
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.800]   'cause that is not where I'm making my income from.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.080]   And so the whole psychological profile that I had before
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.000]   is completely different from now.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.960]   There's this joke about the, I literally don't care,
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.000]   the phrase that I've used.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.640]   And in a sense, what that means is not that I don't care.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.240]   Obviously I'm competitive, I want to do well.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.160]   But if I lose a game or I don't do well in a tournament,
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.600]   it's not the end of the world in the same kind of way
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.960]   that I felt it was before,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.360]   because that pressure of needing to always perform
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.600]   was very, very high.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.560]   And so I think before the pandemic,
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.680]   what I would try to do more than anything
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.560]   is just not think about the previous game for the most part.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   Like say I had a bad game,
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.360]   I'd go out for a walk that evening, just clear my mind.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.880]   These sorts of things, now they aren't really hacks per se,
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.840]   but it's trying essentially to have short-term memory loss.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   (laughs)
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.720]   So I literally don't care is not just a meme,
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.440]   it's a philosophy.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.840]   - In a sense, yeah. - It's a way of being.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.920]   - I mean, it's basically that, yes,
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.600]   like I do want to perform well, I'm gonna give it my all,
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.720]   but it's not, like if I lose a game,
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.600]   it's not the end of the world.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.720]   - That should be the title of your autobiography.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   And it should be like, I know you're probably immortal,
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.200]   but if you do happen to die,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.120]   that should also be in your tombstone.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.760]   Charles Bukowski has "Don't Try" in his tombstone.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.440]   - Yes.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.040]   - Which I think emphasizes a similar concept,
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.680]   but slightly different, more in the artistic domain,
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.600]   which is, well, a lot of people have
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.080]   different interpretations of that statement,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   but I think it means don't take things too seriously.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.960]   - Yeah, I mean, I agree with that completely.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   I think that if you look at my career prior to the pandemic,
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.600]   I put huge amounts of pressure on myself
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.040]   because I really wanted to be as good as I could be,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.960]   but it was the way I was earning a living.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.400]   And one thing that's very difficult about chess
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.160]   is that only the top 20, maybe 30 players in the world
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.400]   make a living from the game.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.480]   Now you make a very good living,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.880]   no way am I diminishing chess,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.760]   but the problem with it is it's not secure at all.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.520]   So if you don't get invitations
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.040]   to the absolute top tournaments,
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.200]   which have prize funds from anywhere from maybe 100,000
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.280]   up to potentially half a million dollars,
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.680]   if you don't get those invitations,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.440]   it's very, very hard to earn a living.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.280]   You can go from earning maybe 200,000,
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.040]   $300,000 a year to earning like 50,000.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.960]   So it's very, very unstable.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.240]   And I think for myself,
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.320]   I really put a lot of pressure on myself
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.600]   in a way that it affected me and not in a good way.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.540]   - So in part, it was also financial pressure.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.000]   So like once you're able to make money elsewhere,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.320]   it makes you more free to take risks
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.360]   to play the pure game of chess.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.800]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.100]   It took all that pressure off
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.560]   and I'm just trying to play as well as I can.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.500]   And I don't really worry.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.840]   Like if I lose a game, it's not the end all be all.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.560]   And maybe that's just like psychological stuff
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.600]   that I should have tried to sort out before.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.480]   I mean, I did at some period of time,
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.240]   like do certain things along those lines,
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.200]   but I became free.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:23.320]   And I think it definitely, it was not about the chess.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.880]   And that's one of those things that's also very hard
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.740]   because when I look at myself
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.820]   and when I had these periods
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.960]   where it seemed like I played better or improved,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.680]   one of these periods was in 2008,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.100]   where I basically, I dropped out of college.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.720]   I was about 2650 Elo.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.600]   So I was roughly top 100 in the world.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.880]   And for the first, probably half part of 2008,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.000]   I played very little, almost not all.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I went up to Vancouver.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.840]   I was living on my own for the first time
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.100]   and I was not studying that much.
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.540]   And then after that period, I started playing
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.400]   and I actually improved very quickly
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.160]   and I broke 2700 shortly thereafter.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.720]   So it had nothing to do with chess.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   - When you moved to Vancouver and weren't doing much,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.360]   what were you doing exactly?
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.600]   - Oh, I was enjoying nature.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.280]   I was going outside, hiking mountains,
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.560]   like going and kayaking,
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.320]   all these things that I was not,
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.280]   that I had not done for many years.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.440]   - I'm glad I asked 'cause I was imagining something else.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.200]   I was imagining you like in a dark room,
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.520]   drinking and playing video games.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.600]   - No, not at all.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.520]   - Okay, cool.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.520]   That's good.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.840]   That's an interesting break.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.360]   So dropping out of college and then giving,
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.920]   taking a break and then giving everything to chess
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.620]   in terms of preparation and so on.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:37.720]   Maybe actually, if we can rewind back to the beginning,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.780]   you've said about yourself
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.120]   that you're not a naturally talented chess player.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.040]   Your brother was, but that's really fascinating
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.760]   because what would you say was the reason you're able
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.500]   to break through and become one of the best chess players
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.600]   in the world, having been not a naturally talented chess player?
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.520]   - Yeah, I think that this applies to actually chess
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.800]   or any number of sort of basic games actually
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.520]   for that matter is that I'm not naturally talented,
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.760]   but if I don't get something,
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.840]   I try to figure out why don't I get it?
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.840]   What am I doing wrong?
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.320]   Over and over and over again.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.520]   And I mean, there are many games like this.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.880]   There's this funny game on the phone.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.160]   I'll just use it as an example.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.380]   There's a game called Geometry Dash.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.360]   Now I'm not like, I'm not world-class or anything at it.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.060]   It's just a silly, silly little game on the phone
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.860]   that you play, you just tap and it goes up and down.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.220]   People will probably know what that is.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.660]   But like I said, I played that for maybe like an hour or so.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.620]   I just randomly placed for one hour and I was terrible at it.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.980]   And I kind of forgot about it for a week.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.300]   And then I came back, I saw on my phone, I'm like, okay,
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.140]   what am I doing wrong?
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.900]   Like, why am I not good at this game?
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.540]   So I spent like probably like a hundred hours
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.960]   over the following month, just playing it nonstop
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.340]   over and over and over again to get better at it.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.520]   And again, I'm not like world-class or anything,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.000]   but I'm pretty good at the game.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.400]   And so with chess, it's the same thing.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.640]   It's like, when I started out, it's like,
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.520]   why am I not good?
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.840]   What am I doing wrong?
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.680]   And I basically refused to accept
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.280]   that I couldn't be good at the game.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.160]   And so, you know, at the start, I actually,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.040]   I played for a couple of months.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.480]   I did very poorly.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.840]   And then my parents stopped me
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.640]   from playing for about six months.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.000]   They just said, no, you're not playing.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.760]   Your brother's quite good.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.440]   And my brother was one of the top ranked players
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.400]   in his age group in the United States.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.780]   So you're not playing.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.020]   Then after about six months,
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.580]   they relented and they let me play.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.460]   And the first term of back, I actually, it was four games.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.820]   I was playing against other kids
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.060]   and I won the first three games.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.900]   So it was really good.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.120]   And I lost the form of checkmate in the fourth game,
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.860]   which is of course quite ironic.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.700]   - How did you?
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.520]   (laughs)
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.360]   - Yeah.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.860]   - Oh, I guess this is, how old were you at this time?
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.540]   - I would have been about eight years old, seven or eight.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.540]   - So an eight year old future top ranked chess player has,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.240]   so it's great to know that somebody has lost
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.400]   to that checkmate.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.640]   So it's possible to lose to that checkmate.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.960]   - I remember that game quite well.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.040]   - Was it, I mean, at that time,
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.080]   did you know that that checkmate exists?
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.280]   - I mean, I think I probably knew it existed,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.840]   but I didn't, I was just playing.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.020]   Like it's a completely different world than now.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.360]   If a kid goes on their computer,
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.560]   they can immediately figure out
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.280]   what are the basic checkmates, all these different things.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.160]   At the time that didn't really exist.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.720]   You'd have to find it in a book.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.560]   - Yeah.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.640]   So this is just a basic blunder.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.320]   - Cool.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.800]   - Yeah, so it's like I came back, it was a very good start,
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.040]   and then I lose like this, but I stuck with it.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.960]   I improved very, very quickly thereafter.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.800]   And yeah, it was very straightforward.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.720]   - What was the secret to that fast improvement?
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.000]   So you said like this very first important step,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.960]   which is saying like, what am I doing wrong?
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.800]   Like I have to figure out what I'm doing wrong,
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.160]   but then you actually have to take the step
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.840]   for figuring out what you're doing wrong.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.120]   - Yeah, I think it was just,
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.640]   I just, I played as much as I could.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.520]   Like it wasn't like I was consciously thinking about it.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.960]   As an eight year old, you're not really thinking
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.160]   about those sorts of things with a big picture.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.720]   So I just basically kept playing as much as I could,
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.840]   whether it was online, whether it was against my brother,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.960]   reading these chess books as much as I could.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.880]   I just devoured as much information as I could.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.520]   - So you were studying chess books?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.360]   You were studying chess books?
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.760]   - I was, I mean, I wasn't studying them
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.840]   cover to cover though.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.440]   It's like you just study certain diagrams,
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.280]   certain positions.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.840]   - So openings and stuff like that, you were?
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.160]   - Mostly tactics, actually.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.200]   Openings were not, other than top level chess,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.680]   openings were not a thing probably.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.200]   I want to say for players below maybe master level
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   in a serious way until maybe like the early 2000s.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.080]   - So for people who don't know chess,
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.720]   what kind of tactical ideas are interesting
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.200]   and basic to understand that once you understand,
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.120]   you take early leaps in improvement?
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   - Yeah, so it's things like forks, for example,
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.600]   where you attack two pieces at the same time,
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.560]   discovered attacks like checkmates,
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.440]   and again, winning like a queen or other material.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.960]   Those are probably two most important ones.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.080]   Batteries, or batteries and pens, things of that nature.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   - How many, how rich is the world of,
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.560]   and by the way, discovered attacks are when you move a piece.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.600]   - And you put a king in check to win like a rook,
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.440]   for example, or other material.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.800]   - And forking pieces is when you're attacking two pieces,
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.320]   so obviously the other person can't move
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.200]   two pieces at a time,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.720]   and they're gonna have to lose one of them.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.800]   Okay, so how big is the world,
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.680]   the universe of forks and discovered attacks?
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.040]   You know, I myself know,
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   so there's like knights attacking like, what is it?
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.800]   - There are forks, knight attacking like a queen
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.840]   and a rook, for example,
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.360]   or like a pawn attacking a queen and a rook,
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.720]   or like a rook and a bishop.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   It's innumerable.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.000]   There, I mean, but I will say that I think that with chess,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   the more of these patterns you see,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.560]   the quicker you catch them.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.200]   And that's how you improve, I think, the most
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.120]   is by learning these basic tactical themes
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.760]   at the beginner levels.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.160]   - Are you, when you're discovering those patterns,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.840]   are you looking at the chessboard
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.480]   or are you looking at some like higher dimensional
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.640]   representation of the relative position of the pieces?
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.120]   So basically something that's disjoint
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.400]   of the particular absolute position of the piece,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.080]   but like you're seeing patterns like this kind of pattern,
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.800]   but elsewhere on the board.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.000]   Like, are you thinking in patterns
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.360]   or in like absolute positions of the pieces?
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.200]   - Both.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.360]   I think that at the higher levels,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.680]   you're always thinking about like,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.280]   you're thinking about the patterns
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.760]   on one side of the board specifically,
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.520]   but then also what happens is you play more and more.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.440]   If you're a very strong player,
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.520]   you will be able to remember say pawn structures
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.320]   where the pawns are on certain squares
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.040]   from games that you've played like 15, 20 years ago,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.360]   even potentially.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.200]   So it's a mix.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.080]   I think a lot of it is more subconscious
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.600]   than actively thinking about it
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.440]   and like figuring it out like that.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.160]   The only thing for me that I definitely
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.520]   am doing very frequently when I play
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.720]   is trying to look at my pieces.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.480]   Are they placed on the optimal squares?
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.720]   Are there better squares?
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.680]   And then once I get past that, like using the basic logic,
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.480]   I start to think about, okay, pure calculations,
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.640]   like what are the moves that make a lot of sense
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.040]   and start calculating direct moves.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.320]   But one of the most basic things that I think that I do
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.000]   that a lot of people actually should do that they don't do
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.440]   is looking at the piece placement
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.920]   and trying to figure out what pieces look like
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.360]   they're on good squares versus bad squares.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.480]   - So am I, for each piece asking the question,
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.320]   am I in my happy place?
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.680]   Am I in my like optimally happy place?
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.760]   - Yeah, I think that's very important.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.320]   Like if we look at this position on the board right now,
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.280]   this is a good example.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.720]   - Who's not in their happy place on the board right now?
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.760]   - I think both sides are actually pretty happy right now.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.640]   But the thing is, if you're playing with a black piece,
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.160]   what is a move that sticks out to you
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.760]   to like follow basic principles?
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.000]   - Basic principles probably bring out the bishop.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   - And then castle the king.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.840]   - Castle the king.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   - Right, exactly, that's correct.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.240]   And that's what you should do.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.560]   That's the best way to play the position.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.040]   Now, once you do that though--
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.280]   - By the way, I have a vibrating device inside me right now.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.520]   So I knew that.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.440]   - Right.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.800]   - So my rating is 3,400,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.120]   which is what I believe Stockfish is.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.960]   - No, it's higher.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.000]   It's like 3,800 actually.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.840]   - Is it 3,800?
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.660]   - I think it is.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.360]   - I'm using an earlier version of Stockfish.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.280]   Okay.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.480]   Anyway, sorry, you were saying?
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   - So like that's very basic.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.640]   But then if you move the bishop out and you castle the king,
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.240]   well, let's just say bishop B7, play this, you castle.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.400]   Okay, so now you've done everything
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.060]   with the pieces on the king side.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.080]   So what would be the next set of,
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.920]   what's the next way to try and develop the pieces?
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.200]   - So everything here is pretty strong,
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.560]   except maybe this pawn?
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.400]   I don't know.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.220]   - Okay, but think about the pieces.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.240]   So by pieces, I mean everything except the pawns.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.520]   - Except the pawns, okay.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.240]   Probably either bishop or knight on the other side.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.840]   - Yeah, and that is correct.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.840]   You wanna bring out the bishop and the knight.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.680]   So let's say you go bishop to E6.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.840]   - Bishop to E6, yeah.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.240]   - Yeah, I'll castle.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.520]   Now you can move the knight to either square.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.240]   It's somewhat irrelevant, but just move the knight.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.880]   I'll just play knight to C6.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.400]   - What was your random move?
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.240]   Bringing the bishop up?
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.060]   - I just moved my rook to the center.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:56.900]   - Okay, got it.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.720]   Oh, well, what's your unhappy place right now?
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.560]   - Okay, so let me move the queen
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.160]   to just follow some basic principles.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.400]   - Okay, 'cause I wanna bring my rooks
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.480]   to the center of the board.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.400]   - Yes.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.000]   - So in this position, you've pretty much
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.920]   developed all your pieces.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.280]   There are only two pieces that you haven't
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.800]   brought into the game.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.720]   - The queen and the rook.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.500]   And this, you consider to be in the game because it was--
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.960]   - I wouldn't say it's in the game,
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.560]   but there isn't really a great square
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   for that rook right now.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.720]   But in this position, you would probably move your rook to C8,
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.920]   and then the middle game begins after that.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.040]   - Got it, so here.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.160]   - Because now you've gotten your piece
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.560]   to all the optimal squares,
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.120]   and now you have to look for a specific plan,
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.200]   but you have gotten these pieces developed
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.280]   out of the opening.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.240]   And that's a very basic thing
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.880]   that I think a lot of people don't think about,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.600]   is what are the optimal placements for the pieces?
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.580]   - So you're constantly thinking about the pieces
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.480]   that are not in their optimal placement
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.400]   as you're doing all the other kind of tactics
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.240]   and stuff like that.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.440]   - But that's a basic thing that people can follow.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.880]   Actually doing pure calculations,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.080]   like moving five or 10 moves in your head,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.840]   that's not realistic.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.960]   But trying to use basic logic
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.680]   to figure out what pieces are on squares that look correct
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.920]   is something anybody can do.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.200]   - What about looking at the other person's pieces
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.560]   and thinking about the optimal placement of them?
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.360]   Like if you see a bunch of pieces
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.900]   not in their optimal placement for the opponent,
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.160]   what does that tell you?
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.560]   - I mean, that's a higher level concept, of course.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.280]   Like I'm trying to give a beginner example.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.640]   That is something that I do think about as well.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.260]   Like I try to think about my opponent's pieces.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.660]   Like that is basic logic.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.760]   I think a lot of people these days
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.880]   at the upper levels of chess,
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.880]   they look at the game as something of pure calculation
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.400]   and you lose that human element.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400]   You're trying to just calculate
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.160]   all these different sequences of moves
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.880]   and you don't think about the basics.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.720]   And it's something, it'll be interesting to see
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.700]   what happens with the next generation of kids
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.280]   who become very strong
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.120]   because that is really how they approach the game.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.180]   They learn with computers.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.240]   Whereas like I learned with computers at a certain point,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.000]   but I did not start off with computers from the get-go.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.400]   So human element still exists in my game.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.600]   Actually, Magnus, I think has said this too,
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.920]   where he did not use a computer,
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.880]   I think until he was maybe like 11 years old,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.320]   something around there.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.380]   And so we have that human element to our game
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.480]   that I think the newer generation won't have.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.540]   Now, it doesn't mean they aren't gonna be better than us,
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.480]   but it's gonna be a completely different approach.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.000]   - What do you mean by human elements?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.080]   Just basic logic versus raw calculation.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.040]   - So it's like anybody now will use a computer
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.440]   from the time they start the game.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.920]   And you use a computer,
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.480]   you look at the evaluations after the game
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.800]   to see how you're doing.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.400]   But you don't really ever have those moments
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.280]   where you're just, it's you,
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.440]   or it's just you and your opponent.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.960]   One thing that was great in the old days
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.780]   before computers simply became too strong
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.480]   is that you would actually do analysis
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.120]   with your opponent after the game.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.840]   And that's very much this two humans analyzing a game.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.320]   It's you and your opponent, two peers,
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.440]   and you come up with these human ideas.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.460]   It's not automatically run back to your room,
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.520]   look with a computer and, oh, I should have played this move
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.280]   and it's just like winning the game.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.320]   So that is kind of something that no longer exists
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.280]   in the game of chess because, as I said,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.400]   there's no reason to analyze with your opponent after the game.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.160]   - Are there ideas that the engine tells you
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.680]   that you can't reverse engineer with logic
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   why that makes sense?
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.040]   And you start to just memorize it, that's good.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.960]   - Yes, so in the opening, for sure,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.040]   there's certain positions where moves are playable.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.920]   And I can even give you an example,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.760]   actually in this night,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.120]   we can just set the position up a few moves earlier.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.620]   Yeah, knight over on B8, bishop on C8,
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.160]   and just move the king back to the center,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.840]   bishop back to F8, and pawn to E7.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.600]   So the pawn in front of the king
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.680]   just push it back two squares.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.980]   So like, here's an example.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.520]   There's a move here that nowadays humans will play,
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.480]   which is this move, pawn to H4.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.500]   And this is a move that 20 years ago,
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.480]   if someone showed this move to Kasparov,
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.240]   he would just laugh at them, no matter who you were.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.360]   He would basically say, "You're an idiot.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.520]   "What is this move?
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.060]   "You're pushing a pawn on the edge of the board.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.400]   "It does nothing."
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   And this is something that's playable,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.040]   but even if you were to ask me or any other top grandmaster
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.200]   why it's playable or why it's a move that makes sense,
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.320]   we wouldn't be able to say why it makes sense.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.160]   'Cause it doesn't, we just know that it's fine
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.440]   because the computer says it's fine.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.960]   - It's fine or is it good?
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.080]   It's just fine?
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.600]   - It probably, like everything else,
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.800]   is equal with perfect play,
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.480]   but it definitely, if you're not careful,
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.580]   black, you can be worse, for sure.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.160]   But if you ask me, I can't say why it's a good move.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.680]   I can say, "Okay, maybe I'm gonna expand on the king side.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.440]   "I'll push this pawn here and push the pawn forward.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.720]   "Maybe I can put the bishop on G5,
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.800]   "and in some situations, the pawn guard's the bishop,"
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.940]   but I can't give an actual good explanation
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.360]   for why it's a move that makes sense,
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.520]   'cause it doesn't make sense.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.720]   - It's fascinating that young people today,
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.120]   kids these days, would probably do that move
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.160]   much more nonchalantly.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.280]   You'll see that a lot more
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.960]   because they know it's safe, at least.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.640]   - Right, because they know the computer says it's fine.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.440]   But I grew up without computers,
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.520]   and so to me, it's you're pushing a pawn on the edge,
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.800]   it's the opening phase, you don't do things like this.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.520]   It's just, it looks ridiculous.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.920]   Now, of course, I have worked with computers long enough
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.200]   that I know, like I'm not,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:11.120]   I know that computers prove that everything is fine,
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.320]   but still, to me, it does feel wrong.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   - Yeah.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.280]   Well, I think as computers get better,
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.800]   they'll also get better at explaining,
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.240]   which they currently don't do,
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.380]   at basically being able to do,
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.320]   so first of all, simple language generation.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.400]   So a set of chess moves to language conversion,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.480]   explaining to us dumb humans
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.240]   of why this is an interesting tactical idea.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.160]   They currently don't do that.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.920]   You're supposed to figure that out yourself.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.320]   Like why, what's the deep wisdom
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.800]   in this particular pawn coming out in this kind of way?
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.720]   So let me ask you a ridiculous question.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.400]   Do you think chess will ever get solved
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.840]   from the opening position
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.280]   to where we'll know the optimal, optimal level of play?
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.520]   - I highly doubt it.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.280]   Without major advances in quantum computing,
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.640]   I don't think it's realistic
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.960]   to expect chess to be hard-solved.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.300]   I just, I don't think that will happen,
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.680]   but I don't know.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.480]   It could happen 20, 30 years maybe,
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.080]   but I think in the near future, it's not realistic.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.360]   - Well, then let's go up with a pod head follow-up question.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.520]   Suppose it does get solved.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.000]   What opening do you think will be the optimal?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.160]   - Well, everything will be a draw for sure after move one.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.720]   - For sure. - After move one, yes.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.560]   - For sure. - Absolutely.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.520]   - You're absolutely sure of that?
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.640]   - Yes, yes.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.960]   - That's, why are you so sure?
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.920]   - I'm so sure because when you look at the computer games
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.560]   and you see these decisive results,
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.760]   it's because they play, the openings are set generally.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.280]   They can't, for move one, they play set openings.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.120]   So you might play the knight
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.800]   or you might play the Berlin defense.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.360]   Normally it's set openings as opposed to,
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.320]   as opposed to computers being able to do whatever they want.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.560]   I just believe in general,
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.840]   in the openings that are symmetrical,
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.360]   like E4, E5, D4, D5, the computers will draw.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.000]   And I think the optimal opening,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.760]   I think E4, E5, knight F3, knight F6
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.040]   is probably a guaranteed draw.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.580]   If there is perfect, if we have perfect information
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.840]   and we know that chess is solved,
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.440]   E4, E5, knight F3, knight F6,
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.480]   the Russian or the Petrov defense,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.360]   that will be the optimal strategy.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.000]   - See, so that's symmetrical play
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.600]   is going to lead to a draw.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   But what if you can constantly as white maintain asymmetry,
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.800]   constantly keep the opponent off balance?
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.880]   So yes, E4, then you're always doing this symmetry.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.720]   But what if chess inherently,
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.120]   there's something about the mathematics of the game
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:45.120]   that allows for like that thin line that you walk,
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.920]   that maintains to the end game, the asymmetry constantly,
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.080]   that there's no move that can
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.160]   bring back the balance of the game.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.800]   You don't think that exists?
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.640]   - I don't think it does.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.400]   So basically I'm saying E4, E5, I think is a draw.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.200]   I think D4, D5 is a draw.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.080]   C4, C5, I think basically it's symmetry.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.560]   That's- - All of it's a draw.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.200]   - I think that's why it's a draw.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   - So it doesn't even matter.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.640]   Like you're saying if it's solved,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.520]   most openings will be a draw.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.640]   - Yes, I think E4, D4, C4, Knight F3 for sure will be a draw.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.360]   Other openings, I'm not sure about,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.600]   but those first four possible starting moves,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.400]   I think chess is a draw.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.920]   - Knight F3, what's the response to Knight F3?
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.840]   - Probably Knight F6 again.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.840]   Or to make it simple,
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.840]   if I play Knight F3 on move one,
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.640]   black here can also play D5 on move one.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.000]   And normally at some point,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.400]   white's gonna end up playing D4.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.760]   - So the order of- (laughs)
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.280]   - So it's probably gonna lead back,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.560]   yeah, all roads kind of lead back there as well.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.000]   There probably are other ways which,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.360]   where there is play,
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.880]   but I think that's at the end of the day,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   the symmetry is what's gonna lead to like a forced equality
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.560]   or draw in the game of chess.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.960]   - So Demis Hassabis is the CEO of DeepMind.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.000]   DeepMind helped create or created AlphaZero.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.880]   He says that he's also a chess player
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.160]   and he's a fan of chess.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.680]   And he says the reason,
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:20.460]   his hypothesis is that the reason chess is interesting
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.320]   as a game is the creative, quote unquote,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.280]   tension between the bishop and the knight.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.360]   So like there's so many different dynamics
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.400]   that are created by those two pieces.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.600]   You think there's truth to that?
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.920]   I mean, some of that is just poetry,
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.520]   but is there truth to that?
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.640]   - I think it's definitely true
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.580]   when you look at the imbalances
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.720]   that are not like crazy attacking positions.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.480]   Like one thing that Bobby Fischer
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.840]   was really, really good at when he was the world champion
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.080]   is playing end games with a bishop versus a knight.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.520]   Now, traditionally we think of the knight
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.200]   being better than the bishop, even today in end games,
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.220]   but Fischer proved that there are a lot of end games
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.560]   where a bishop is better than a knight.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.240]   So I do agree with that statement.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.520]   It's like the imbalances between like bishops and knights
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.800]   in many positions, you never really know.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.760]   Like there are many positions
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.960]   where a knight is better than a bishop
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.720]   or knight and bishop are better than two bishops
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.440]   or like it is all the imbalance.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.920]   Generally it is the imbalances though
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.200]   between the bishops and the knights
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.820]   or combinations of the two pieces
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.440]   that lead to the most interesting positions.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.440]   So I agree with that.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.280]   - Interesting positions.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.220]   What about fun?
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.720]   Is there like aspects that you find fun
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.840]   within the game itself?
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.560]   Not all the stuff around it,
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   but just the purity of the game?
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.360]   - I think for me these days,
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.360]   when I see some of these moves that computer suggests
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.520]   after a game that I play and I just go, wow,
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.760]   that is the beauty for me
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.360]   because these are not moves that I would ever consider.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.760]   And when I then see the move
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.040]   and then like I might make a couple of moves
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.640]   to try and understand why, that is the beauty to me
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.420]   is seeing all these things that just like 10 years ago,
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.960]   I never would have even seen
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.800]   'cause computers weren't at the level they're at today.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.880]   And so the depth and creativity of what they're saying,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.640]   even if it's not like in our language,
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.760]   but in the evaluation, that's where I find a lot of beauty.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.680]   - Oh, that's fun.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.200]   So like the computer is a source,
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.120]   it's a source of creative fulfillment for you.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:07.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.360]   I mean, I think also it's very humbling as well.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.920]   It's like, when you spend your whole life playing a game
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.680]   and you get pretty good, you think you're pretty good at it.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.960]   But even like, even for Magnus,
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.640]   I think when we look at it and you see like these things
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.440]   that we've spent 20, 30 years playing this game
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.600]   and it just, it doesn't click and then you see it,
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.080]   it's just like, it really is beautiful.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.680]   - You're known for being a very aggressive player.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.040]   What's your approach to being willing to take big risks
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.580]   at the chessboard?
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.160]   - Well, I think that's another thing.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.560]   I was a very aggressive player
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.000]   probably until I got to about this 2700 Elo
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.080]   and then it kind of, my style changed a little bit.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.800]   I think what it is is I like to play attacking chess.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.640]   I loved playing openings like the King's Indian,
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:54.160]   the Sicilian Eidorff as well when I was a little bit younger
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.300]   and it's just like, why not try to fight
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.200]   with both colors, try to fight in every game
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.000]   and win if you can, try as hard as you can.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.820]   Now, one of the things is as you get better and better,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.720]   players are also better and better prepared.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.420]   So you have diminishing returns
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.080]   when you play these very aggressive openings
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.720]   like the King's Indian or even the Dutch,
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.120]   which I played for a while.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.600]   You can only, it only takes you so far
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.520]   and then at a point people figure out what,
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.180]   how to respond to those choices.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.440]   So I still do play these openings.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.480]   For example, I played a tournament in St. Louis
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.540]   about three weeks ago and I played a great King's Indian
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.540]   game, which I won against Jeffrey Zhang,
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.620]   an American junior player.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.540]   So I still do play it here and there.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.620]   But when you start playing it every game,
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.620]   there's a point at which when you lose these games,
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.460]   you just can't, it becomes too much.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.020]   And I spoke about this in the C Squared podcast
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.300]   where I played the Eidorff
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.380]   and then I played Fabiano Caruana,
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.220]   a very strong American player as well.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.380]   And he just blew me off the board in like four straight games
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.020]   and I'm like, okay, enough, enough of this.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.900]   I just can't, I can't keep doing it.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:54.100]   - Because do you think he prepared for that opening then?
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:54.940]   - Absolutely.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.520]   - Because you see what have,
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.380]   what has my opponent been playing recently?
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.400]   Where's their ideas?
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.020]   And so I'm going to prepare for those ideas
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:02.860]   that they've been playing with.
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.580]   - Exactly, yeah, that's what you do.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.780]   And also you have to be very self-critical
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.460]   'cause for Fabiano, the Eidorff was the one opening
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.100]   he did very poorly against, but he worked really hard
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.820]   and he came up with a lot of different ideas
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:16.020]   and he solved that weakness.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.620]   - What's the role of, you're also known
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.780]   of having a bit of an ego.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.500]   What's the role of ego in chess?
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.700]   Is it helpful or does it get in the way?
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.660]   - I think it's a mix.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.260]   I think there's a fine line.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.180]   I think you have to be very confident
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.340]   in order to get to the top.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.540]   I know some players are very expressive like myself,
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.980]   like Kasparov and others.
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.060]   There are other people like Anand who don't express it,
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.400]   but then there was a book that I think was released
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.340]   fairly recently where he basically said
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.140]   like he was really angry in his room
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.080]   and he was like banging walls or doing something with chairs.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.740]   I don't remember the exact story,
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.740]   but like he was able to, in public,
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.620]   he kept it very like very buttoned up,
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.180]   but then in private he wasn't.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.500]   I think you have to have that edge.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.640]   If you don't have that edge and you don't get upset
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.820]   when you lose games, because you will lose games
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.660]   along the way, then it's impossible
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.780]   to get anywhere near the top.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.420]   So I think every top player has that ego
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.100]   or extreme confidence that is necessary.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.660]   If you don't have that, you'll never, I think,
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.820]   get to the top, probably in almost any field, frankly.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.060]   - Do you have to believe you're the best
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:18.060]   to have the capacity to be the best in the world?
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.060]   - Yeah, I think you have to have that.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.820]   I think for me, it wasn't really ever about
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.780]   thinking I'm the best in the world.
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.620]   It's about like going into that game.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.900]   That game, whoever I'm playing,
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.220]   I believe that I can beat them,
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.540]   or I know that I'm gonna beat them,
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.900]   or I'm better than them.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.060]   For me, it was always about that,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.580]   whenever I'm in that moment in the game,
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.300]   just knowing that I can do that.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.500]   I think that is also another thing
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.300]   that when you start playing more and more
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.060]   in these top tournaments, you kind of lose that sometimes
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.420]   because the positions, you have the same opening strategies.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.620]   You end up with positions that are very drawish
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.740]   where you reach end games, things of this nature.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.380]   And so it can also make you very jaded as well
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.660]   after you've been up there for quite a long time.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:57.500]   - Were there times you were an asshole to someone
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.420]   and you regret it at the chessboard or beyond?
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.300]   - Yeah, so I think-- - Asking internet questions.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.900]   - Yeah, I mean, this is definitely true.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.060]   I'm not gonna pretend it isn't.
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:09.180]   When I was younger, I was very angry
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.060]   when I would lose games on the internet.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.420]   Many of these stories are specifically
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.500]   from the internet, of course.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.620]   And I think I look back on it,
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.860]   and of course I wish that I'd been able
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.420]   to channel the anger differently.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.460]   Basically, I think the simple gist of it is
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.780]   I would play Blitz games online and when I lost,
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.100]   I would get angry at my opponents
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.300]   instead of getting angry at myself.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.540]   Which of course, it's silly 'cause they're playing the game,
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.380]   they're trying to win.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.060]   Why shouldn't they try to beat you?
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.300]   I think for me, I'm not happy about that
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.900]   when I was a young teenager getting so angry
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.300]   over these online games and insulting a lot of people
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.460]   along the way.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.140]   - But maybe that paved the way to your streaming career.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.420]   - I think for me, I feel like having
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.060]   that me against the world attitude, though,
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.580]   it really fueled me when I was younger.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.980]   Feeling like it was me against the world,
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.500]   everyone hating me or me hating the world.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.340]   That was very important.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.580]   I was able to channel that anger
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.860]   in a way that really helped me improve.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.900]   So do I regret it?
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:01.860]   On the one hand, yes.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.420]   Of course, I think you don't wanna be like that.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.660]   On the other hand, what I've gotten as good as I am,
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.780]   if it was different, I'm not so sure.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.020]   So, mix.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.620]   - Well, then I'll ask you to empathize
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:15.660]   with somebody else who currently has
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.820]   a me against the world attitude and is helping him,
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.380]   which is Hans Niemann.
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.260]   For several reasons, he has me against the world
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.100]   kind of attitude.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.420]   Well, let me ask, there's been a chess controversy
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.220]   about cheating and so on that you've covered.
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.900]   People should subscribe to your channel.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:35.100]   You're hilarious, entertaining, brilliant,
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.940]   and it's just fun to learn from you.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.660]   Do you think, as we stand now,
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.580]   Hans ever cheated in over-the-board chess?
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.420]   As things stand now at the beginning of October.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.180]   - Yeah, that's a very tough question
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.660]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.020]   I think, first of all, when people refer to evidence
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.880]   in regards to whether Hans cheated over-the-board,
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.020]   there is not, and I don't think there ever will be,
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:01.180]   quote-unquote, hard evidence.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.340]   The only thing that would ever constitute that
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.500]   is if he's caught in the act.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.180]   Literally, he's caught using a phone with an earpiece,
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.100]   whatever it might be.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:10.940]   That is the only way that there would ever be hard evidence.
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.740]   So, as it stands right now,
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.480]   there's a lot of circumstantial evidence.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.300]   How much of it is legitimate or not remains to be seen.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.900]   I know people have questioned the statistics.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.660]   Some people think it's very convincing.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:24.220]   Some people think it's complete nonsense.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.220]   I think that right now, I'm very undecided,
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.780]   but I do feel that within the next three to six months,
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.100]   assuming Hans is able to play over-the-board
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.940]   in more tournaments, the stats will make it very clear
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.660]   one way or the other based on our results,
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.140]   whether it's legitimate or not.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.820]   I think for me, I would say that regardless
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.740]   of whether I believe he cheated or not,
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.620]   he is playing at probably at least 2,650, no matter what.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.180]   Regardless of whether he's cheating or not,
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.900]   he's already at that level, which is very, very high.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.980]   So, I think the stats will bear it out in the next,
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.940]   probably, I said three to six months,
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.380]   probably I would say next six to 12 months,
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:05.780]   whether something happened, but I really don't know.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.180]   - Do you find compelling or interesting
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:11.220]   the kind of analysis where you compare
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.220]   the correlation between engines and humans
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.620]   to try to determine if cheating was done in part?
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.940]   - So, initially, I thought that
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.820]   that was actually quite legitimate,
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.060]   but as I found out much more recently,
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.100]   anybody can basically upload this data.
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.940]   So, that whole theory, while it seemed
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:28.460]   very convincing at the time,
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:33.460]   it simply isn't any statistical evidence, in my opinion, now.
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:37.060]   But there are games from some of those tournaments
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.020]   that definitely, considering where his rating was,
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:43.060]   look very suspicious in 2020, I would say.
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.060]   Again, that's not the role of myself to decide,
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:48.700]   or Chess.com, that's obviously gonna be up to FIDE,
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.180]   whether they think that's compelling evidence or not.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.340]   I think, for me, what I would say
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.580]   from an intuitive standpoint is that
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:59.820]   I've been in this world for a very, very long time.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:02.700]   I've seen most of the juniors as they've risen
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:04.980]   through the ranks, Magnus and many others,
[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.260]   and there's always been something about them
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.300]   that has stood out to me,
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:10.140]   that's been a brilliant game they've played
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.780]   against someone who's much higher rated.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.260]   I've just seen it from all of those players.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.100]   I never really saw that with Hans Niemann.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.740]   So, it's very difficult for me to,
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.140]   with my own two eyes, being in this chess world so long,
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.820]   see things a certain way,
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.020]   and then something that's never happened before is happening.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.940]   But at the end of the day, it is still possible.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.860]   It is completely possible that Hans,
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.260]   something clicked at a certain age,
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.740]   and he started improving, in spite of the fact that
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.340]   the statistics look weird,
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.780]   in terms of his rating improvement.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.020]   So, I don't know.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.620]   I think that in six to 12 months,
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:44.580]   I'll probably be able to say one way or the other,
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.100]   with very certain confidence,
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.660]   like whether he should be there or not.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.420]   - Speaking of statistics, I should ask,
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:53.940]   I'm not sure about this, are you a data scientist?
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.900]   - Right, that's a good one.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.460]   No, of course I'm not.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.060]   But that's the thing.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.980]   You see all these stats are thrown out there,
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.540]   and you try to understand what's being said.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.020]   But it's also very scary,
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.500]   because when you see these things that look very legitimate,
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.180]   and then they're disproven,
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.740]   or people say you're cherry picking the dates,
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:13.580]   and all these other things,
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.500]   it almost feels like you can come to any conclusion
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.780]   that you want to.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.980]   And that's why I think this is such a serious issue
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:19.900]   for the world of chess,
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:24.140]   because going forward, if we don't take it seriously now,
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.220]   I think at some point, there is the potential
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.100]   for a much, much larger scandal.
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.540]   - Do you agree that, like what Magnus, I think, said,
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.700]   that it is an existential threat to chess,
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.020]   like this is a very serious problem
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.900]   that's only going to get bigger?
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:41.860]   Because you're basically, from a spectator perspective,
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.180]   from a competitor perspective,
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:46.220]   are not sure that you can trust any of the results.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.420]   - Yeah, I think that's for sure true.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.980]   When I think back to the last five to 10 years,
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:52.980]   there are plenty of top-level tournaments that I played in
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.100]   where there was no security at all.
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:58.020]   You would just go into the auditorium and play your games,
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:58.860]   and that was that.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.820]   So I do think it's a big issue.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.300]   I think it has been a big issue,
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.580]   but the reason it's only coming to light now
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.460]   is because it features a very strong junior player
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.340]   who's very close to the world's elite.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.620]   There have been many cheating scandals before.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:14.060]   There was this French player, Sebastian Feller.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.860]   There was this player, Igor Zrausis, from Latvia.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.700]   There was this, I think it was from Belarus,
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.220]   or maybe I have that wrong, maybe it was Bulgaria,
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.740]   Borislav Ivanov as well.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.660]   Those are three big cheating scandals,
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.220]   but they were not at the absolute top levels of chess,
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.860]   which I think is why it never became
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.380]   the huge news story that this is,
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.140]   or it wasn't viewed in the same kind of way.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.980]   That's why I think organizers were perhaps
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.500]   a little bit too lax in terms of security.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.540]   - So you said 2,650.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.700]   Is it possible that Hans is in fact
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.300]   a kind of Bobby Fischer level of genius,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.340]   and he's capable at times of genius at the chessboard?
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.340]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.660]   100%, that is absolutely possible.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:58.940]   I think that's why I think for everybody in the situation,
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.300]   we wanna see what happens in the next six to 12 months,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.380]   because I think it will be very clear.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.940]   Also, it's very interesting to me
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.300]   because there are other stats from that 72-page report
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.740]   that chess.com compiled, which in essence,
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.380]   say certain other junior players basically have peaked,
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.180]   that they're not likely to improve further.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.300]   So it's also gonna be very interesting
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.420]   when you look at those, I think it was 50 pages of graphs,
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.540]   'cause there are graphs that say
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.020]   some of the other junior players are done.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.900]   So when we look forward in a year or two,
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.340]   if those players don't improve,
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.380]   it will also say something about their methods as well
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:34.340]   that they've used to sort of compile this data.
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.900]   - Yeah, I wonder what those junior players do
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.340]   if they look at that data.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.700]   So there's a point where you should look at yourself
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:45.700]   like practically, like what is the actual empirical data
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.820]   over the past year of how much you have improved
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.260]   at a particular thing?
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.940]   Like it's one thing to kind of tell yourself
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.420]   that these are the ways I need to improve,
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.500]   and it's another to actually look at the data
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.580]   and face the reality of it.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.420]   - Right, I think also that could have a psychological effect.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.580]   That is the other thing that makes
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.900]   the whole Han situation so tough,
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.820]   because if you think that he's cheated
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.380]   or you're unsure about what's going on,
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.540]   that is another psychological factor
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.780]   whenever you play against him.
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:15.100]   - In his favor or against him?
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.780]   - Definitely in his favor.
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.100]   Because for example, if I go online
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.100]   and play against the computer,
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.060]   let's just say I go play against Stockfish tomorrow,
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.660]   I'm gonna play a very certain type of opening strategy,
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.380]   try to keep the board closed and maybe hope to get lucky.
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.820]   Now, computers have gotten so good
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.300]   that generally even that doesn't,
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.060]   I don't even have a chance even with such strategies,
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.860]   but you play differently than you normally would.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.620]   And so if you're playing a game against him
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.940]   and there's a move that looks really weird,
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.380]   it doesn't seem logical at all,
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.700]   that can also start to affect you
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.980]   where you immediately make a mistake
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.060]   or you start questioning yourself,
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.020]   you start thinking, well, what's going on here?
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.300]   Is there something unbecoming?
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.780]   Like you start worrying about what is happening.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:56.740]   And so it definitely is, it's a very tough situation.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.460]   - Do you agree with Magnus' decision to forfeit the match,
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.540]   his most recent match with Hans?
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.540]   - Tough question.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.460]   In my heart of hearts,
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.540]   I feel like there had to be a better way to handle it
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.300]   than what Magnus did.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.700]   On the other hand, sort of being in this world
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.820]   of top grandmasters,
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.700]   having heard these rumors for two years,
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.780]   I think that the fact that it was blown off
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:20.980]   and it wasn't treated seriously,
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.820]   I'm not sure if there was a better option.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.660]   So in my heart of hearts,
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.940]   I feel like there had to be a better way to handle it,
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.940]   but in practicality, like in the practical world,
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.500]   I think he might've made the only decision
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.460]   where it became a big issue.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.180]   - Yeah, I mean, I guess I would've loved to see
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:41.580]   just where 100% it's certain that there's no cheating involved
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.780]   that they play a bunch of games.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.340]   - Yeah, I think there was actually an article
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:47.900]   that was released today by Ken Rogoff,
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.140]   who is a grandmaster at Chess,
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.380]   where he wrote this article in the Boston Globe
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.260]   and he essentially said that,
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.340]   like have Hans and Magnus play a match
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.740]   and see what his score is
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.620]   'cause statistically, if it's above a certain percentage,
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.180]   that means he's legitimate
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.020]   because of course you have security.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.420]   If it's below, that probably means
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.860]   that he's not at the level that he's at.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.300]   So I don't know if that's a real way
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.180]   to settle it necessarily
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.460]   because also for Magnus to ask him to play
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.460]   against someone who's cheated,
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.380]   I think for him, he would never entertain the idea
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.060]   'cause it's like, why am I gonna play
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.900]   against someone who cheated?
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.100]   So I don't know, it's very tough.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.980]   And one other thing I would say on the topic
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.060]   that's really important to note
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.140]   is this sort of came from left field
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.980]   for most people who are in the general public
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.820]   or very casual chess players,
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.340]   but this is not something that wasn't known,
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:34.940]   wasn't even on the radar.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.940]   I think this has not been said before,
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.580]   but there's one of these things
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.860]   where they talk about how Hans has,
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.980]   he played better during a period of time
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.220]   when games were broadcast versus not broadcast.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.380]   I actually heard this rumor two years ago
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:51.740]   during one of the terms he's playing specifically.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.820]   So that is the thing is that this has been out there
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.140]   for a very long time.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:58.220]   And so it's hard because you do believe
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.460]   that Magnus could have handled it better,
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.220]   but if it was two years of these rumors
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:04.220]   and nothing was done about it, I don't know.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.460]   - And for people who don't understand,
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.940]   when it's broadcast, it's easier to cheat
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.780]   because you can have, it removes one of the challenges
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.300]   of cheating, which is the one-way communication
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.060]   from the board to the engine.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.100]   Here, the engine can just watch the broadcast
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.140]   and then all you have to do is send signals right back.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.100]   I mean, that's really, I woken up to this fact,
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.140]   actually programmed, so setting all the silly
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:38.140]   sex toys aside, I have a bunch of these devices.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:42.340]   So like of this, it's the size of a coin
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:47.180]   and it has a high resolution vibration that you can send.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.620]   So you can just have this in your pocket.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.620]   It's basically what your smartphone has,
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:55.540]   ability to vibrate and can do programmatic communication
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.420]   through anything, Bluetooth is the easiest.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.620]   So this made me wonder, wait a minute,
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.820]   how often does this happen?
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.140]   Like at every level of play.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.260]   And you said this only became a huge concern
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.920]   for at the highest level of play,
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.700]   but then how much cheating is going on
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.700]   at the middle level of play,
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.180]   especially when more money is involved.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.340]   So in the game of poker, when like,
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:26.100]   it really made me think like the future
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.740]   will have devices like this much easier to,
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.540]   like you will engineer smaller and smaller
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:35.140]   and smaller devices that have onboard compute
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.740]   that like this is the future.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.780]   I mean, it makes me, I think probably
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.980]   with all kinds of cybersecurity,
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.620]   that means the defense will just have to get,
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.740]   start to get better.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.660]   Even with chess, it seems like the security is very clumsy.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.060]   Just looking at the scanning of the recent tournament.
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.300]   - One thing you'll see is that a lot of people
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.260]   are talking about whether Hans is a cheater or not.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:58.700]   The one thing that almost nobody is doing
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.140]   is actually like trying to show how it can be done.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.420]   Everyone's basically avoiding that.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.940]   I think the single biggest reason for that
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.740]   is simply because it can be done very easily
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.740]   at like a weekend tournament.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.180]   You play a weekend tournament where the top prize
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.260]   is a hundred dollars and the players are maybe master level.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.940]   Somebody could already do this
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.300]   because even in St. Louis now where they have the security,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.300]   my understanding is the non-linear junction device
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.260]   they bought costs about $11,000.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.020]   And organizers, if you have a weekend tournament
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.940]   at the local club, you don't have $11,000
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:31.900]   to spend on such a device.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.980]   And so that is why a lot of people
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.820]   have been talking about it,
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.380]   but I think it is very, very serious.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.700]   And that's why it is good even if,
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.740]   aside from Hans even, it is a very important question
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.940]   or debate to be having at the present moment.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.580]   - Well, I think it's good to talk about it, right?
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.300]   To make it so that the defenses will really step up.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.660]   I think you could do pretty cheap,
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.780]   like the security pretty cheaply.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.380]   But you have to take it seriously.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.140]   - Right, right, of course.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.580]   And again, we'll see what happens.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.500]   I think that's gonna end up being on FIDE
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.140]   more than anyone else to try and do that.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.260]   I don't think asking the organizers to do it.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.340]   I mean, I feel like FIDE, they are the governing body.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.020]   It will be on them at the end of the day to figure it out.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.380]   But it's gonna be interesting to see what happens
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.580]   in the next couple of months.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.540]   - Will you play Hans if the opportunity arises?
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:23.500]   - Well, right now that's not in the near future for me.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.980]   I think fortunately. - Why not?
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:25.940]   Why not?
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.140]   - Well, because there's maybe only one tournament
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.580]   that I'm playing in that he could be playing in potentially
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.380]   and it's not even set to be happening
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.220]   at the end of the year.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.100]   There might be like a World Blitz
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.740]   and Rapid Chess Championship.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.900]   So I don't think I'm gonna have to make that decision
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.740]   for at least another six months.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.540]   - What about a challenge match?
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.700]   You're one of, you're...
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.860]   (Lex laughing)
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:48.860]   The most famous super grandmaster in terms of online.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:55.620]   So it makes sense in terms of chess is going through
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.940]   a kind of like a serious controversy.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:04.340]   Since it's not just like the drama or something like this.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.420]   This is in part an existential threat to the game
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.980]   in terms of how the public perceives the game.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.740]   So if the story that lingers from this
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.500]   is chess is full of cheaters,
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.980]   like you never know who is cheating or not.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:20.220]   That's not a good, that's not good for the game.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.060]   So it makes sense for a high profile person
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.340]   to go head to head.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.700]   How do you think you'd do against Hans?
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.940]   - I mean, I think I would probably beat him
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:30.980]   in Blitz and Rapid.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.660]   Classical is a whole different question altogether.
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.820]   I think in Blitz and Rapid I would.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.480]   I mean, one thing actually that was very telling
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.540]   in both the report and also Hans' interview
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.980]   for all the other stuff that was said
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.660]   is the one thing he did say and seemed very adamant about
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.860]   was the fact that he had never cheated against me.
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:48.540]   Which, so that was the one thing he did say
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.740]   that at least according to the report was truthful.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:54.900]   So it's something possibly down the road to consider.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.100]   But I do wanna see what happens
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.180]   with everything else first with FIDE
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.500]   and whatever they choose to do
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.580]   in regards to Hans and Magnus.
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.380]   And then see where the smoke stands.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.540]   But I think also one other thing
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.500]   that is potentially very dangerous about the whole situation
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.740]   is that I'm not convinced that FIDE
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.860]   actually has the ultimate say in this
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.220]   in that the top players,
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.920]   if they feel that he has cheated over the board,
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.620]   even if there's a report that says he has,
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.940]   that Hans has not cheated,
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.360]   top players can still decide not to play him
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.780]   and sort of override whatever ultimate decision
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:29.620]   FIDE comes to.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.420]   So that's also why it's very unclear.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.180]   You know, this term, the US Championship, Hans qualified.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.340]   He's playing the tournament.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.860]   But beyond this, there are no tournaments
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.060]   where he's automatically qualified to.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.600]   And so it also is on the top players
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.180]   to sort of have to reach some conclusion
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.740]   on their own separate defeating.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:51.800]   - So to flip that, is there some part of you
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.800]   that regrets that the chess community and you included
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.260]   implied that Hans cheated early on?
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.940]   And I think without having evidence
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:05.740]   and that kind of thing as we learn now,
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.660]   can stick, right?
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.920]   And it kind of divided the chess community in part,
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.760]   but like,
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.780]   I mean, I guess I do want to empathize.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:20.100]   From your position, can you empathize with Hans
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.100]   that his reputation is essentially in part
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.380]   or in whole destroyed at this point?
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.100]   - Yes, I absolutely can.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.220]   Again, I think it comes down to the specifics
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.780]   of how it was handled.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.300]   Now, as far as I go, I was covering the news
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.660]   and this is what makes it so difficult for me
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.760]   versus say some of the other content creators
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.600]   is that I do in a sense have that inside knowledge.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.520]   Again, this is also not really public knowledge,
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.060]   but when I went to St. Louis
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.780]   to play this Rapid and Blitz tournament
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:49.940]   before the Sinkfield Cup happened
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:51.380]   where Magus and Hans were playing,
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:53.240]   there were people who told me very specifically
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.420]   that they thought he was cheating.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.680]   Other players in the event,
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.940]   they even gave me like actual theories
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.520]   about like things in his shoes, things of this nature.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.060]   So I'm in a very awkward spot there as well
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.020]   because I know why, I mean, I was like 99% sure
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.640]   why Magnus dropped out.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.440]   It would have come out regardless though.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.020]   It would have come out no matter what
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.100]   because Magnus was not gonna back down
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.260]   on his stance about Hans
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:19.300]   and others would have brought it up anyways.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.220]   So it's very tough.
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.840]   I think if you wanna look for blame,
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.280]   I think probably it would be on chess.com ultimately
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.020]   because they were the ones
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.980]   who probably could have nipped all this in the bud
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.500]   at a much earlier stage
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.260]   and it wouldn't have gotten to where it got to.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.620]   - Because they could have released the online cheating
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.780]   and that would have.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:41.060]   - I think, yeah, I think they could have released that.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.180]   I think also they could have probably not let him play
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.740]   after it happened the second time as well
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.340]   because it seems like it happened like,
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:50.500]   I think it was like at least like four
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.700]   or five different times.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.620]   I haven't looked very, very closely at that
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.260]   but it wasn't just an isolated incident.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.500]   And so I think if there is blame for that,
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.920]   it's definitely on chess.com
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.660]   which should stop people from thinking
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.420]   that I'm in some way influenced by--
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.540]   - Yeah, are you biased
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.100]   because are you supported in part by chess.com?
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:09.940]   - Yes, I am.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:10.780]   I am.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.700]   - So does that affect your bias?
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.540]   - No, it doesn't.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.300]   I'm actually quite independent of them.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.260]   One thing that's interesting to note
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:20.280]   is that a lot of people are under the assumption
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.980]   that when I do like broadcasts of tournaments
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:22.980]   or things of this nature
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.060]   that chess.com is actively helping me.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.260]   They are not helping me.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:27.820]   I'm an independent contractor
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.740]   and so my opinions are my own.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.000]   And there are no lists given to me
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.160]   about like cheaters, anything of this nature.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.300]   That has always been completely separate.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.800]   - Do they have compromising video of you
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.860]   that forces you to,
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.440]   if you don't follow the main narrative
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.680]   that they will release that video publicly?
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.120]   - No, they definitely don't.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.120]   But yeah, I think when I look at it all,
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.960]   I feel like if people are looking for someone to blame,
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.520]   I don't think it's actually Magnus.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.360]   At the end of the day,
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.560]   I think it is on chess.com very squarely
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.960]   for not handling it sooner.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.200]   - So you're okay with like Magnus being silent
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.440]   for long periods of time?
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.040]   - Well, I don't know why Magnus is still silent
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.760]   because my read of the situation
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.320]   was that there was some sort of NDA
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.360]   or there was some information that chess.com had
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.600]   that they could not release.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.680]   And so my read of it was Magnus was essentially saying
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.160]   the same thing chess.com said
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.120]   where like, I can't say anything about it
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.640]   because of whatever or whatnot.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.440]   But then chess.com releases what I perceive to be
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.920]   the stuff that they could not talk about anyway.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.720]   And Magnus still isn't saying anything.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.940]   So I don't really understand
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.880]   why Magnus has not said anything further on.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.640]   - There could be legal implications
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.280]   of accusing somebody of cheating over the board.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.760]   That could be like lawsuits
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.080]   that he just doesn't want the headaches.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.440]   He just wants to focus on the game
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.760]   and have fun playing the game
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.360]   and not get bogged down into lawyers
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.200]   and all that kind of bullshit.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.560]   - Yeah, it's definitely possible.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.960]   But Magnus could also take the other route
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.160]   and just say, well, he cheated online in 100 games.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.560]   Like I'm not gonna play against a cheater.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.640]   That's very easy to say.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.520]   That's factual, it's proven.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.840]   And that doesn't have to go into the speculation
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.680]   of over the board.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.840]   So I find it a little bit odd
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.360]   that Magnus hasn't said anything further.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.400]   At the same time, it's also kind of peculiar
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.440]   because Magnus' reputation
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.900]   is also kind of in tatters in a sense.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.520]   Like a lot of people are not happy with him
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.920]   for what he's done.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.520]   But still, he goes and plays this tournament
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.520]   in this European Club Cup tournament
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.160]   and he's just gaining like 10 points
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.240]   as though nothing has happened.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.800]   So I mean, I don't really know where Magnus' head is at
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.320]   'cause like if I was in that situation
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.940]   and everyone's coming after me for making such an accusation,
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.760]   I don't think there's any way I would be able to play chess
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.920]   anywhere near the level that Magnus is playing at.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.040]   So the whole situation is, yeah, it's very strange.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.120]   - Yeah, I wonder where his mind is at
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.280]   that he's able to play at that level.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.040]   Before I forget, let me ask you a technical question
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.880]   about cheating at your level.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.120]   Not your level, but at a very high Grandmaster level.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.140]   How much information do you need?
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.600]   This is a technical question.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.760]   It's like, so for me, in terms of Morse code
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.960]   and all those kinds of things,
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.840]   I would need the full information.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.660]   So I would need probably, in order to make a move,
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:19.480]   just let's think about a very simple representation.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.200]   I would need two squares.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.360]   The first to designate which piece
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.320]   and the second where the piece is moving.
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.400]   That's probably the easiest.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.760]   What's the smallest amount of information
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.760]   you need to help you?
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.200]   - Basically like a buzz in a critical position.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.120]   That would be good. - And what would the buzz say?
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.640]   - It would, basically it'd be something like
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.360]   one buzz means the position is great
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.200]   and two buzzes means the position is completely equal
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.280]   or there's nothing special in the position.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.640]   That simple. - Oh, so just to know
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.800]   that it's great will tell you what?
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.920]   - It will tell me that with my intuition.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.440]   There are many times I've played Blitz online,
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.600]   I'll say something along the lines of,
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.920]   I can feel like there's something here.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.160]   Intuitively, I feel like there has to be a good move
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160]   or I'm probably winning.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.760]   There's something there, but I don't know that.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.840]   And most of the time, I'm actually right about it.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.120]   After the game, when I look with the computer,
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.140]   usually it's like, oh, I should have played this move
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.840]   and it would have given me a big advantage
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.380]   or I would have outright won the game.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.840]   So if I just know whether there's something there,
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.680]   that's good enough.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.280]   - That means it's worth it to calculate here.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.480]   - Yes, and I can follow that intuition probably to,
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.520]   'cause what normally is gonna happen in such a situation
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.960]   is there probably are two moves or three moves max
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.320]   that you're gonna consider in a really critical position.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.660]   Like if I feel like there's something there,
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.800]   there are two to three moves.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.360]   So if I know something is there,
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.000]   I'll be able to figure it out
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.800]   if I know that the position is very good.
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.360]   - Okay, one buzz for a good position.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.200]   For the current position, not for the next position.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.240]   - So I just need to know.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.800]   I just need to know whether there's something really good,
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.960]   the position's really good,
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.600]   or it's just like an equal position or it's just normal.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.440]   That's all I need to know.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.200]   - So the current position, not even future moves,
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.400]   just the current position, there is a lot of promise here.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.240]   - Yes.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.680]   - Okay.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.160]   What about the reverse, like something's bad?
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.680]   - So you're saying if I'm in trouble in a game
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.740]   and I am in the same situation.
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.580]   So if I'm in trouble in a game,
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.720]   it's probably a little bit more.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.300]   It's probably like, I would say two to three times
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.280]   where I would need to know.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.280]   - The source of the trouble.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.560]   - Yeah, I would need to know.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560]   Yeah, I would need to know,
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.880]   is there one move that's good
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.760]   or there's more than one move?
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   Again, how you extrapolate that.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.800]   - Well, wouldn't it be useful to know the information
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.240]   that you're now in a position where the other person
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.920]   could create a lot of trouble for you?
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.760]   So find that.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.200]   Like, it's out there, find it.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.600]   - Like if you look at Magnus' games,
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.040]   there are a lot of situations where the position is equal,
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.160]   but it's equal with one move, but only one move.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.680]   If you don't find that one move, you're significantly worse.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.240]   A lot of times that's the case.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.840]   So like, if I can somehow know that there's like
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.080]   only one move where I'm okay, I could figure it out.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:54.920]   - Yeah.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.120]   Yeah, so that's one move is significantly better
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.840]   than the rest.
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.080]   - I mean, I could give you like a perfect example
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.980]   as I played a game in the Canada's tournament last round
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.720]   against Ding Liren from China.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.200]   And there were many times where it was completely fine
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.640]   for me, but it started drifting.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.240]   I started making some mistakes and I was worse,
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.080]   but there was one last moment where I think I had one move
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.760]   where I would have been able to draw the game quite easily.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.480]   And every other move I was significantly worse.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.520]   I did not find that move and I lost the game.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.360]   But if I had known-
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.280]   - It would have been nice to have a buzz there then.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.880]   - Yes, I would have known.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.960]   - Who do you think is the greatest player of all time?
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.840]   You've talked from different angles on this.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.440]   Magnus Carlsen, Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, many others.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.100]   Can you make the case for each?
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.040]   Can you make the case for you?
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.040]   - No, I mean, I can't make the case for me, be serious.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.920]   I know there are a lot of people who want that kind of like
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.480]   me to give off some kind of ego like that, but no.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.560]   Obviously I'm nowhere near the conversation.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.800]   I actually, on that note, I would say also,
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.080]   I know people wanted to know if I'm the greatest player
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.560]   to never have played for the world championship
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.860]   or to have not become world champion.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.800]   I don't think that I'm actually anywhere near the top
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.120]   of that conversation.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.020]   I actually think Levon Aronian tops that conversation
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.360]   by a big margin, simply because he was number two
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.320]   in the world for a very, very long time.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.000]   And he never even got to the match.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.980]   So as far as world champions and who's the GOAT,
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:19.980]   I think Magnus is the GOAT simply because he's playing
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.080]   the best chess by a bigger margin.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.240]   He has the highest ELO of all time.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.840]   On the other hand, chess is a game where you build upon
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.240]   the giants of the past.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.120]   We learn from them.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.920]   And so you can definitely make the case for Gary as well.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.200]   I mean, he was the number one player in the world
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.580]   for 20 plus years.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.240]   Lot of opening strategies he came up with
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.740]   and people still play them today.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.720]   Bobby, I'm not so sure you can really make that case
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.840]   'cause he shot up really quickly,
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.940]   but he was the world champion for a very short window
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.780]   of time.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.740]   And then he quit the game as soon as he became
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:55.580]   world champion.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.940]   So I don't really feel like you can put Fisher
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:01.840]   in that conversation simply because he didn't have
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.160]   that longevity at all.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.920]   He was up there for a couple of years.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.000]   So I would say it's probably Magnus,
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.440]   but I understand people can also say Gary's the best player
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.360]   ever, remains to be seen.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.040]   But I think if Magnus is number one for probably
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.100]   another, let's say another three to four years,
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.100]   I don't think there's any debate at all.
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.600]   - Can you break down what makes him so good?
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.760]   We've already talked about different angles of this
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:29.180]   and then I would also try to get the same from you
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:31.440]   'cause we talked about early Hikaru.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.520]   Like I'd like to talk about that for, but first Magnus,
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.800]   what makes Magnus so good?
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.760]   What are the various aspects of his game
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.000]   that make him so good?
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.200]   - I think for Magnus, he just,
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.240]   you know that in the end games, if you get there,
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.840]   he's just, he's not gonna blunder.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.680]   That's the first thing.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.100]   So you know, if you reach an end game,
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:50.520]   he's not gonna make a mistake.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.960]   He obviously plays great openings
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.640]   and there's just really no defined weakness that he has.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.400]   There's no weakness that I can think of very specifically.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.120]   Many, there are many times where players actually
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.840]   out-prepare him in the opening phase,
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.840]   but as soon as they're on their own and they have to think,
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.520]   very oftentimes they'll make mistakes.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:12.000]   So there's just no weakness for Magnus, really no weakness.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.480]   - Well, unlike say Kasparov, like Kasparov on the other hand,
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.880]   there are very clear weaknesses in his game,
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.920]   like Kramnik exploited them.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:22.260]   First of all, very, I don't wanna say like,
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.480]   ego is the right word, but like very stubborn,
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.560]   believing that his openings were infallible,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.080]   that he could just win, he could just prove an advantage
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.720]   and win the game out of the opening,
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.000]   like against Kramnik when he ultimately lost.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.900]   Also generally not a great defender either,
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.660]   very strong tactically,
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.240]   but if he was in positions that were defensive,
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.000]   he would make mistakes and lose in end games,
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.880]   like he did in one of those games
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.440]   in the World Championship against Kramnik.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.840]   So there were very clear defined weaknesses
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.560]   in Kasparov's game, whereas like Magnus,
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.200]   there are just, there are no clearly defined weaknesses.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.320]   Maybe he doesn't like being attacked.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.800]   Maybe that's the one thing.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.000]   He likes King safety and he doesn't like being attacked,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.900]   but that's not something that you can easily do.
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.400]   Whereas say, if someone's very tactical
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.800]   and they're not as strong positionally,
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.240]   that is something you can def,
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.160]   that will happen quite frequently in games.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.880]   You can steer games a certain way.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.200]   Doesn't mean you'll always get there,
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.040]   but that is something tangible.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.080]   Whereas King safety, that's not something tangible at all.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.740]   It's very, very hard to attack someone
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:20.660]   based on, unless they play certain style of openings.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:23.480]   - Do you think Garry Kasparov,
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.600]   reflecting on your comment would agree?
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:29.400]   Like, what is it about his relationship with Kramnik
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.080]   that was so challenging?
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.140]   - I mean, I think it's 'cause Kramnik understood him.
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:36.280]   Actually, one thing that's funny speaking of Kasparov
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.280]   is that I think it got under his skin.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.640]   Like when I worked with him,
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.760]   Kramnik actually played a certain style,
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.720]   very aggressive, very sort of risky opening play
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.880]   during the time when I was working with Garry.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.200]   And I know that it annoyed Garry
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.040]   because he's like,
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.880]   "Why couldn't Kramnik play like this against me?"
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.860]   Because I think Garry felt if Kramnik did that against him,
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.320]   he would have just blown him off the board
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.880]   and had many great victories.
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:00.720]   So I think it's Kramnik understood Garry.
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:03.360]   They had worked together, I think, during the late '90s.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.760]   I think Garry actually was very useful or very helpful
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.000]   in terms of Kramnik getting a spot
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.680]   on one of the Russian Chess Olympiad teams in the mid '90s.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.800]   So I think it's just Kramnik understood him very well
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.320]   and Garry just could not, he couldn't figure it out.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.120]   And I think also another thing,
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.520]   coming back to the psychological part,
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.920]   is that Kramnik actually beat Kasparov in many games
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.400]   in the Kings Indian defense.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.800]   Kasparov played the Kings Indian defense for many years
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.560]   and then he started losing like four or five games
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.680]   in a row in it to Kramnik,
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.040]   very similar to what I mentioned
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.160]   about the Sicilian Eidorff and Fabiano.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.060]   And Garry gave it up.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.360]   He started switching to playing the Grunfeld defense.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.780]   And so I think that also instilled
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:41.760]   some psychological fear as well,
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.400]   because Garry was, he was the boss.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.800]   In openings, no one could compare to him.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.720]   - What makes you so good?
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:54.520]   What's the breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.240]   of Fikaro Nakamura?
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.480]   - So that's, I think probably my biggest strength
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.960]   is that I'm a universal player.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.640]   I can play pretty much any opening strategy.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.140]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.560]   Beyond that, I think it's mainly that
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.640]   I don't really make many blunders.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.480]   I don't make blunders
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.720]   unless I'm under a lot of pressure generally.
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.920]   So, I mean, I know I'm oversimplifying.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.120]   It's not as simple as that.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:22.400]   - Does this apply to blitz as well?
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.600]   - I think it's much more applicable to blitz in particular
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.960]   because my intuition is very good.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:28.300]   So when I'm making less blunders
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.920]   with limited time on the clock,
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.720]   my opponents actually make a lot more blunders.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.200]   That's why I think it's much more pronounced
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.040]   in blitz than it is in classical chess
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.480]   because in blitz, when you're down to like 10 seconds
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.280]   in the game, both players have 10 seconds,
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.360]   my intuition is just better than theirs.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.880]   I mean, Magnus maybe not so clear,
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.420]   but like if you look at other players,
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.520]   say Fabian and Karjuan, a very strong player,
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.740]   when he gets down to 10 seconds or in these situations,
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.440]   he almost always makes a blunder, almost always.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.840]   So I'm just more precise, I make less blunders.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.600]   And that really, the effect is much more dramatic in blitz.
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.760]   - What do you think that intuition is?
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.740]   Like, sorry for the kind of,
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.640]   like almost philosophical question.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.960]   What is that?
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.200]   Is that calculation?
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.240]   Or is it some kind of weird memory recall?
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.080]   What is that?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.680]   Like being able to do that short line prediction.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.560]   - I think that's just playing so many games online
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.000]   and there's some kind of subconscious feel that I have.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.040]   Because when you're that low on time, you can't calculate.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.840]   It's just, you have to look, you just have to figure out
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.120]   what's the move you want to play as,
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.960]   no calculation and just go with it.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.780]   And I think just playing so many games probably,
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:41.480]   I mean, I'm guessing I've played over 300,000 games online.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:44.360]   And I think just playing all those games, it's a feel.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:48.160]   There's no tangible way that I can't put that
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.480]   really into words, it's just a feel.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:52.440]   - What do you, and we should say that you're,
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.760]   I think currently the number one ranked blitz player
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:55.640]   in the world.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:00.600]   You have been for a while, you're unquestionably
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.680]   one of the great, so classical, rapid and blitz,
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.080]   you're one of the best people for many years in the world.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.680]   Okay, but you're currently number one in blitz.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:15.960]   So I'd love to kind of, for you to dig into the secret
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.020]   to your success in blitz.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:21.120]   Is it, as you're saying that intuition,
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.060]   being able to, when the time is short,
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:27.520]   to not make blunders and then to make a close to optimal move
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:31.600]   - I think it's generally that I'm able to keep the games
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:34.400]   going no matter what, until we're low on time.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.400]   I'm always able to do that.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.800]   Like if we play a game with three minutes,
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.480]   like there are games I will just win very quickly,
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.940]   but a lot of games between top players,
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.600]   players have to think you have to use time.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.840]   And in those final critical stages, I just don't blunder.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   I just don't blunder really at the end of the day.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.800]   That's really the only difference.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.140]   'Cause everybody's very, very strong,
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:57.020]   but it's sort of like, who is the better brain?
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:00.220]   Who is better CPU, for lack of a better way of putting it?
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:04.100]   It's like, who makes a split second decisions the best?
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:07.860]   And I do think that I'm extremely good at that
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.820]   in a way that almost nobody else is.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.300]   That really is the only difference,
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.980]   is that the split second decisions.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.380]   'Cause you can get a worse position,
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:15.840]   but again, if you keep the game going,
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.700]   players have to use the time when you get down
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.660]   to those final 10, 15 seconds.
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:22.640]   I almost always end up winning in those situations.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.040]   - What are you visualizing?
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.840]   Like in those, when you're doing the fast, fast calculations,
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.760]   what is it?
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.500]   - It's basically, you look at a move and you see,
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.080]   like when it's like five seconds or 10 seconds,
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.220]   you play a move and you just make sure
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:36.060]   that it's not a blunder.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:37.880]   You just look, make sure it's not a blunder
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.760]   and you just go with it.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.940]   And the first part though is the feel.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.760]   So it's like, I see this move and it looks right.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.800]   I don't know why it's right.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.040]   I can't put that into words,
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.160]   but it looks like the right move.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.160]   And then I look very, for like a split second,
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.800]   see as long as it's not some kind of blunder
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.260]   and you just play that move.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.640]   - Is there a bit of a tunnel vision?
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.360]   Are you able to understand the positions
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.640]   of all the other pieces on the board
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.280]   or are you just focusing it on a very specific interaction?
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.920]   - It's just feel, it's really just feel.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.340]   It's like this move feels right.
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:01.360]   And so I play it.
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:02.840]   When you're at that stage of the game,
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.200]   it's like, as long as it's not a blunder
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.000]   and it's just that feel,
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.560]   there is no way for me to put that into words.
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:14.300]   - And that feel, like empirically does result
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.800]   in low probability of blunder for you.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.400]   - Yeah. - It's like you don't blunder.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.720]   Even though there could be,
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:23.360]   like you don't forget like a random piece that was like-
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:26.660]   - I mean, it does happen of course, but very rarely.
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.000]   And I mean, I've done it on stream many times.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.960]   Like it's just, you go with the move
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.200]   that for whatever reason, like it just intuitively,
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.600]   whether it's from playing hundreds of thousands of games
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.600]   on the internet or just that experience,
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.280]   like you just intuitively can feel like the move is right.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.440]   - So over those 300,000 games played over the board,
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.480]   online, all kinds of variations,
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.240]   what's a game that stands out to you
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.760]   as particularly one you're proud of?
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.320]   Or maybe what's the Hikaru Immortal game
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.040]   or a strong candidate for that?
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.240]   - Yeah, so there are two games.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.120]   There's a game that I won against Boris Gelfand in 2010
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.660]   where I offered a queen sack,
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.320]   I think on five consecutive moves.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.560]   - Sack is sacrifice.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.680]   - Sacrifice the queen, yeah.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.840]   - Yes. - So.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.960]   - Coming through with the lingo.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.560]   You can't take me to that game?
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.720]   - It's just, there's one sequence in the late middle game
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.960]   where, it's funny 'cause I actually,
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.820]   I think I, 'cause I remember I tried to show this game
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.560]   to Peter actually, Peter Till,
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:27.360]   and I confused the move order in the late middle game,
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.920]   so I don't wanna do that again.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.880]   - 2010?
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:31.440]   - Yeah, 2010, it was, yeah.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.280]   - What kind of opening is this?
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.200]   - It's the King's Indian Defense.
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:40.000]   - So the knights are out.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.640]   What's with the bringing the knight back?
[01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.000]   - You wanna push the pawn. - Who's black and white?
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.600]   - I have the black pieces and you wanna push the pawn.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.000]   - The, make room for the pawn.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.080]   - Yeah, normally in the King's Indian,
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.400]   you try to, it's sort of like storming with the pawns
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.240]   on the king side where the white king is.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.320]   So you see now, I push and I start pushing
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.440]   all my pawns forward.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.600]   - Are you happy with this position
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.440]   with all the pawns in diagonal like this
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.520]   with the knights behind it?
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.320]   This looks pretty. - This is, this is,
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.600]   this is, this, nowadays this is very well known
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.280]   as a standard theory, but at the time,
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.640]   the reason that I was aware of this
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.960]   is 'cause I had played a tournament, I think, in Montreal.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.360]   I think it was Montreal, like the year, the summer before,
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.640]   and one of my friends had actually played this variation
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:18.480]   with the black pieces.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.880]   So I was aware of it and it seemed very dangerous.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.080]   But I-- - From the black perspective.
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.440]   - Yeah, I feel like it's very hard for white to play.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.720]   Yeah, very hard for white to play.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.800]   It feels like you're getting attacked,
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.640]   your king, you see the black pawns are coming down
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.800]   towards the king and it's very hard to defend.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.760]   And also, a lot of players don't like being attacked.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.440]   Generally, you try to avoid positions
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.880]   where your king is under fire,
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:41.280]   which comes back to what I said about Magnus as well.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:44.000]   Like he doesn't like it when his king is under fire.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   And so therefore, you can't always get that.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.280]   But you see, white had to play along
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.600]   to get to this point as well.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.840]   If white didn't want something this double-edged
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.920]   and this complicated, he could have avoided it.
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.040]   - So is the black bishop also a threat?
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.280]   Are you like-- - Yes, the light square bishop
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.640]   in the King's Indian is vital to any attacking possibility.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.040]   - So you're always like--
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.440]   - You don't wanna lose that bishop if you can help it.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.160]   - Got it, and so he's bringing out the knights.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:13.880]   Is there a particular moment that's interesting to you here
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.240]   so that-- - So keep going.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.960]   Yeah, there's, so I play rook F7.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.440]   This is all standard.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.600]   - The rooks come out. - So I take, take.
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.240]   Now this is actually, this is an exception to the rule.
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.600]   Normally, the King's Indian,
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.280]   you don't wanna break this pawn chain
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.880]   from at least the four pawns in a row that connect four.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.120]   - Why'd you break it?
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.800]   - Because this is an exception where you can do that.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.920]   There almost are no variations in the King's Indian
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.760]   where you do that.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.840]   You almost always retreat the bishop to guard the pawn,
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.880]   the bishop to F8.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.720]   You break the pawn chain
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.440]   'cause it's an exception to the rule
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.720]   because you're not actually worried
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.160]   about white being able to push the pawn to D6 here.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.640]   It was probably the best game I ever played,
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.200]   so it keeps going.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.480]   A5, G4, yep.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:58.880]   - No, no, no, the diagonal's there again.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.360]   That looks threatening.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.800]   - Right, like white basically is trying to guard the King.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.280]   He's gonna retreat this bishop from C5 to G1,
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.240]   as you'll see in a second.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.160]   Actually, not quite yet.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.920]   Yeah, he goes, now he goes here.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.400]   And so he's trying to guard his King
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.960]   with the bishop on G1,
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.360]   but I'm able to keep attacking here in the next--
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.200]   - Is there any case to be made
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:22.600]   for you to take the pawn here?
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:24.160]   - No, that would actually be a mistake.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.280]   I mean, it's very high level,
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.600]   but it's a mistake 'cause white
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.520]   will actually not recapture the pawn.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:32.520]   Yeah, this is very high level.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.680]   - Oh, so the pawn is--
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:36.120]   - The pawn ends up in front of the King, yeah.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.800]   It stops the white King from being attacked, basically.
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:40.680]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:45.040]   So your pawn is stopping their King from being attacked.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.040]   Cool.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:46.880]   - So yeah, so it just goes on.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.400]   - So the pressure continues from you.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.960]   - Right, and then I sack.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:52.760]   - Is that, wait, wait, what's the sack?
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.640]   Oh, the-- - Knight takes pawn, yeah.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.960]   - Is this, what are the strengths and weaknesses
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.040]   of you throwing the Knight into the abyss?
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.160]   - Well, basically I'm gonna,
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.440]   I'm destroying the protection in front of the white King,
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.680]   the white pawn's there.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.920]   - And willing to take risks by placing--
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.440]   - I basically wanna open up the King
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.280]   and try to checkmate.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.080]   If I don't checkmate, I'm probably gonna lose the game here
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.080]   in the center of the board.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.120]   So yeah, and now there's some very nice moves
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.280]   after pawn takes pawn.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.080]   I take this, 'cause now white takes the Queen.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.240]   I push the pawn forward and it's checkmate.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.720]   - So give me a second.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.280]   So your Knight is taking,
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:32.520]   you're losing pieces left and right.
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.360]   - Right, but--
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.160]   - And you're pushing the pawn forward, check.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.600]   He takes the pawn.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.160]   - The rook, check.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.200]   So just check nonstop.
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.520]   - Yeah, now same thing, though.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.960]   I keep going for this checkmate with a pawn or a bishop on,
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.720]   on the square in front of the King.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.920]   You see the Queen is still hanging.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.960]   In fact, I actually sack the Queen again.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.880]   - He never took the Queen.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.160]   - He couldn't take the Queen, 'cause it'd be checkmate.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.000]   - Got it.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.880]   So constantly, and that's what you mean by sacrifice,
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.320]   you didn't actually, but there was--
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.920]   - Yeah, he couldn't take it, he would've gotten checkmated.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.400]   But anyway, the smoke clears and I'm up material here
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.920]   and I win this game.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.160]   So this is the game that I would say is my favorite game.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.840]   - Why did it stand out?
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.040]   I mean, it's beautiful, but just the fact that--
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.680]   - It's mainly that I was able to offer the Queen sacrifice
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.920]   so many moves in a row,
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.880]   you almost never have that opportunity.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.120]   And actually, normally the games you're gonna consider
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:27.200]   your best involve sacrifices,
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.440]   and if you can sacrifice the Queen,
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.080]   that makes it very memorable.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:33.880]   It's just this constant theme of this one checkmate idea.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.920]   - How often do you play with the sacrifice
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.200]   of a major piece?
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.200]   Like how often do you find yourself in that position?
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.280]   - Pretty rare, because players tend to avoid
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:44.640]   these sorts of situations.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.920]   Players don't like games that can go either way.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.600]   So when, like both players have to sort of cooperate,
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.640]   you have to want that kind of game
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.920]   in order for that situation to arise.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.720]   And a lot of games at the top,
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.880]   neither player wants to go into that situation
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.720]   for the most part.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:03.200]   So you don't really have those opportunities.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.640]   - Nevertheless, Stockfish loves those opportunities,
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.120]   the sacrifices.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.240]   - Well, that's one thing also
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.120]   that we're starting to learn more and more
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.120]   is that Stockfish and the other programs,
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.280]   they don't care about pawns.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.800]   You can sacrifice one pawn, two pawns, three pawns
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:19.920]   in a lot of cases,
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.160]   if the rest of your pieces are very active.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.880]   And that's something that we kind of knew on a basic level
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.480]   about the initiative is what we call it in chess,
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.560]   where like you'll give up material,
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:30.200]   but your pieces are very well placed.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.840]   But we didn't realize just how important that is,
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.480]   and computers will do that all the time now, all the time.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.840]   And even actually like they're in this variant,
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.560]   Fisher random is another variant
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.240]   where you arrange a piece on the back row.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.960]   They will gladly sack rooks for bishops or for knights
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.920]   all the time, all the time.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:46.760]   And so-
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.440]   - What do you take from that?
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.800]   - Material imbalance or the material you give up
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.720]   doesn't matter as much as having this attack
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.080]   or having this piece on certain squares.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.840]   - Well, as long as you can hold on to the attack.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.160]   - Right, and computers can't.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.640]   But it's also very tricky
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.240]   'cause when we as humans sometimes,
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.120]   you'll look at an opening variation
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.360]   and you'll see something like this
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.560]   and you want to do it in a game.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.800]   But the problem is we don't know
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.440]   how we're supposed to follow it up afterwards.
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.800]   And so if you do that
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.480]   and you don't know how to follow up afterwards,
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.400]   very oftentimes we'll make mistakes.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.680]   We'll try to look at it in a human way.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.560]   And then of course, you end up losing in the longterm
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.960]   'cause you've given up too much material.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.800]   So it's a very double-edged sword.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.960]   - But that's why it's dramatic
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.120]   and why people love those kinds of sacrifices
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.560]   'cause you're putting it all on the line.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.120]   What's the other game?
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.600]   - It was a game also with a queen sacrifice.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.560]   It was a game against this Polish player,
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.280]   Michael Krasenkow.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:41.600]   It was played in Barcelona in 2007, I believe it was.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.120]   I also, I sacrificed a queen for one pawn
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.880]   to just bring the king out into the middle of the board.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.240]   - You actually sacrificed it?
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.200]   - Yes, I did sacrifice.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.040]   I took a pawn.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:50.880]   - Did you want to go with that game?
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.400]   - Sure, yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.880]   - And you're again black.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:55.800]   - Yes.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.440]   Yeah, this game you can just skip forward
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.080]   to about like the 20th move roughly.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.960]   - What's the opening?
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.080]   - This is, I think it's like a Catalan.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.000]   It says Neo-Catalan.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.600]   So yeah, it's basically a Catalan opening,
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.080]   generally very slow.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.640]   - Neo-Catalan declined?
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.480]   - Yeah.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.200]   Yeah, and now here I sack the queen for the pawn.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.600]   Or no, sorry, I take the knight first.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.080]   Sorry, knight c6, keep going.
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:24.080]   - So, by the way, the pawn structure here is a mess
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.480]   or is missing.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.080]   - Yeah, so I take the knight.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.160]   - You take the knight with a rook.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.840]   What's the discovery?
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.320]   - My queen's under attack now.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.280]   So when he takes the knight,
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.160]   the rook on b1 is attacking my queen.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.080]   - Got it, so the, got it?
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.120]   - Now, yeah.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.120]   - You throw your queen into the middle,
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.400]   check, check the king.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.560]   Wait a minute, that's not right.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.400]   - Yeah, it's one pawn.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.600]   It's a queen for a pawn.
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.200]   - For a pawn.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.980]   And the king takes your queen.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.460]   - What was the thinking here?
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.420]   You crazy madman.
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:06.500]   - King has to go up the board
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.140]   and the king is very vulnerable.
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:09.180]   - In this position, see,
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:11.500]   but you're gonna have to keep checking here then.
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:12.340]   - Yes.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:17.340]   - Bishop checks, king, rook checks, knight checks.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:22.180]   Did you see all of this ahead of time?
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:24.100]   - Yeah, I mean, not all of it,
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:26.020]   but I figured there had to be some way
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:27.300]   to win here with the king.
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:30.940]   - Too many attacking pieces on your end that could do.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.380]   - Well, it's just basically the king,
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:34.260]   the only piece that can sort of guard the king
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.180]   is the queen on d1.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.020]   That's the only piece.
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:37.660]   If I can just keep checking,
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.420]   I'm gonna be able to win here.
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.260]   So it goes there.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.340]   And now I think I played, yeah, I played this move.
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.660]   - Ooh, no check.
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.500]   - 'Cause I'm threatening to move the rook over one square
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:46.620]   and make a checkmate.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.020]   - Got it.
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:49.300]   And then the rook, what was that?
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.700]   The rook takes your knight
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:55.680]   and then you take it right back with a check.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.920]   - No, I still wanna scoot the rook over
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.840]   to check on the h6 square, the dark square.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.640]   I think, did he resign here or did he make a move?
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.280]   - Oh, he resigned, yeah.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.220]   - He did resign here, yeah,
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:08.680]   because I just moved the rook over
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.160]   to that dark square in front of the pawn
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.920]   and that would be checkmate.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.800]   - Dark square in front of the pawn over here.
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.960]   - It's h6, yeah.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.640]   'Cause now the bishop covers the light square.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.640]   - Is there something he can do to mess with it?
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:20.720]   - Not really.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.080]   I don't think there's any way to stop a checkmate.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:24.000]   - Nothing with the queen.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.960]   I guess he's gonna lose the queen.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.080]   - Yeah, I think it's just actually forced checkmate
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.100]   here on a couple of moves.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.720]   I don't think there's any way to stop it.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.880]   - Even if he loses his queens.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.820]   - Yeah, it's a forced checkmate.
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.540]   - Fascinating.
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:40.340]   So like that, you can't purely calculate,
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:42.240]   but you can have some intuition.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.840]   - Also, I think what it is is in such situations,
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.760]   you know that there is at least a draw.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.720]   I could always just check him with my rook
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.200]   if I wanted to, to make a draw.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.800]   So that also gives me some margin
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:53.720]   where if I calculate, after I play the move
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.120]   and I calculate it doesn't work out,
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.420]   I can still make the draw.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:59.520]   - Are you, I mean, for fun,
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.960]   do you do the sacrifices of this sort?
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.140]   - When it's not the serious competitive online events
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:07.720]   or over the board, I do actually do this quite frequently.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.280]   And I wish there were more opportunities,
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:12.520]   but top level chess, it's become harder and harder
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.320]   because due to computers,
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.360]   everybody's very, very well prepared in the opening.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:19.440]   They know the first like 15 to 20 moves sequences
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.980]   in no matter what you do.
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.200]   So it's very, the room for creativity is less and less,
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.240]   which makes it, which means you have less,
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.160]   less of those types of games.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:32.400]   - I think you played Levy, Gotham chess
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.520]   with the, without a queen.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.360]   Was that a thing?
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.180]   - I think that was a bullet game.
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.020]   Yeah, the one minute game.
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:37.840]   I think so, yeah.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.960]   - Is that an actual thing that you can pull off?
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.240]   Like would you be like Levy or?
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.640]   - Yeah, I guess somebody like Levy.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.080]   - In bullet, maybe I can win like 50%.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:45.920]   It'll probably be.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:46.920]   - What's bullet, what's the timing?
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.120]   - One minute for the whole game.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.760]   - One minute for the whole game.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:53.380]   Okay, what about, I mean, how much do you miss the queen
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:56.120]   if it's gone against the international master?
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.660]   - You know, in a bullet game, like I said,
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:00.900]   maybe in bullet I can maybe score 50%
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:04.860]   in a blitz game or anything slower, maybe 10%,
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:06.180]   maybe one out of 10 I can win.
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:07.460]   - One out of 10.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:08.820]   - Yeah.
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:12.160]   - On the topic of Goat, let me ask about Paul Morphy.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.140]   How good was he?
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:17.700]   Reddit asked me to ask you about this
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:21.160]   and why is he a tragic figure in chess?
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.040]   - Yeah, so Paul Morphy was the best player in the world
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.460]   by a bigger margin probably than anyone else
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:27.740]   in recent modern history.
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:30.640]   He was, I would say roughly using today's rating,
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.080]   he was around like 2,400 in my opinion.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.540]   And the other best players were maybe around 2000
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:37.600]   or 2,100 at best.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.340]   So he's the best player by a bigger margin.
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:43.060]   Fisher, for example, I think he was about 170-ish points,
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.880]   better than Boris Basky.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.440]   But Morphy was 300 plus at least.
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.300]   Now by modern standards,
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.440]   he would probably be a very strong IM,
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.300]   which isn't saying a whole lot,
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.340]   but at the time no one was even close.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:57.940]   So I don't think you can put him in that category
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.100]   of like best ever simply because he was not the best player
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:03.540]   for a long enough period of time.
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:05.760]   As far as why it's tragic, it's very tragic
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.100]   because he essentially quit chess.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.540]   There was no competition for him.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.000]   If you think about like Magnus talking
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.020]   about the world championship
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.140]   and feeling like it's not competitive enough,
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.460]   for Morphy there was no one
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.960]   who could even beat him probably in individual games.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.560]   So he ended up quitting chess.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.280]   I think he was sort of like a lawyer kind of,
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.320]   but he spent probably the last 15,
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:28.320]   I think last 15, 20 years of his life just doing nothing.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.400]   Now I have actually seen his grave in New Orleans.
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.320]   I have been to where he lived.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.000]   I think it's now Brennan's if I'm not mistaken
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.360]   or something like that.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.080]   So it's very tragic that there was no one
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:40.760]   who was competitive with him at the time.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.280]   As far as best ever, I don't think you can say he's the GOAT
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:47.060]   but I still think he's in the top 10
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.700]   if we're using a criteria of players
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:52.540]   who are better than their peers by a big, big margin.
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:54.940]   - So what do you think about the world championship?
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:57.540]   And what do you think about Magnus stepping down?
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:59.900]   Do you still see it as the height of chess?
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.780]   - I still think that there is merit
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.720]   in having the world championship the way it is.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.120]   At the same time, the game is always evolving.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.060]   And one of the things that has changed a lot
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:13.300]   in recent times is you now have a lot more blitz tournaments
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:15.020]   and also rapid tournaments.
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.680]   In the past, classical chess was the golden standard.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:19.300]   That was the only thing that mattered.
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:22.220]   But in the last probably 10 years, slowly but surely,
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:25.260]   there probably are as many rapid/blitz tournaments
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:27.120]   as there are classical tournaments now.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.960]   Maybe it's not quite 50/50, but at the top level at least,
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.300]   it feels like it's getting very close to 50/50.
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.140]   And in terms of the world championship,
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:38.260]   I feel that the biggest issue is you have too many draws.
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:39.540]   The games can be exciting,
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.460]   but the games inevitably end in a draw.
[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:43.860]   And the single biggest reason is because players
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.820]   have about six months or more to prepare for the match.
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:48.220]   So for example, the Canada's tournament,
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.620]   which I just played, it was in June and July.
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.300]   It ended, I think, around July 5th.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.340]   The world championship match
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.860]   will probably be in February of March.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.580]   So that's nine months.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:58.780]   And when players have that much time to prepare,
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:00.800]   they are not going to have any weaknesses
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.460]   in the opening phase of the game.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.780]   And so both players are likely going to be very solid.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:05.880]   You'll have a lot of draws.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:08.260]   And in many cases, it might come down to tie breaks.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.380]   Magnus, in fact, in two of the matches,
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.820]   both against Karjakin and against Karjuana,
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.100]   he had to win in rapid tie breaks.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:16.080]   So I think for Magnus,
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.100]   he just doesn't feel like the format is right.
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.460]   I think he feels that there's just,
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.900]   it's too long, too many draws.
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:23.900]   He doesn't get to play creative or exciting chess.
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.280]   And that's why I think he pushed so hard
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.300]   for a change in the format.
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:29.740]   I don't know what the right change would be,
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:31.420]   but I do think that the format
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:33.280]   is becoming a little bit antiquated
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.620]   with all these classical games.
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:37.020]   If you don't want to change the format,
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.700]   the one suggestion that I've mentioned before,
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:40.740]   and I think is probably still valid,
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:42.800]   is that the match should be held maybe one month
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.540]   after the Canada's tournament to determine the challenger.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.200]   It's held one month after that event.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:51.300]   That's probably the only way to keep the format as it is,
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:53.380]   where I think both players have time to prepare,
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.540]   but it's not something crazy.
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:55.940]   Because when you compare the candidates
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.780]   to other classical tournaments,
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.100]   let's just say, let's just say St. Louis.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.700]   I played there recently.
[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.380]   There was the, I played the Rapids and Blitz,
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:05.080]   but there was the Sinkfield Cup.
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:08.620]   This was, I think like September 10th, something like that.
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:10.460]   Point is, players probably came in
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.860]   and had a week or two to prepare for that tournament.
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:13.980]   Now there's the US Championship.
[01:46:13.980 --> 01:46:15.620]   Players had a little bit of time to prepare.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.440]   You play the event.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:19.020]   Normally players don't have these long breaks
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.420]   where they can prepare for very long periods of time.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.900]   So they are very well prepared,
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.540]   but you still have a lot of exciting games
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:27.060]   because that window of preparation is so much smaller.
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:29.640]   - But you had, you're pretty close,
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.380]   given how things rolled out,
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:34.880]   to having the opportunity to compete
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.820]   for the world championship.
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.340]   Hence the, the Copia meme,
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:40.180]   which I still don't quite understand.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:47.020]   Are you and Magnus friends, enemies, frenemies?
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:50.820]   What's the status of the relationship?
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:53.380]   - Yeah, I think with all the rivalries in chess,
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:55.400]   everybody tries to hype it up,
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.780]   like everyone hates each other.
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:58.580]   But the thing is, at the end of the day,
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:46:59.860]   yes, we're very competitive.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:00.820]   We want to beat each other,
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:04.260]   whether it's myself or Magnus or other, other top players.
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.440]   But we also realize that it's a very small world.
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.340]   Like a lot of us are able to make a living
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.820]   playing the game as professionals.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.900]   And as I alluded to earlier,
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:14.020]   the top 20 to 30 players can make a living.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:15.860]   So even though we're competitive against each other,
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:17.180]   we want to beat each other,
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:19.440]   there is a certain level of respect that we have.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.100]   And there is a sort of brotherhood, I would say.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:24.460]   So all of us are, I would say, frenemies.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.860]   I think that's the simplest way of putting it.
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:29.820]   - What do you love most about Magnus Carlsen
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.360]   as a human being?
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.340]   - As a human being?
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:34.700]   I think it's, it's very similar actually,
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:37.600]   to use a comparison to Tennis and Roger Federer,
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.120]   in that it feels like with Magnus,
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.740]   everything comes very easily.
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:42.520]   It's, for example, we've seen the situation
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:43.440]   with Hans Niemann.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.080]   Somehow it's rolled right off his back
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.400]   and he's playing amazing chess in his latest event.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:51.600]   So it's really how easy he seems to make it look.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.760]   And I know like, 'cause tennis is a sport
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.240]   that I've played a lot, I've followed it very closely.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.080]   I remember hearing Andy Roddick say this about Federer,
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.720]   where it's like, somehow he handles it all.
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:02.840]   Like there's no pressure, he makes it look easy.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:04.160]   And how does he do all of that?
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.820]   And I feel the same way about Magnus,
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.080]   where it seems too easy.
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.720]   'Cause I know for myself, when I'm playing these games,
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.720]   like there's stress, the pressure.
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:14.080]   And for Magnus, it just, you don't ever see that.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.540]   Now I'm sure it's probably there, but we don't witness it.
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:19.120]   So that's what I would say, is just how easy it is.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.080]   - It was sad to see Federer retire, I don't know why.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:22.920]   - Yeah.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.320]   - Just greatness.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.320]   You know, when Lionel Messi will retire,
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.520]   it would also be sad.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:29.360]   - Yeah.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.520]   - 'Cause there's certain people that are just singular.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.360]   - Right.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.880]   - In the history of a sport.
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.840]   I don't know if there's gonna be another Messi.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:40.280]   I don't know if there's gonna be another Federer.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.200]   - Yeah, not for a long time probably.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:43.920]   - Is he greatest ever, would you say?
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.240]   Is he up there?
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:46.200]   - He's definitely up there.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:48.400]   I mean, I grew up as like more of an Nadal fan,
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.920]   just because actually, I felt like Nadal,
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:51.920]   it never looked easy.
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:52.920]   It was the exact opposite.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.480]   Like for Nadal, it feels like he's always,
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.560]   he's running after every ball, he's exerting himself.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.840]   It looked really, really hard.
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.620]   And like for me, since nothing really came easily
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:04.280]   for me in chess, like I kind of, I can relate to that more.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.120]   But at the same time, like, you know,
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:07.680]   especially when Federer started losing more
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:08.920]   and he seems more human,
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.320]   I started really liking him more as well.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.840]   But I think Federer, he changed the game.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.120]   I don't know if you say he's the greatest ever,
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.560]   but the game changed forever because of him.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:19.600]   - Yeah, there's certain people,
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.980]   just last thing you'd pack, Sampras, Agassi, everybody.
[01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:27.360]   Okay, who wins in a chess boxing match
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.880]   between you and Magnus?
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:31.380]   - Probably Magnus just 'cause he's taller than me.
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.660]   I think. - Also reach?
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:34.540]   - He's taller, he has more reach, yeah.
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:36.420]   But I think he would win.
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.620]   - Question from Reddit.
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:40.020]   In what sport do you think you can beat Magnus
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.500]   10 out of 10 times?
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.140]   - I think I could beat Magnus 10 out of 10 times in tennis.
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:45.700]   I mean, I took lessons for eight years.
[01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:48.740]   I try to go out and hit two or three times every week.
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:50.620]   I think I could beat him in tennis 10 out of 10.
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:55.180]   - Backhand, forehand, what's your style of tennis play?
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.980]   - I wish I was taller 'cause I really like
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:58.020]   trying to come into the net.
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:02.300]   I like volleying a lot, but I am no Rod Laver.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.460]   Rod Laver was very short, but he was able to make it work
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:06.100]   like 50, 60 years ago.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.300]   I really like volleying, but I'm a little bit too short,
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:10.460]   so I kind of have to stay back.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:13.420]   And I mean, I normally hit, like I try to hit hard forehands
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:16.900]   and I try to slice or two-hand backhand.
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:18.820]   - You mentioned Magnus and Kariakin.
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:24.820]   And I just wonder if you have ideas, thoughts about
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:27.500]   the fact that he was originally a qualifier
[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:29.940]   to the Candidates Tournament and was disqualified
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:34.060]   by FIDE for breaching his code of ethics
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:38.700]   about related to his support for
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:40.820]   the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:47.100]   Does that ever seep into the games
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.940]   that you play over the board, the geopolitics,
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:52.380]   the actual military conflict of it all?
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.580]   Do you feel the pressure of that?
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:56.020]   Because there's battles between nations.
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:51:01.020]   NEPO's Russian, there's America,
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:05.540]   every nation is in some profound way
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:07.060]   represented on the chessboard.
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.300]   - Right, I've never really felt that.
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.940]   I think actually for me, it's very eye-opening
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:13.940]   to realize how difficult it is for a lot of
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:15.700]   the Russian chess players right now
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:17.500]   to play because of the situation,
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.940]   even NEPO for that matter.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:20.740]   I remember when we were in St. Louis,
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:23.220]   he essentially has to bring cash
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:25.180]   'cause obviously Russia's cut off from SWIFT,
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.460]   no credit cards work.
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:28.340]   So if these Russians don't have cash,
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:29.860]   they can't play and I know a lot of them
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:32.060]   have fled the country just to try and keep
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.420]   their chess career going.
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.900]   So it's a very, very tough situation for them.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:39.860]   Obviously for the Ukrainians who are suffering,
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.420]   it's really, really bad.
[01:51:41.420 --> 01:51:44.460]   - Do you know if NEPO, have you seen,
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:47.820]   has he talked about the politics,
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.580]   the geopolitics of it all?
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:51.340]   - I don't think he really has.
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:54.900]   I mean, I feel like most players try to avoid
[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:57.180]   talking about it, I think it's very difficult.
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:58.380]   I remember when I was in St. Louis,
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:00.060]   there was another Russian player, Peter Savidler,
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:02.020]   and I basically asked him, he was like,
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:04.180]   "Don't get me started because I can't,
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:06.180]   "I just can't talk about it."
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:08.620]   So I think most of them are probably
[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:09.820]   on the other side of the spectrum.
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.220]   I don't think they're probably supportive
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.580]   of what is going on right now.
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:17.100]   So it's a very, very, very difficult situation.
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:20.100]   But I don't really feel like that manifests itself
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.860]   in actual tensions when I play against
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:23.860]   the Russian players.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:26.580]   I mean, maybe when I was younger playing certain events,
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:28.860]   the one country that I felt like maybe it actually,
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.460]   I felt some tension, I really wanted to go out of my way
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:33.700]   to win against was against the Chinese, perhaps.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.420]   That is maybe the one time I felt something
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:37.220]   along those lines.
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:39.340]   But generally, I feel like we treat the players
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:42.340]   as individuals, it's not about the country they represent.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:43.460]   - Yeah.
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:47.540]   Let's go back to the philosophical of chess.
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:51.060]   What do you find most beautiful about the game of chess?
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:52.980]   Looking back over your whole career.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:56.100]   - I think looking back, it's really,
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:58.860]   it's both over the board and also just like the memories
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:52:59.780]   that I've created.
[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:03.780]   I think for me, the fact that I've been able to travel
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:05.780]   because of chess to meet so many people
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.180]   who are playing this great game
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.780]   from all different nationalities,
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:12.780]   all different backgrounds is probably the thing
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:15.420]   that I really like the most.
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:17.780]   Chess is one of the, maybe the only thing
[01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:20.220]   I can think of where you can have people,
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.380]   different backgrounds, different ages.
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:23.900]   Honestly, you can have someone who's a billionaire
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.860]   talking to someone who's like a nine-year-old kid
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:26.940]   from the inner city.
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:28.820]   And when they're talking about the game of chess,
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:30.300]   they're on the same level.
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:32.620]   And I don't think that is really applicable
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:34.380]   to anything else in this world.
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:36.180]   You don't have that level of respect
[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:37.660]   that is communicated through a game.
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:40.180]   So for me, that's probably the single most beautiful thing
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:42.900]   about sort of chess and the chess world itself
[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.420]   is that you have that.
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:46.580]   In terms of the game itself, the creativity,
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.940]   the possibility of different positions,
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.980]   learning something new even after I've played the game
[01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.940]   for 30 years, it's very inspiring to me
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.460]   knowing that I've spent all this time,
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.580]   there still are new things that I can learn.
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:54:00.100]   Those are probably two biggest, biggest things
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:01.700]   that I would refer to.
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:04.620]   - Are there memories, big or small,
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:07.460]   like weird, surprising anecdotes from all those years
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.020]   of going to all the different places that stand out to you?
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:14.340]   Some of the darker times, weirder times,
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.860]   like weird places you've played,
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:18.700]   weird people you've played, weird people you hung out with.
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.420]   Anything that jumps to memory?
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.420]   - I think this is probably a little bit more like political,
[01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:25.780]   but I think one of the things that's great
[01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:27.580]   is whenever you go and play these tournaments,
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.380]   you have a certain impression of what a country is like
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.580]   or what the people are like.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:35.340]   And probably the best example for me was in 2004,
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:37.300]   or actually, no, sorry, it was 2003, I think it was,
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.620]   I played in the FIDE World Cup and it was held in Tripoli,
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:42.020]   the capital of Libya at the time
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:43.940]   when Gaddafi was still running the country.
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:46.060]   And you hear a lot of these things,
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:47.180]   but then when you go there
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.980]   and you see the people are so friendly,
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:51.660]   it's very eye-opening and sort of you look at it
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:54.300]   without just believing things.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:56.500]   You go to these places, you see how things truly are.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.180]   And generally, I find that it's very different
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:00.060]   than how the media will portray it.
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:03.020]   One of my great regrets is as someone who loves history,
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.020]   not going to see Magnus Lepto,
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:07.020]   which were the greatest ruins,
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:09.900]   I think greatest ruins in Africa from the Roman times,
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:12.180]   and of course no longer exists.
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:14.100]   So I really do regret that.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:16.460]   I think another thing that's very unique about chess
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:19.580]   is that all of us, even when we compete as children,
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:21.100]   like there are a lot of people like Nepo and others
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:22.780]   who I've known for a very, very long time.
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:23.620]   There are a lot of people
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:25.980]   who no longer play chess competitively,
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:28.140]   but inevitably you end up talking to these people
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:29.420]   many years down the road.
[01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:31.980]   And so you never truly lose touch with the game
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:33.820]   or the people that you grew up playing it with.
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:35.540]   And there's so many of these people
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:37.740]   that I connected with in the last couple of years
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:39.220]   who I knew when I was a kid
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:40.780]   and then they went off, did something else,
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:43.860]   but you still end up talking to them
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:47.180]   and being able to share these old memories.
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:50.340]   - So you said you're a bit of a student,
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:53.740]   a fan of history, even ancient history.
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:58.340]   Are there cultures, periods of time,
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:02.540]   people from human history that you draw wisdom from
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:06.460]   about human nature that you're particularly drawn to?
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:07.300]   - A lot.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:08.860]   I mean, I probably study,
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:10.660]   mostly it'd be like ancient Roman history
[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:12.660]   or pre-Roman empire,
[01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:16.220]   and of course ancient Persia is another subject
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:18.180]   that I've studied a lot on.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:20.460]   If you ask me, I would say, I mean,
[01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:24.140]   it depends, you're talking like military generals,
[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:26.380]   you're talking like philosophers,
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:27.220]   I mean, there's everything.
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:28.300]   - So yeah, so both, right?
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:32.180]   So philosophers is how people thought about the world.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:35.300]   Of course, military has to do with
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:39.940]   how people sort of conquered lands.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:42.180]   Both are interesting because in part,
[01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:46.620]   it seems so far away from what we are today,
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:50.460]   and it's cool to see that people were kind of the same
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:53.740]   in their ability to invent amazing things,
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:56.580]   and maybe the same and different
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:58.540]   in their willingness to go to war.
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:00.460]   - So I think, I mean, one of my favorite books
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:01.900]   that I've read in the last couple of years
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:03.940]   is "The Histories" by Herodotus,
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:06.420]   I mean, basically considered the father of history.
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:09.860]   And I mean, I really love reading about these things
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:11.460]   like Thermopylae or Marathon,
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.540]   these great ancient battles.
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:15.460]   I don't know if there's like a specific like quote
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:17.860]   or wording or something like that that I can come up with,
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:19.860]   but that is one of my favorite,
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:22.340]   favorite books on history by far.
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:24.460]   - So those books were written a long time ago.
[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:27.300]   - Yeah, it's like 400, I think it was like 400 BC
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.180]   was when that was written.
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:29.820]   - So what's that like?
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:32.020]   What's that like reading that?
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.180]   - It's just--
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.300]   - Does it seem ancient?
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.900]   - It does seem ancient, like it's sort of,
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:38.980]   I feel like for myself,
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:40.420]   one of the things I really like doing
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:41.940]   is getting away from technology
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.380]   when I have the opportunity,
[01:57:43.380 --> 01:57:45.020]   trying to disconnect these sorts of things.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.500]   And so when I read books like that,
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.380]   besides just having a general interest,
[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:49.620]   it sort of reminds me like,
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:52.060]   there is really a life without all this stuff,
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:54.080]   or there was at least at some point.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:56.820]   And so it's something that I can kind of relate to.
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.980]   - Like humanity flourishes without all the stuff we take,
[01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:03.340]   we think is fundamental to our current culture.
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:06.460]   Like all that we find beautiful about humanity
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:08.580]   can still exist without any of the technology.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:10.100]   - Yes, definitely.
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:11.420]   That's a really good reminder,
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:13.860]   given the contrast, of course, is beautiful,
[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:18.020]   because you're in the midst of the technology with streaming.
[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:20.620]   Like to me, streaming somehow feels,
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:25.620]   because of how large of a percentage
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:31.460]   of young people are interested, like consumes streams,
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:35.020]   it feels to represent like the future,
[01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:38.260]   because so many people kind of develop their mind
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:41.540]   by watching Twitch and YouTube.
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:43.540]   - Right, I mean, that's definitely true.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:46.340]   For myself, I remember when I was a little bit younger,
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:48.040]   I was like 17, 18 around then,
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.340]   I would actually try one day a week on the weekend
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:53.140]   to try not to look at like my computer or my phone.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:55.540]   Now phones weren't where they are today, obviously,
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:57.380]   but I was able to do that pretty easily.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:58.400]   Now it's very hard.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.940]   Like when I try to go one day,
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:01.400]   recently I tried to do that,
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.540]   I actually just pulled some books out of my garage
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:06.420]   and I started reading, and it was a very foreign concept.
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:10.100]   So I do read a lot, but it's always on an iPad,
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:12.200]   or a Kindle, yeah, both of those actually.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:15.300]   So it's very, very weird,
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:19.360]   but I do try when I can to get away from it all.
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:20.780]   I mean, another thing, like I said,
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.260]   I really like going out into nature
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:23.300]   when I have the opportunity.
[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:25.740]   I've spent a lot of time in Colorado, for example,
[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:27.980]   hiking some of the 14ers,
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:30.060]   that is one of those life goals that I have
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:33.180]   to go and get to the top of every single one of them.
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:34.760]   So I try to disconnect when I can,
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:37.020]   but of course it's very hard.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:40.580]   - So whether it's disconnecting or not,
[01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:42.180]   can you take me through a perfect day
[01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:44.260]   in the life of Fikar and Nakamura
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.180]   on a day of a big chess match?
[01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:49.660]   Well, actually, multiple days, right?
[01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:51.560]   We'll take one where it's a big chess match
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:55.620]   and one that's just like your representative average day.
[01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:58.660]   - A perfect chess day, although I cannot do this,
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:00.180]   it would start the night before,
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.220]   I would get nine hours of sleep,
[02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:03.560]   like a consistent nine hours,
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:05.960]   like say 12 a.m. to 9 a.m., for example,
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:08.160]   let's just say the round starts at like two o'clock
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:11.420]   and then nine to say 12 o'clock, I do preparation,
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:13.440]   and then 12 to one, I go eat lunch,
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.440]   and at one to two, I just nap or I walk
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:17.280]   or I do something completely unrelated to it.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:19.180]   That would be the perfect day.
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:22.640]   - When are you doing everything except the preparation,
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:23.840]   are you thinking about chess at all
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:24.920]   or are you trying not to think about chess?
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:27.000]   - Trying not to think about chess, definitely not.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:27.840]   - And what do you do?
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:29.080]   Is there any tricks to that?
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:31.440]   - Well, I find that like if I go outside,
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.200]   I just try to hear like the birds or I try to listen,
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:36.040]   it's one of those like meditation kind of things,
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.640]   like they always say when you meditate,
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:39.480]   you try to hear yourself breathing.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.760]   It's like when you close your eyes,
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:43.220]   try to hear yourself breathing, just focus on that.
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:45.340]   So I do try to do things like that
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:46.920]   from time to time as well.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.800]   - So in terms of getting nine hours of sleep,
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:50.840]   does that come difficult to you?
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.200]   - That almost never happens.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.120]   I mean, there've been a couple times where it has happened,
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:55.560]   like in Norway specifically,
[02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:58.840]   but generally, I don't sleep well during chess terms,
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.720]   I wish I did, but.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.920]   - So we're talking about a perfect day,
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.360]   so sleep is really important.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.520]   What about diet and stuff like that?
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.680]   - Yeah, I think for a lot of people,
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.560]   they try to keep it light before the round,
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.560]   actually like I remember hearing this story
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:14.440]   from Peter Savidler some years back, a Russian GM,
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.440]   and he said that Kasparov would go and eat like a big steak
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:19.760]   right before the game and he would be completely fine,
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:22.440]   but I think for most players, it's the exact opposite.
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:24.200]   You try to like eat like some snacks,
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:26.600]   like maybe some nuts, a few bars, things of this nature,
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:28.000]   or maybe just like maybe fish,
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.880]   something very light for lunch before the game,
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.760]   and then you probably eat a lot after the game.
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:34.960]   That's generally what you try to do,
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:37.520]   but I don't think there's any like specific diet
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:38.880]   that makes a huge difference,
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.600]   but everyone is different, of course.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:42.480]   - So when you're actually at the board
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.560]   on that perfect day, how do you maintain focus
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:49.600]   for so many hours of classical chess?
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:53.560]   Like, you know what, like minute to minute,
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:56.800]   second to second, how are you able to maintain focus?
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:57.800]   Is there tricks to that?
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.360]   How difficult is that?
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.480]   - I think it really depends on the type of the game
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:03.320]   that you're playing.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.240]   I think if it's a game that's very, very calm
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.160]   and very slow where not a lot happens at the start,
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:11.440]   it's a lot easier because you're not having
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.440]   to be super focused.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.200]   Like your mind can drift and whatnot,
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.680]   and then at the critical moment, you have to sort of zone in.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:17.880]   So those are the easiest ones.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:20.840]   I think generally when games are very complicated
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.600]   from the start, what you're doing is you're just,
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:27.480]   you're trying to not let your mind wander at all,
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:29.280]   because when games are complicated like that,
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:31.200]   one of the things that I've never been very good at
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.880]   is my mind does wander, and you're always,
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.720]   like I'm always worrying about the next move.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:35.880]   It's like, is this a blunder?
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:36.880]   What's going on?
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:39.280]   Like, what am I gonna do?
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:42.680]   So you're trying, I think, very much to block out the noise.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:44.680]   I think that's actually the hardest thing,
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:46.560]   is also because like, I can say this,
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:48.640]   when I played Magnus before, there have been times
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:50.680]   when I've gotten winning positions against him.
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:52.440]   And in that moment when I had the winning position,
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.440]   very oftentimes my mind wanders, like, okay,
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.320]   you're about to win this game, and you're like, okay,
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:57.280]   what happens after the game?
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.800]   You win this game, gain the rating points,
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:02:59.920]   all these different things,
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:02.280]   but you haven't actually won the game yet.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.200]   And I think for a lot of players, that's the hardest thing,
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:06.720]   is when you get a winning position, your mind does drift.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:10.800]   It drifts to like, what happens after you've won the game,
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:11.840]   or what the outcome is.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.840]   - So drifting into the future,
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:14.960]   and you should stay in the moment.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:17.040]   You really should hold on.
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.360]   And also, what is it?
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.080]   Yeah, probably getting excited about the win.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.040]   What is it about that that makes you worse at playing?
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:30.200]   So interesting, like getting--
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:32.920]   - I think it's like, it's nervous,
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.320]   but it's like you're too excited, I think.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:36.800]   It's like you're waiting for it to end,
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:38.200]   you expect it to end.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.520]   And then your opponent keeps defending,
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.560]   and you can make mistakes.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:43.920]   - What about the flip side of that,
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.800]   where you start getting frustrated?
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:49.240]   Like, how do you try to recover from that kind of thing?
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:50.680]   - It's very difficult.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.280]   I think for myself, I just try to basically focus on it
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:56.840]   every single move.
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.440]   Again, you try to block out the noise,
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.560]   no matter which direction it's going in.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.120]   So I try as best I can.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.880]   I mean, sometimes I'm very poor at it.
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:05.880]   Like, I just don't do a good job
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:06.760]   blocking out the noise at all.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.160]   But I think generally, I try to think,
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:09.480]   okay, just make this next move.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.880]   Make your opponent have to find the best moves.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:14.080]   And just keep the game going, no matter what.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:15.080]   Just keep it going.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:18.520]   - By the way, what's a long day of classical chess?
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:19.680]   What's that look like?
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:20.760]   - It's pretty brutal.
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.040]   I mean, it would be something like,
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:23.720]   okay, so the game starts at two o'clock.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.960]   So you've done all this other stuff.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:27.520]   The game probably goes from like two to seven, for example,
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.960]   or maybe two to eight, five, six hours.
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:32.560]   Probably you eat dinner for an hour or so,
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:35.360]   maybe clear, like I'll go clear my head for 30 minutes.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.080]   And then immediately it's right back to studying
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.480]   for a couple of hours.
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:40.800]   - Are you reviewing previous games, or you're already?
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.880]   - Generally, you're just moving on to the next game.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:43.720]   That's what you're doing.
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:46.040]   - And trying to, no matter what happened,
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:47.280]   put that behind you.
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.960]   Win or lose or draw.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:53.120]   - Okay, so that's also why there's another question
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:53.960]   a lot of people wonder,
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.080]   which is why don't I play more of these classical tournaments
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:59.080]   and sort of, it gets back to the, you know,
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.720]   the literally don't care sort of stuff.
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:02.600]   But when I'm going to play in tournaments,
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:05.200]   I want to be able to give it my best shot.
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.600]   And if I don't feel that I can, I'm not going to play,
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:11.000]   which is why, like I play here and there,
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.480]   but I do balance my schedule very carefully
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:15.160]   because I'm not just going to go and play a tournament
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:18.520]   simply because if I don't feel that I can put in the work,
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.800]   it's not the right thing to do.
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:23.480]   Also because I'm taking away a spot from somebody else
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:25.320]   who probably will be putting in the work,
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:26.880]   who will want to compete in that event.
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.880]   And so when I look at the candidates,
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:30.840]   or a lot of people said, "Well, why is he playing?"
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:31.920]   They're like, "Okay, he qualified,
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.040]   "but he's not going to take it seriously."
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:36.960]   But I did give it everything I had in that tournament.
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:39.720]   And I always will as much as I can.
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:42.920]   If I can't do that, then I'm just not going to play.
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:47.040]   - So what about a perfect day in the life of Fakaro
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.320]   when you're not doing anything?
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.360]   - Oh, a perfect day.
[02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:51.960]   A perfect day would be something along the lines of,
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:54.440]   I get up very early at like three, four o'clock
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:57.600]   in the morning, drive an hour away, and go climb mountains.
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.440]   That's the perfect day.
[02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:00.000]   Out into the mountains.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.960]   Oh, do you mean a normal non?
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:04.000]   - Yeah, a perfectly productive normal day.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:04.960]   - Oh, perfectly productive.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:07.160]   Okay, so perfectly productive would be along the lines
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:10.160]   of I wake up at like 7.30, eight o'clock.
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.640]   Probably I watch either Bloomberg or CNBC
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:15.040]   for 30 minutes to an hour.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:17.320]   And then watch the markets for maybe an hour or two,
[02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:18.680]   look at certain things that are going on.
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.240]   - So you really care about investing?
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:21.680]   - I do follow it quite closely.
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:23.360]   Yeah, I follow the markets very closely.
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.120]   Closer than I should, but yes.
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:28.080]   - For personal reasons, or do you comment on it?
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:30.960]   Like for personal investing reasons
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:33.680]   or for like philosophical understanding
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.120]   what's going on in the world?
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.640]   - It's sort of everything.
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:39.560]   I think, first of all, obviously I'm interested in investing.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.320]   I have been for many, many years.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:45.000]   I've done investing trading for at least a decade now.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.760]   So like I am very interested on that level.
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:48.480]   I'm also quite interested as well
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:50.760]   because when you see the policy that's being dictated,
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:53.400]   like you look in the last six months specifically,
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:56.160]   you see the Fed policy around things like interest rates,
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:58.440]   unemployment, things of this nature.
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.160]   It is something that interests me also
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.840]   'cause I do invest in real estate
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:03.520]   aside from the stock market.
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:05.400]   So therefore I'm always keeping an eye
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:07.720]   on these sorts of things and always looking.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:11.440]   And as a better example, like I'm looking for trends.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.320]   So if we go back to, I think it was 20,
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:15.160]   I could have the year wrong.
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:18.560]   2015 or 2016, there was a pattern that I found
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:21.800]   that on the Fed minutes that came out,
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.520]   I believe two to 15, I think it's on the Wednesday
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:27.280]   of every, well, third Wednesday of every month,
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:30.040]   that gold would actually, the gold ETFs and ETNs
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:34.440]   would actually go up every single Wednesday of the month
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.680]   that the minutes came out.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:37.440]   So I would follow things like that.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.560]   Now, of course I wasn't like trading huge volume,
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.720]   but I found a trend there.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.840]   Of course it stopped working at a certain point,
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:44.000]   but those are the sorts of things that,
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:44.840]   they just interest me.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:47.200]   Even if it's not something that I'm doing to make a living,
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.400]   trying to spot those trends,
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:51.320]   it's always been something that has fascinated me.
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:55.720]   - One Reddit said that you shorted Tesla some time ago.
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:58.680]   Do you regret doing so?
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.320]   - Well, when I did those plays,
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:02.240]   that was small amounts of money,
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:04.320]   and that was only via puts.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:07.280]   That was where I would buy puts or put spreads on it.
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.080]   So it wasn't something where I was straight shorting.
[02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:11.640]   I would never actually do that
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:13.840]   because it's just, it's not worth the risk.
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:16.080]   And I don't want to ever be in a situation
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:18.280]   where I have to think about those sorts of things.
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:20.320]   And I think a better example is,
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.920]   there was a period in 2016,
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:23.520]   actually shortly before the candidates,
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.240]   when I actually was in oil.
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:26.800]   I had a long position in oil.
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:29.560]   And this is when oil completely crashed.
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:32.480]   It went very, I don't think it went below,
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:33.680]   did it go below 30 even?
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:34.560]   It went very low.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.880]   And of course the Saudis were not cutting,
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:40.440]   they were not, I think they were,
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:42.080]   were they cutting or not cutting production?
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:44.160]   But anyway, there was a period in 2016
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:47.240]   where I had a big long position in one of the 3X oil ETFs.
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.240]   And it kept going down day after day after day.
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.840]   And then of course, right near the bottom,
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:53.080]   I finally couldn't take it anymore.
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.120]   I took a loss.
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:56.640]   And that really sort of,
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:58.280]   it was very difficult dealing with that,
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:01.040]   the stress, everyday looking, seeing those losses.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.120]   And after that, I kind of decided
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:05.720]   I would never put myself in such a situation again.
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:09.840]   And so that's why I don't do shorting.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:10.680]   And then separately,
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:13.080]   and I think I posted a reply to this comment,
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:15.520]   but in 2021, as Tesla started going up,
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.200]   I actually started selling puts.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:18.760]   And I did quite well off of that.
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:21.160]   So it's sort of play both sides,
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:24.560]   never become hard set with your conviction.
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:25.960]   Like where you refuse,
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:29.000]   like this is just like, it has to go down
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.760]   or like it has to go up.
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.400]   Just you have to be willing to adapt.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:37.720]   - Do you think shorting should be legal?
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:39.000]   Do you think it's ethical?
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.800]   Like to me, I don't know much about investing,
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:44.920]   but I feel like it feels wrong.
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.920]   Now I know if something is overinflated,
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:53.160]   it's good for there to be an opposing force
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:55.600]   to like balance it or something like that.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:59.680]   But it just feels like in our current modern internet world,
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:02.440]   I think Tesla, I vaguely saw somewhere
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:05.960]   that's like the most shorted stock like ever.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:10.960]   And so that incentivizes a lot of the publication
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:13.120]   of misinformation about it.
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:16.760]   Like it just feels like the incentives are wrong.
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.040]   Not when we look at the markets,
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.640]   but at the future of human civilization perspective,
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:25.040]   it just feels like shorting is somehow wrong.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:26.800]   But maybe I'm misunderstanding
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:28.080]   the broader picture of markets.
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:30.400]   - Well, I actually try not to do that.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.160]   Like I almost only take long positions specifically
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:37.480]   'cause I feel like you're betting like on world collapsing.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:40.440]   I just, I feel like morally, I don't wanna be in that.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:42.400]   That I don't wanna have that viewpoint.
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.960]   I think, you know, that sort of is another thing
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:45.800]   that I've noticed.
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:47.000]   Like I've been very lucky.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:47.840]   I've traveled a lot.
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:49.640]   I've met a lot of famous people.
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:50.960]   And the one thing that I've noticed is like
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:53.500]   a lot of the people who are the most successful,
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:55.080]   they're the ones who are very optimistic.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.600]   No matter what is happening day to day,
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:58.400]   they remain very optimistic
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:01.280]   about the future of where things are going.
[02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:03.560]   So I try not to end up in that situation.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:05.480]   I think as far as like shorting specifically,
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:09.320]   the real danger to me is that anybody can now invest.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.840]   And I feel like actually some of these apps like Robinhood,
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:13.840]   they go out of their way to try and make it seem
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:15.760]   like it's this fun game.
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:18.120]   Like I've seen people where you place a trade
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:20.280]   and it like, it gives you like these stickers
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.040]   or these pop-ups like of confetti.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:25.040]   And it's like, wait a second, what's going on here
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.420]   with the whole game?
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:27.520]   Like people are sort of,
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.020]   they're going after the wrong thing.
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:32.920]   So I don't think shorting like will be banned,
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:35.400]   but I think it's very dangerous that everybody has access
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:38.000]   to being able to do things like that.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.540]   - So according to Reddit on the topic of Tesla,
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:44.420]   you have trouble admitting when you make a mistake.
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:45.300]   Is that true?
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:48.360]   - No, that's generally not true.
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.440]   Actually, I think that-
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.120]   - Wait, Reddit is not 100% accurate and truthful
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.080]   in its representation of a character?
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:57.040]   That's fascinating.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:00.220]   - No, I think the thing that I've learned is
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:02.420]   I'm obviously very good at chess,
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:05.020]   but that doesn't automatically mean that I'm a genius
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:05.860]   in everything else.
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:07.860]   And I feel like that's another thing actually
[02:12:07.860 --> 02:12:09.980]   that I really, really admire about Magnus
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.180]   is that he is the world champion, he's the best player,
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:13.980]   but he does not automatically believe
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:17.100]   that that translates to every area of life.
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:19.380]   I feel like with some other world champions,
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:22.180]   they think that they're great no matter what they do.
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:25.300]   And that's not like intentionally trying to be like rude,
[02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:27.320]   I do feel like there's certain people who feel like that.
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:30.800]   Like anything they say is right and they are the authority.
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:32.860]   When in reality, we are the authorities
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:34.960]   when it comes to chess, we know chess the best,
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:37.480]   we are the experts, but that doesn't automatically mean
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.040]   we're geniuses in everything else.
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:41.240]   - That said, I think you said somewhere,
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:44.400]   could have been on the C Squared podcast,
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:49.200]   that I forget if it's chess or streaming
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:52.640]   that taught you to generalize to various,
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.340]   you feel like you're able to do other things now.
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:56.700]   Was that streaming?
[02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:59.020]   - I don't know if that's specifically streaming,
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:01.380]   but I think streaming has taught me a lot
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:05.740]   about sort of life and also how to run a business honestly.
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:07.880]   Like I have read a lot of business books
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:10.260]   and one of the things with streaming
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:12.660]   is that when you start out, it's like this very small thing.
[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:14.340]   It's just you, maybe you have a couple of people
[02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:15.680]   who help you along the way,
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:17.940]   but as it becomes bigger and bigger, if there's a boom,
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:19.840]   you suddenly start having to hire employees,
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:21.500]   you're basically running this business.
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:24.740]   And like for me, I've learned a lot about that
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:27.940]   because there was this book that I read some years back,
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:30.460]   I think it was by Mary Buffett, it was on Warren Buffett
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:33.100]   and how he tries to be hands-off,
[02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:34.940]   like when he buys these companies, it's hands-off,
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.980]   management stays the same, you don't do anything.
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:39.620]   And I actually, I try to do things kind of the same way
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:41.420]   where like I try to be hands-off,
[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:42.480]   there are a couple of people around me,
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:45.480]   I leave a lot of the general day-to-day decisions up to them
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:47.140]   and then like things that are really important,
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:49.700]   obviously I'm involved in, but I try to do things like that.
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:53.500]   So streaming is, you learn a lot along the way.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:54.980]   And I think now having done that,
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:57.980]   there probably are several other potential careers
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:13:59.940]   that I could have if I really wanted to.
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:02.980]   - Almost about that generalizing terms
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:05.600]   is what it takes to build a business from the ground up.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:09.300]   From the process of becoming a successful streamer,
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:12.180]   you have learned what it takes to start from the ground up
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:14.420]   with a single person and to build a business
[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:16.860]   as multiple people and as successful.
[02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:20.420]   What do you attribute your success as a streamer to?
[02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:22.500]   - I mean, many things.
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:24.820]   I think being a very strong chess player
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:26.140]   and having had a following
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:28.540]   was incredibly important at the start.
[02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:31.900]   I think anybody, whether it's chess or whatever field,
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:34.860]   if you have that following to begin with from your career
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:37.100]   or whatever activity or video game you do,
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:39.700]   that's already a big step up if you have that to begin with.
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:41.620]   So that definitely played a big role.
[02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:44.620]   I think more than that though, for me, it's about the fans.
[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:47.660]   It's about hearing from people how they feel.
[02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:49.000]   I mean, there are trolls obviously,
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.740]   but the positive messages you hear
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:53.940]   when you hear about people who are struggling in life,
[02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:56.900]   whether it's say, I've heard people talk about having cancer
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:58.660]   or you hear about someone going through a divorce
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:00.900]   or they're just trying to make it through day to day.
[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:02.660]   When you hear about things like that,
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:05.140]   I think it really puts it all into perspective
[02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:07.380]   about what it all means at the end of the day.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:10.400]   And so for me, it really is the fans
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:12.340]   that they give me that motivation.
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:14.300]   They are the reason I do it.
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:16.580]   And when I meet some of these fans in person,
[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:19.180]   like I have at a couple of events,
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:21.360]   like just talking to them, hearing their story,
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.740]   just knowing that I can bring them some joy is,
[02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:27.100]   again, at the end of the day, it's why are you doing it?
[02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:28.140]   That's what it's about.
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:30.060]   If I can bring people joy,
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:32.580]   if it's someone working in a factory all day,
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:33.500]   someone in the middle of the country,
[02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:36.820]   if I bring them joy through my chess, that means a lot.
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:37.980]   If it's a kid, for example,
[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:40.780]   if I can inspire them to take up chess in a more serious way
[02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:42.640]   or even honestly, if they just learn
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:44.440]   from chess certain skills like critical thinking
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:46.840]   and that leads to them becoming like a great scientist
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:48.020]   or something down the road,
[02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:51.280]   that is what I'm ultimately hoping.
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:52.760]   That's what I hope will come out of it.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:55.680]   - I mean, what gave you strength to have to turn on,
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.260]   I mean, I don't know how much you stream, but it's a lot.
[02:15:58.260 --> 02:15:59.760]   So day after day after day,
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:02.120]   to be able to put that content out there,
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:05.880]   is there some, can you comment on the challenge of that
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:07.440]   and maybe the low points,
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:09.360]   how you're able to overcome that?
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.760]   - I actually don't feel the lows.
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:13.920]   And I think the main reason I don't feel the lows
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:16.480]   is because at the end of the day, I've been very fortunate,
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.960]   even as a chess player, very, very fortunate,
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:22.400]   travel the world, meet people, I've lived a great life.
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:26.400]   So for me to see myself as a streamer doing so well
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:28.160]   and bringing joy to people,
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:29.620]   I don't feel like I'm in a position,
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:30.720]   maybe this is wrong to say this
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:32.360]   'cause mental health is very important,
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:35.120]   but for myself, I feel like I'm very lucky.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.540]   I don't really have any right to complain.
[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:40.400]   So I don't really feel those lows in the same way.
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:42.320]   There are times when there are certain things like Reddit
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:45.360]   or otherwise that will get on my nerves a little bit,
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:48.200]   but I'm able to realize that I'm so fortunate.
[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:52.760]   And so I don't generally struggle with the lows that much.
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:55.140]   - Speaking of Reddit and trolls,
[02:16:55.140 --> 02:17:00.140]   Reddit asked me to ask you to tell me the story of Chess Bay,
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:04.560]   the Reddit moderator who pitted you against Eric Hansen,
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:07.000]   also known as Chess Bro.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.960]   I'm just saying things I don't know.
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:10.240]   I don't know much about Eric Hansen.
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:12.400]   I guess Eric is another grandmaster.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:17.400]   You guys had some drama and tension between each other.
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:22.360]   So I will also ask you to tell me what you like best
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:24.280]   about Eric Hansen as a human being.
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:25.120]   - Here's what I would say.
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:28.880]   The whole streamers and the whole boom of chess,
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:30.880]   there are certain people, certain entities
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:33.960]   that are very, very important to what happened.
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:35.400]   There are a lot of people in the right place
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:37.280]   at the right time, myself, Botez,
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:39.440]   the Chess Bros, Levy as well.
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:41.280]   We were all kind of in the right place at the right time.
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:43.840]   But just having the personalities alone is not enough.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:45.320]   You need people who push things.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.160]   And there are a lot of things that have been said
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.120]   about Chess Bay, about what she did.
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:50.960]   At the end of the day,
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:52.820]   the way that I view it is pretty straightforward.
[02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:54.720]   You don't have to agree with what she did,
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:56.200]   the manner in which she did things,
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:00.660]   but it pushed the directory and Chess on Twitch forward
[02:18:00.660 --> 02:18:02.500]   in a way that would not have been possible
[02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:04.200]   with anybody else at the time.
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:08.600]   Chess.com, for example, they were not directly pushing it.
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:10.480]   So you needed someone who was pushing it.
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:13.160]   And that, so to me, when I look at the whole boom actually
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:14.560]   of what happened on Twitch,
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:17.360]   in many ways I think she's just as responsible as I was,
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:19.640]   Levy was, Botez was, and the Bros were.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.320]   All of us were extremely fortunate
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:23.520]   'cause if you didn't have someone pushing it forward
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:26.400]   and Chess.com was not really that involved at the time,
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:28.140]   it never would have gotten to where it was.
[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:30.360]   So you can sort of look at it and say,
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.300]   okay, you don't agree with what happened,
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:33.560]   but you needed someone like that
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.920]   who was gonna push, push really hard
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:37.620]   to get chess to where it is today.
[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:40.340]   - Can you comment on what happened for people
[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:42.060]   who have no clue what you were talking about?
[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:43.020]   Is that not useful?
[02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:45.820]   - I don't think it's specifically useful to get into it.
[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:47.740]   I think there are a lot of layers.
[02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:49.500]   People felt there were things like abuses of power,
[02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:50.340]   things of that nature.
[02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:52.620]   There were a lot of things that were said.
[02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:54.340]   You know, I don't wanna be super negative
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:56.920]   about what happened specifically,
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:59.140]   but one thing people will note
[02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:01.940]   is that prior to what did happen in April of 20,
[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:03.940]   I think that was 2021 now,
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:05.340]   there were a lot more collaborations.
[02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:07.660]   The chess world was much more together as a whole.
[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:09.620]   A lot of streamers did things together.
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:10.940]   After what happened in April,
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:12.780]   there was a big sort of separation.
[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:15.480]   A lot of streamers went off in their own directions
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.480]   because of what happened.
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:19.700]   So that is, I mean, that's not the whole story.
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:21.480]   There's a lot more to it, of course,
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:23.180]   but I think it's fair to say that.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:26.180]   - If I can just comment on the few times
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:28.260]   I've tuned into the streaming world,
[02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:31.100]   I do hate to see the silos that were created.
[02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:32.800]   One of the reasons I've been a fan
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:35.740]   and now a good friend of Joe Rogan,
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:36.980]   you call it collaborations,
[02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:39.420]   but it's basically everybody's supporting each other,
[02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:41.820]   gets excited for each other, promotes each other,
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:43.860]   and there's not that competitive feeling.
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:46.900]   With streamers, sometimes I've just noticed
[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:51.900]   that there's a natural siloing effect.
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:54.820]   I don't know why that is exactly.
[02:19:54.820 --> 02:19:58.900]   Maybe because drama is somehow good
[02:19:58.900 --> 02:20:01.580]   for views and clicks and that kind of stuff.
[02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:02.440]   I don't know what that is,
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:03.780]   but I hate to see it
[02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:08.780]   'cause I love seeing friendship and collaboration.
[02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:11.460]   - I think this also goes,
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:13.020]   again, try not to be super negative,
[02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:15.380]   but this also goes to the chess world as a whole.
[02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:17.260]   One of the things that I've been in this chess world
[02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:19.280]   for a very long time, not talking about online,
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:20.580]   but just the chess world itself,
[02:20:20.580 --> 02:20:22.260]   and I've been very fortunate
[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:24.820]   'cause I've seen a couple of booms and busts.
[02:20:24.820 --> 02:20:27.340]   It actually wasn't late '90s, it was in the mid '90s.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:30.420]   There was a period of time when Intel and IBM
[02:20:30.420 --> 02:20:33.200]   and all these tech companies were very big on chess.
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:35.800]   There was this PCA Grand Prix World Championship
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:36.940]   held in New York.
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:41.040]   I think there was the Deep Blue stuff later on
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:43.720]   in the late '90s with Garry Kasparov,
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:45.400]   and you had a lot of interest at the time,
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:47.560]   and then it sort of went up in flames
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:49.140]   for a couple different reasons.
[02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:52.720]   Also in the late 2000s or maybe mid 2000s,
[02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:55.760]   there was a group in Seattle that was very big on chess.
[02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:57.640]   They hosted the US Championship, all these different things.
[02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:00.200]   There have been a lot of booms and busts.
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:01.260]   Of course, if you go way back,
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:03.520]   there was the Fisher boom as well,
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:05.440]   but inevitably what leads to these busts?
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:07.500]   And the thing that leads to it is at the end of the day,
[02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:10.440]   people in the chess world have this natural tendency
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:12.200]   to want to not work together.
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:15.480]   You wanna hang on to whatever piece
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:16.620]   of the chess world you have,
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:19.040]   as opposed to thinking about it from the standpoint
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:21.360]   of what's good for one is good for all.
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:22.820]   And so it's one of those things
[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:24.280]   that now that I'm in this situation,
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:25.540]   having seen these booms and busts,
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:27.260]   I remember when I was younger,
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:28.480]   I would very oftentimes think,
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:29.880]   why is it that chess isn't bigger?
[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:32.800]   Why do we struggle so much to grow the game?
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.720]   And I think we see the reason.
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:36.680]   So now when I'm in this position,
[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:39.080]   it's also very tough 'cause I know what's happened.
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:41.100]   You try to learn from the past,
[02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:44.520]   but it still feels very hard to break out from that.
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:45.400]   It feels very tough.
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:48.500]   And it's also difficult because another thing
[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.400]   that people kind of misunderstand is from time to time,
[02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:52.480]   I'll talk about myself.
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:54.460]   I'll actually talk about Levy and incomes
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:55.980]   or how well we're doing.
[02:21:55.980 --> 02:21:58.000]   And the main reason I talk about this
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.120]   is that I want it to inspire like FIDE,
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:01.560]   the governing bodies and others for like,
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.680]   wow, these people, they're having such success.
[02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.680]   Like we surely we can do something different.
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:06.880]   We can change things.
[02:22:06.880 --> 02:22:08.960]   And somehow it has not happened,
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:11.320]   which is in a way very, very disheartening to me
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:13.720]   'cause I wanna see more interest in chess.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:15.200]   So you wanna see more sponsors,
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:17.920]   more of the general public getting excited by the game.
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:20.400]   So it is one of those things that's very, very difficult.
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.760]   - Yeah, so you wanna see innovation
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:25.040]   on the parts of everybody,
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:28.560]   but also the organizations like FIDE and chess.com
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:31.680]   to how to inspire a large number of people,
[02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:34.040]   which is what, this is what streamers are doing.
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:35.680]   They're constantly innovating, I guess,
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:38.920]   of how to reach a very large audience.
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:41.240]   Before we forget, just to put a little love out there.
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:42.320]   - Oh, you want me to ask about Eric?
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:43.160]   I was gonna ask Eric. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:44.400]   A little love out there.
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:48.360]   What do you like best about Eric Hansen as a human being?
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.640]   - I think it's mainly, he's just,
[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:52.520]   he's very charismatic.
[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:53.640]   He's very charismatic.
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.040]   He knows the brand that he has,
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:59.000]   and he doesn't pretend to fake it.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.120]   He knows what his brand is, and he owns it.
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:03.200]   - So he's, just for people who don't know,
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:05.240]   and I don't know, he's a grandmaster.
[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:06.080]   - He's very strong. - Chess grandmaster.
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.520]   - Yeah, he's a strong grandmaster.
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:09.840]   - But he's also a creator.
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:12.160]   - Yeah, one of the earliest major
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.840]   chess content creators on Twitch.
[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:16.040]   - Like educational stuff too?
[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:18.520]   - A mix, mix of educational, mix of high level.
[02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:19.720]   - Entertainment, okay. - A mix of everything, yeah.
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:20.680]   - Okay, awesome.
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.040]   What historical chess figure do you think
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:26.240]   would have the best dreams?
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:30.400]   - Historical chess figure, I would say probably Mikhail Tal.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:32.400]   He was a former world champion.
[02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:37.400]   Now he lived a very, very exciting life, let's put it that.
[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:39.320]   He was somebody who drank.
[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.200]   He's from Latvia.
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:44.200]   He's called the magician from Riga.
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:45.760]   So he drank a lot.
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.920]   He smoked a lot.
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:49.240]   A lot of other stuff as well.
[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:51.600]   - Oh, like sex, drugs, and rock and roll?
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:52.800]   - Kind of, yeah.
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:55.200]   I think if you look at, actually,
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:56.960]   not even just top grandmasters,
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:23:58.840]   or not even world champions, but top grandmasters,
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:03.840]   he probably had the most interesting life by far, by far.
[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:07.200]   And even as an example of how much he loved chess
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:09.600]   and what a character he was,
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:12.680]   I think when he was dying in 19,
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:14.720]   I think it was 1989 or maybe it was '91,
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:16.800]   when he was dying, he actually left the hospital
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:18.720]   to go play a Blitz tournament in Moscow,
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:20.200]   and he actually beat Garry Kasparov
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:22.560]   in that Blitz tournament in one of the games.
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:23.960]   - At what age?
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:26.520]   - Probably like late 50s, mid 50s, late 50s.
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:28.280]   I mean, he drank too much, so he died young.
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:31.280]   But yeah, he left the hospital in Moscow
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:34.000]   and went to play a Blitz tournament, he beat Kasparov.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.600]   - Well, first of all, just to push back,
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:38.800]   I think we all die too young,
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:41.720]   and some of the most impactful people,
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.600]   like Churchill, did quite a bit of drinking and smoking,
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:46.440]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:49.240]   So you can still do brilliant things,
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.560]   even if you partake in the old,
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:54.920]   whisking, drugs, and rock and roll, and women.
[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:57.600]   - Okay, just about streaming though,
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:01.040]   there's this quote that I love,
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:02.320]   which is the Steve Jobs quote,
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:05.880]   which is you can never connect the dots looking forward,
[02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:07.520]   you can only connect them looking backwards.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:10.720]   And when I look at how I got into streaming,
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:13.120]   there were all these things that happened along the way
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:14.520]   that were so beneficial.
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:17.360]   So first thing would be that when I was young
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:19.720]   and I was growing up, I played a lot of Blitz chess
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:20.920]   on the Internet Chess Club,
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:23.640]   it was one of the predecessors to chess.com.
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:27.280]   And there was no cameras or audio or these things,
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.240]   but one thing that people did was you could commit,
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:31.200]   so you would write comments about your games
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:32.080]   and things of this nature.
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:35.080]   And so I was doing something very similar,
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:37.840]   where instead of talking, I was writing and chatting
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:39.720]   during some of the games that I was playing.
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:40.840]   So that was something that I was doing
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:42.320]   that was very, very beneficial.
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:44.500]   Without that, I don't think that I would have been able
[02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:46.240]   to have the success that I've had streaming.
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:48.800]   I think it would have taken much longer to get used to it
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:49.900]   and feel comfortable with it,
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:52.560]   but I already had that built-in advantage.
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:54.840]   Additionally, when I was younger, up until,
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:58.000]   I think I was 10 or 11, I don't remember exactly,
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.300]   I did not actually have a TV.
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:00.880]   Well, I had a TV, but I didn't have cable.
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.520]   So I did not watch TV growing up.
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:04.560]   So I listened to the radio a lot.
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.020]   I listened to a lot of baseball games
[02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:07.920]   in New York Yankees specifically.
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:09.920]   And so I think by listening to those games,
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:12.360]   like I sort of, I've heard a lot of announcers,
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:14.200]   and I think that's also, it's one of those things
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:16.080]   where you learn from what you see, kind of,
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:18.320]   when you're growing up, their examples.
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:20.720]   And so I think that was very, very beneficial.
[02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:23.760]   And then a third thing, in terms of having some flair,
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:25.680]   is when I was growing up and I was homeschooled,
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.680]   probably about 14, 15, there was this great courses.
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.720]   I think they still do some of these great courses.
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:34.400]   And there was this, I don't remember who the guy was,
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:35.520]   but he was a professor.
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:37.680]   And so I watched some of these DVDs of his lectures.
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:39.560]   And he would always dress up as someone,
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:40.960]   it was like middle ages.
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:43.220]   So he would dress up and he was sort of like an orator,
[02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:45.120]   and he would explain what happened
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:47.360]   in the 13, 14 hundreds in this sort of style.
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.240]   And that's also something that, obviously,
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:51.760]   it's not something that I can consciously internalize,
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:52.960]   but I think it's something as well,
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:55.200]   that from having watched those courses
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:57.360]   and seeing that style of oration
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:00.080]   really helped me a lot as a streamer too.
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:00.920]   - Yeah.
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:01.920]   (laughs)
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:05.120]   Yeah, all those little experiences contribute to life.
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:06.880]   That's definitely something I think about,
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:09.480]   'cause I took a pretty nonlinear path through life.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:14.080]   And I think they somehow get integrated into the picture.
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.080]   But I do connect to your idea
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:22.400]   that you being good at chess was a part,
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.520]   was an important part of your success in streaming.
[02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:29.960]   I think that's really good advice for people to be good,
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:35.600]   like in order to be a creator or a podcast
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:38.520]   or create videos, all that kind of stuff, or stream.
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:42.600]   I feel like it enriches you if you pursue
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:45.720]   with your whole heart something else outside of that.
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:46.960]   Like you don't have to be, obviously,
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:49.160]   at your level of chess,
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:52.000]   but just you have to be developed
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.840]   in a passionate pursuit of something outside of that.
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:55.280]   - Yeah, you get to know what that passion,
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.240]   kind of, what it is, I think, for sure.
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:00.080]   - I think if you're only doing streaming,
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:02.240]   there's something, first of all,
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:05.920]   I feel like that's going to empty you over time.
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:08.560]   For some reason, I've seen some of the lows that people hit
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.280]   if they don't have this other passion
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:12.040]   pursued outside of streaming.
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:15.080]   But also, it'll just make you a better creator,
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:16.320]   which is interesting.
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:20.760]   I think, again, with podcasting, this applies.
[02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:23.280]   With Rogan, I think it's just would not,
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:25.680]   the reason his podcast is very good
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:30.320]   is because all of his passion is put into being a comedian
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:34.000]   and being a fight commentator.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.600]   The podcast is a side hobby.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:39.440]   That's the way I feel about it, too.
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:42.760]   Your main passion is outside of it.
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:44.680]   I don't know what that is.
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:47.640]   I think it puts everything in its proper context.
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:49.800]   And also, it allows you to mentally escape
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:54.480]   into that place that you find deeply fulfilling.
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:57.440]   You mentioned, like, offline,
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:28:59.440]   you told me that you're interested.
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:02.280]   You found it interesting that I said
[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:04.080]   that I'm renting this particular place,
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:09.080]   and I always rent because of the sense of freedom it gives.
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:13.920]   I tend to actually try to be a minimalist for the most part
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:15.800]   when it comes to things like clothes
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.760]   or owning cars, for example, or watches.
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:22.760]   I don't own a lot of these material things.
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:24.640]   They don't really interest me.
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:27.360]   But at the end of the day, the one thing is,
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:29.280]   and this might actually play a role
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:31.320]   in a lot of the hiccups, why I didn't get
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:33.400]   to maybe being closer to world champion,
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:35.960]   is that one of the things from the time
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:38.240]   that I was very young is I didn't grow up
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.720]   from a wealthy background.
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:43.360]   And I had a single mother for the first six years of my life.
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:44.720]   She worked as an elementary teacher
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:46.040]   to support my brother and myself.
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:50.320]   So I saw a lot of these sort of lows in life early on now,
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:51.880]   even once she remarried.
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:54.640]   All the money that my stepfather made was, not all of it,
[02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:57.560]   but a lot of it was directed towards my mom and I
[02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:59.200]   traveling to tournaments internationally,
[02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:00.920]   or even in the US.
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:02.480]   So seeing some of these struggles,
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:04.080]   once I actually made it as a chess player,
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:07.000]   and this goes back to investing as well,
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.880]   is that it's kind of like you wanna be secure
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:09.720]   at a certain point.
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:11.240]   So I've always looked at that,
[02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:15.880]   how do you get to that point at the end of the day?
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:18.040]   And again, like I said, with my experiences,
[02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:20.000]   seeing, actually even now, my stepfather,
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.880]   he's 72 years old, still teaches chess all the time,
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:26.400]   probably works harder than I do, actually.
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:28.720]   And so I see things like that,
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:30.040]   and that really interested me,
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:32.320]   how do you get from point A to point B?
[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:34.440]   And that's in large part what led to it.
[02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:37.360]   That being said, obviously, when you start owning things
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:41.440]   like properties, houses, or condos and whatnot,
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:42.880]   there are headaches that come along with
[02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:44.400]   getting some of these bills in the mail,
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:48.320]   or you see HOA about a tenant not parking their car illegally,
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:51.400]   $50 that you have to pay in fees, these sorts of things.
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:53.320]   It is kind of a pain,
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:58.280]   but I try to reduce the number of things
[02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:00.040]   that can really bother me in life,
[02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:02.720]   and that's really the only thing that I let,
[02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:04.120]   not let, but it's one of those things,
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:06.520]   the only things that kind of ties me down in a way.
[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:08.600]   And I still feel pretty free, though,
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:10.400]   for the most part, despite owning.
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:11.760]   - But you mentioned security,
[02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:13.800]   so that meaning like security stability?
[02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:15.520]   - Stability, yeah, sorry.
[02:31:15.520 --> 02:31:19.320]   - So that's the thing you chase, you value.
[02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:20.960]   - When it comes to chess, as I said,
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:22.920]   if you're a pro player, you can do very well,
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:24.440]   make a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:26.140]   Of course, I'm talking pre-tax,
[02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:30.640]   but if you do poorly in one year, that income dries up,
[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:32.960]   and there is a chance you'll never get back there.
[02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:34.680]   So I feel like for much of my career,
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:36.440]   that was always on my mind.
[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:38.360]   And maybe that held me back to some degree.
[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:42.160]   I don't know those sort of thoughts about things like that,
[02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:45.720]   as opposed to purely being focused only on chess,
[02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:46.680]   like worrying about the results,
[02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:49.140]   worrying about the prizes, things like this.
[02:31:49.140 --> 02:31:50.160]   It might've held me back,
[02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:52.920]   but that was always something that was on my mind.
[02:31:52.920 --> 02:31:57.080]   - For me, I really worked hard to make sure
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:01.880]   that I'm philosophically, intellectually, spiritually,
[02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:04.860]   in every way, I'm okay with having nothing,
[02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:07.240]   as close to nothing as you can get.
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:10.920]   And the reason I want that is so that I have the freedom
[02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:14.160]   to not crave stability, or rather have stability,
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:16.680]   because my bar for stability is so low.
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:19.880]   And that gives me the freedom to take big risks.
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:21.800]   And I thought that for me,
[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:25.000]   I felt like the way I could really help the world
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.040]   is by optimizing the positive I can do,
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.960]   and for that, you have to take big risks.
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:33.800]   And big risks really does mean
[02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:37.160]   potentially losing everything.
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:39.820]   - So you're saying like startups, you mean like that?
[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:42.340]   - Yeah, startups in every aspect,
[02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:47.340]   meaning pivoting career paths completely
[02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:49.380]   when everybody else is telling you not to do that.
[02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:50.500]   - Actually, it's interesting,
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:52.380]   'cause when I think about streaming,
[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:55.820]   it's not a startup, 'cause I'm not investing money
[02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:58.160]   where I can lose everything if it's not successful.
[02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:00.420]   But it was also a big risk for me doing that,
[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:01.520]   because at the time,
[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:03.620]   I was a professional player doing very well.
[02:33:03.620 --> 02:33:05.760]   When I kind of started in October 2018,
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:08.160]   I was still top 10 in the world doing very well.
[02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:10.100]   2019 was actually a very bad year for me.
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:11.520]   I started playing much worse.
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:13.680]   And towards the end of 2019,
[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:15.620]   I intended to take a six-month break.
[02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:17.980]   Last time I played was November 2019 in India.
[02:33:17.980 --> 02:33:19.040]   And then I was gonna take a break
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:21.460]   until the US Championship in April of 2020.
[02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:24.260]   So I did, in a sense, actually take a risk,
[02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:27.580]   because I was potentially risking my career
[02:33:27.580 --> 02:33:30.440]   by spending this extra time that I had streaming.
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:32.700]   So it's not the risk where financially
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:33.700]   I can lose everything,
[02:33:33.700 --> 02:33:35.300]   but it actually was a bit of a risk
[02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:37.420]   now that I think about it in a sense.
[02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:39.100]   Because if I lose my career as a player,
[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:41.100]   there's no guarantee that streaming
[02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:44.020]   is gonna be anything substantial.
[02:33:44.020 --> 02:33:46.180]   - You didn't think it was a risk at the time?
[02:33:46.180 --> 02:33:49.420]   - I think at the time, I just, I don't know.
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:51.340]   I thought it was just something fun to spend my time on.
[02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:54.740]   I didn't somehow, I don't know.
[02:33:54.740 --> 02:33:56.980]   I figured that after a six-month break,
[02:33:56.980 --> 02:33:59.740]   I would come back and play better chess, kind of.
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:01.260]   But as far as streaming,
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:02.980]   I never thought of it as being something
[02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:04.740]   that would be a career, something viable.
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:07.180]   I just thought it's something fun to do.
[02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:10.020]   Maybe it gives fans some access to me.
[02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:11.100]   It broadens the platform.
[02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:12.100]   More people hear about me.
[02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:13.580]   And that was about it, really.
[02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:16.660]   I did not ever expect it to become what it did.
[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:18.740]   - You said growing up with a single mother
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:24.960]   and just giving your whole life to chess at a certain point.
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:30.540]   Has there been through that low points,
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:35.220]   maybe times when you felt lonely, isolated,
[02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:36.940]   maybe even depressed?
[02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:38.820]   - Oh, absolutely.
[02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:39.940]   Chess is very difficult.
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:41.580]   You're on your own.
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:43.580]   You can have friends, people you compete against
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:44.900]   who are friends, but at the end of the day,
[02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:46.620]   it's a very singular pursuit.
[02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:49.180]   It's just you, and your results dictate everything.
[02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:53.420]   So there have been many moments throughout my life
[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:54.920]   when I've struggled.
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:59.100]   I think probably the biggest time when that happened
[02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:02.380]   would have been about 2005 into 2006,
[02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:04.840]   where I stopped playing chess and I went to college.
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:07.380]   And that was mainly because I had gotten to a level
[02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:09.300]   where I was top 100 in the world,
[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:12.300]   but I stagnated for that year, about 2005, 2006.
[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:13.820]   And so I decided to go to college
[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:15.580]   primarily because I had stagnated.
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:17.040]   I didn't feel like I was going anywhere.
[02:35:17.040 --> 02:35:19.500]   And then also kind of being on your own,
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:21.500]   just having a few friends here or there in the chess world,
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:22.980]   you kind of, you wonder what it's like.
[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:25.800]   And especially because I was homeschooled as well,
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:28.020]   like that further added to kind of wanting
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:30.380]   to be around other people.
[02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:32.500]   It really played a very big role
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:34.980]   in my decision to go to college.
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:37.300]   But at the end of the day, as I realized,
[02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:39.400]   college kind of was a big disappointment
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:42.060]   because the strongest or the biggest strength
[02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:44.340]   of playing chess is that you mingle with people
[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:46.380]   from all different backgrounds, all different ages.
[02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:49.380]   And when I went to college, the whole notion of basically
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:51.900]   people who are juniors and seniors being more important
[02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:55.820]   or more equal than others to do the animal farm line,
[02:35:55.820 --> 02:35:57.200]   like when you're in that situation,
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.340]   it didn't really jive with my childhood
[02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:00.900]   and growing up in the world of chess.
[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:02.520]   And that is one of the biggest reasons
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:04.180]   that I actually came back to chess
[02:36:04.180 --> 02:36:07.380]   'cause it's like this world of where certain people
[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:10.660]   can are more important and things are different,
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:12.460]   like I just could not really relate to that.
[02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:15.340]   And that was one of the biggest reasons, it really was.
[02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:17.660]   That wasn't the only reason.
[02:36:17.660 --> 02:36:20.500]   The other reason though, was that towards the end
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:22.500]   of my first semester, I played a tournament
[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:25.240]   after not studying, actually when I was in college,
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:26.740]   when I wasn't actually studying for class,
[02:36:26.740 --> 02:36:30.460]   I was mainly on poker stars playing poker all night long.
[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:32.740]   So like towards the end of that semester,
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:35.300]   I actually went to play a tournament in Philadelphia
[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:37.020]   'cause I was going to college nearby.
[02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:40.140]   And with very little preparation, I won that tournament
[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:41.780]   against other strong grandmasters.
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:44.860]   And that kind of made me think, well, okay,
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:47.180]   if I'm ever gonna take a chance, it has to be now.
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:48.860]   If I stay in college for four years,
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:53.180]   probably get a major in political science,
[02:36:53.180 --> 02:36:55.320]   do something in the political arena.
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:58.160]   And then I felt like I'm gonna probably look back
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:00.560]   like five, 10 years from now and wonder what if?
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.080]   What if I had played chess, how far could I have gone?
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:05.480]   And if I had taken those four years,
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:07.340]   there would have been no opportunity for me
[02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:10.400]   to reach my full potential or even see how far I go.
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.000]   So therefore, that was also a big, big reason.
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.480]   - So another what if question, if you didn't play chess,
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:21.340]   you mentioned political, what other possible--
[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:22.180]   - That depends.
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:25.320]   - Successful trajectory might have you had?
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:27.400]   - That depends on what point, really,
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:29.560]   if when you ask that question.
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:31.960]   I think if we're talking about the time of college,
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:35.220]   probably I would have done something in political science,
[02:37:35.220 --> 02:37:38.400]   maybe law, being a lobbyist or something terrible like that,
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:39.940]   honestly.
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:42.160]   If I was a little bit younger, I really,
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:44.840]   I loved ancient history, archeology,
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:46.300]   and also languages as well.
[02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:48.440]   So probably something along those lines.
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:52.120]   And if we talk like more recently, something in finance,
[02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:55.020]   I don't know what exactly, but something in finance.
[02:37:55.020 --> 02:37:58.700]   - What do you think, when we talk again, 30 years,
[02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:00.260]   what do you think you're doing?
[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:01.300]   - 30 years.
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:05.740]   I honestly wanna believe that I'm just sitting
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:08.940]   in a beach house in Malibu, just relaxing.
[02:38:08.940 --> 02:38:12.460]   - Yeah, right, so you and I are in a yacht for some reason.
[02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:14.140]   Why we're in a yacht?
[02:38:14.140 --> 02:38:15.900]   You paid for it, it's your yacht.
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:17.780]   - I don't ever wanna own a yacht.
[02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:19.580]   - Nope, okay, all right, fine.
[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:23.920]   But I mean, that's like the amount of money you waste
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:28.480]   on docking fees, the gas, like no way, no way.
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:30.280]   - I guess I was trying to construct an example.
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.920]   You're being super rich for some reason.
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:32.760]   It doesn't have to be that.
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:34.720]   - That actually, no, I don't think that,
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:37.680]   that actually does not appeal to me at all.
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:41.000]   I think another great thing about chess
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.080]   is that within the chess world,
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:44.140]   I'm very prominent and famous,
[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:47.040]   but I can go out to the supermarket and nobody recognize me.
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:49.940]   And so I am famous, but I'm not famous at the same time.
[02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:52.060]   So I don't actually wanna be like,
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:53.580]   I don't want to be in a situation
[02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:55.940]   where everyone recognizes me or I'm super famous.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:59.300]   That's not, that to me sounds like a very miserable life.
[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:02.420]   I do not want TMZ chasing me down the street.
[02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:04.580]   - So you're famous in a community you love,
[02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:07.780]   and that, so whenever you plug into that community,
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:10.540]   it's always like, there's a deep connection there.
[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:12.740]   You can always escape when you need a break.
[02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:17.640]   What advice would you give to young people
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:19.600]   about career, about life?
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:22.400]   Maybe they're in high school, maybe they're in college.
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:24.120]   Maybe they wanna achieve the heights
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:25.680]   that you have achieved in chess.
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:27.800]   They wanna do that for something they care about.
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:31.000]   - Yeah, so I think the main thing is follow your heart,
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:31.880]   follow your passion.
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:34.000]   One thing we didn't touch on this,
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.160]   like both my parents, my mom was a musician.
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:39.200]   She was very good.
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:41.120]   I think she was like maybe all state in California
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:43.240]   when she was growing up on the violin,
[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:45.020]   but she still was nowhere near good enough
[02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:47.300]   to get into Juilliard or the top music schools
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:49.520]   and pursue that as a career.
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:51.140]   And there are a lot of starving musicians
[02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:53.500]   who never are able to quite make it.
[02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:57.620]   So like when I see my mom and what happened with her,
[02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:00.180]   you know, her passion, the fact she wasn't able to make it,
[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:02.380]   or then my stepfather, who we haven't talked about.
[02:40:02.380 --> 02:40:05.860]   My stepfather actually, he's of Sri Lankan descent.
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:08.420]   He comes from a family of lawyers.
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:10.980]   His father was a lawyer, his uncle was a lawyer
[02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:12.940]   for the International Court of Justice.
[02:40:12.940 --> 02:40:14.120]   So it's a family of lawyers.
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:17.920]   And my stepfather, he went to England to study law.
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:19.520]   He went to Southampton.
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:21.400]   I think it was University of Southampton.
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.600]   And at some point, he was going and playing
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:25.080]   these tournaments on the weekend,
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:27.400]   playing at the school club, all these things.
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:30.480]   And his parents actually, they took away his chess board.
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:31.920]   They took away his chess books.
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:33.440]   They took everything away and told him
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:34.680]   he was going to become a lawyer.
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:36.520]   He could not play chess.
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:40.360]   So when I look at my upbringing,
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:42.380]   I feel very lucky that my parents,
[02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:43.980]   having had these experiences,
[02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:45.980]   they were so supportive of everything I did.
[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:47.580]   And I think that at the end of the day,
[02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:50.300]   you have to pursue your passion,
[02:40:50.300 --> 02:40:51.740]   to whatever end that might be.
[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:53.900]   You might pursue it, you might fail,
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:40:55.780]   but I do think you have to pursue it.
[02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:58.200]   It's better, what's it, it's better to have tried and failed
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:40:59.340]   than to have not tried at all.
[02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:01.900]   So I really do believe that's the most important thing
[02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:03.820]   is that you do that.
[02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:05.260]   And where it takes you, who knows,
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:07.500]   but the experiences I feel are much more important
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:09.980]   than like the what-ifs and possibly missing out
[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:10.820]   on living life.
[02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:14.360]   - So even if it's, you know, everybody around you
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:16.440]   in your own judgment says that this is not going
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:19.480]   to be financially viable long-term, still pursue?
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:21.000]   - I think, I mean, at some point you have to make
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.720]   those tough decisions, but absolutely.
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:25.440]   I feel like too many people follow the standard route.
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:27.320]   It's like you're supposed to, you know, go to college,
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:29.960]   get that degree, be $200,000 in debt,
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:31.280]   these sorts of things.
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:34.440]   But then at the end of the day, are you really living?
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:35.720]   Are you pursuing what you want to pursue?
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:37.760]   It's just because that's what you're supposed to do.
[02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:39.000]   That's what society tells us,
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.360]   that you're the route you're supposed to go.
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:44.720]   So I think you just have to, you pursue it.
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:46.160]   Of course, at a certain point, if you're not making it,
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:47.240]   you have to make hard decisions.
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:48.960]   But I think that, you know, in life,
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:53.000]   the only thing really, you know, time and sort of experiences
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:54.880]   those are the only things that you really
[02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:56.120]   can't put a price on.
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:59.960]   - Yeah, and, you know, and really pursue it.
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:02.600]   You know, even like streaming, I'll see people
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:04.240]   like on YouTube with that kind of stuff.
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:07.520]   It's a world in many ways foreign to me.
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:11.320]   It's like, there's levels to this game in that like,
[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:12.840]   there's a way to really pursue it
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:14.200]   and there's a way to half-ass it.
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:16.880]   And I guess the point is not to half-ass it.
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:21.880]   Like, don't, you know, don't just keep it a hobby.
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.480]   Make it a full-time, if that's your passion,
[02:42:25.480 --> 02:42:27.000]   then go all out.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.500]   So sometimes people can think that like,
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:32.800]   these things they love is just a hobby,
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:34.700]   like music or something like that.
[02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:38.700]   But there's a way to do it seriously, to go all out, yeah.
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:42.660]   - That's probably my general advice is like,
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:43.820]   whatever it is, you pursue it.
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:46.560]   Because even with chess, when I dropped out of college,
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:48.460]   there was no guarantee that I was gonna make it
[02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:49.820]   as a professional player.
[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:51.220]   There was no guarantee.
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:54.980]   But like, I took that chance and very fortunately for me,
[02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:56.500]   it worked out.
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:58.620]   - Would you rather fight a horse-sized duck
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:00.680]   or a hundred duck-sized horses?
[02:43:02.580 --> 02:43:04.940]   - Probably a horse-sized duck.
[02:43:04.940 --> 02:43:08.580]   Just one enemy is better than having to keep an eye on 100.
[02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:09.980]   - This, the stress or what?
[02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:10.820]   The anxiety?
[02:43:10.820 --> 02:43:15.820]   You don't, why don't you like a hundred?
[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:17.640]   I mean, they're tiny.
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:18.480]   - Tiny?
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:20.100]   - Duck-sized horses.
[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:21.380]   - Well, I don't know if they're gonna attack you or not,
[02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:23.100]   but I feel like having one enemy saying
[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:26.920]   like the clear objective, I would always, I prefer that.
[02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:30.260]   - If you could be someone else for a day,
[02:43:31.980 --> 02:43:35.380]   alive or dead, who would you be?
[02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:37.100]   - Who would I wanna be for a day?
[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:40.380]   If I had to pick someone, actually,
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:41.960]   I would probably pick Elon.
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:44.940]   When, how many years ago is now?
[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:46.560]   When the rockets were blowing up.
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:49.060]   I'd be very interested to see those processes
[02:43:49.060 --> 02:43:50.980]   of how they went through that
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:52.840]   and they got out on the other side.
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:56.100]   'Cause like, I feel like most of the time
[02:43:56.100 --> 02:43:57.840]   when you hear about the startups,
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:43:59.160]   like, okay, you look at Amazon.
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:01.060]   You have the big investment, the start.
[02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:04.140]   It doesn't feel like there were those super, super lows
[02:44:04.140 --> 02:44:05.620]   for like the Amazons of the world.
[02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:06.940]   Maybe not when the three rocks blew up,
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:09.380]   but maybe when that, was it fourth or fifth one?
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:12.600]   Actually succeeded, but somewhere in that timeframe.
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:15.140]   - Yeah, that is probably one of the lowest lows
[02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:17.100]   that I've publicly I've ever seen.
[02:44:17.100 --> 02:44:18.940]   Yeah, that's, yeah.
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:20.580]   - Those are the moments that make us.
[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:22.740]   - If everyone on earth disappeared
[02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:26.140]   through a horrible atrocity and it was just you left,
[02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:28.420]   what would your days look like?
[02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:29.460]   What would you do?
[02:44:29.460 --> 02:44:30.300]   - It's just me.
[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:31.140]   It's just dead bodies everywhere.
[02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:32.460]   - There's a movie like this, right?
[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:34.420]   - There's many movies like this.
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:38.060]   - Honestly, if I could, I would probably just,
[02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:39.500]   but you're saying there's like no life,
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:41.300]   like no plants, none of this stuff at all?
[02:44:41.300 --> 02:44:42.500]   - No, there's life.
[02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:43.620]   - There's life, just not in humans.
[02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:45.460]   - Not in human life.
[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:46.940]   There's like goats and stuff.
[02:44:46.940 --> 02:44:50.540]   - I remember reading a, I mean, it's slightly different,
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:52.380]   there was a sci-fi book I read many years ago.
[02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:54.060]   I think it was "Rendezvous with Rama,"
[02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:54.900]   where I think there were people
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:56.660]   that were just going all over the land,
[02:44:56.660 --> 02:44:58.520]   like in this cylinder.
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:01.780]   And so I think for me, I would just explore,
[02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:04.700]   I would just like walk, bicycle, maybe plant,
[02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:07.060]   plant some trees, things of this nature.
[02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:10.900]   - I wonder how that would change your experience of nature,
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:13.340]   knowing that it truly is,
[02:45:13.340 --> 02:45:16.100]   'cause that's one of the magical things with nature,
[02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:19.140]   it's humbling that it's just you out there.
[02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:20.500]   - That's why I love it.
[02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:23.180]   That's why I love going hiking,
[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:24.300]   'cause obviously you get the exercise,
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:27.580]   but honestly it's a reminder of how small we really are.
[02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:29.260]   - And here you would realize,
[02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:33.440]   I mean, it's an extra humbling effect
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:36.360]   of like you really are alone out here.
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:38.600]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:42.760]   I probably spend a lot of time just thinking about,
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:44.760]   thinking about everything too.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:47.760]   - Do you hate losing in chess or do you love winning?
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:49.640]   - Do I hate losing or do I love winning?
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:51.640]   I think I love winning.
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:55.360]   I mean, maybe 'cause I'm doing so many different things,
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:57.400]   like losing doesn't have the same effect on me
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:45:59.260]   that it once did.
[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:01.600]   So I think like now I definitely love winning more,
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:02.440]   but I think when I was younger,
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:06.980]   I hated losing much more than I liked winning.
[02:46:06.980 --> 02:46:08.820]   - What comforts you on bad days?
[02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:12.320]   - I think similar to what gives me the motivation
[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:14.520]   for streaming is the fact that at the end of the day,
[02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:17.660]   no matter how bad things appear or seem,
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:20.480]   I mean, we've never been at a better time in human history.
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:23.320]   People have things much better off now than any other time.
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:25.960]   So I find it hard to really have pity,
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:28.040]   or not have pity, but like feel really bad.
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:31.720]   I just use those sorts of things as like the way to get over
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:33.720]   is just knowing how lucky I am.
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.160]   - What's the role of love in the human condition?
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:40.640]   Let me ask if Hikaru about love.
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.800]   - Love is, I mean, I think it can be the greatest thing
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:45.640]   in the world.
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:48.240]   I think when it, you know, when things fall apart,
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:51.000]   like, you know, I've been through this
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]   quite a few times actually.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:56.960]   Some really real highs, some really real lows as well.
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:47:00.200]   I think love is, it can inspire you to do things
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:01.840]   you never thought were possible.
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:06.640]   And without it though, I think life is very empty.
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:08.440]   I think it's probably the most important thing
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:11.560]   to have in life in one way or another.
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:14.160]   - Which is extra sad if you were the last person
[02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:15.520]   left on Earth.
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:16.920]   - Right, exactly, yeah.
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:20.580]   I mean, I think, again, also in terms of chess,
[02:47:20.580 --> 02:47:22.840]   I think that it can be, as far as chess goes,
[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:25.360]   or any competition, it can be the greatest thing
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:27.400]   in the world, it can also be the worst thing in the world
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:28.240]   when you're in love.
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:31.080]   A lot of chess players, for many, it does not help them.
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:33.120]   It actually makes them play much worse chess
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:36.120]   because you kind of, you don't have that energy
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:38.140]   or that drive in the same kind of way.
[02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:40.880]   So it's very mixed for chess.
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:43.040]   As far as me personally though, I think, you know,
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:44.000]   I would say what I've said before,
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.240]   it's better to have loved and lost
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:46.600]   than to never have loved at all.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:48.880]   And I definitely have been through that.
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:51.240]   - I thought you don't care.
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:52.240]   I thought you don't care.
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:53.560]   (laughing)
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:56.600]   Turns out you care sometimes, a little bit, a tiny bit,
[02:47:56.600 --> 02:47:58.560]   a very, very, very tiny bit, Hikaru.
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:01.280]   You're an amazing person, I'm a huge fan.
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:03.280]   It's really an honor that you would talk with me today.
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:05.160]   I can't wait to see what you do next.
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:07.280]   - Thank you, it was good being here.
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:08.760]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:10.440]   with Hikaru Nakamura.

[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:16.320]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:17.600]   from David Bronstein.
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:21.760]   It is my style to take my opponent and myself
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:23.960]   onto unknown grounds.
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:27.040]   A game of chess is not an examination of knowledge.
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:30.320]   It is a battle of nerves.
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:33.400]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:36.000]   (upbeat music)
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.600]   (upbeat music)
