[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.680]   On Instagram, most of us are happy if 20 or 30 people
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.480]   like any given picture that we post.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.220]   We're back with hip hop artist, Tripp Lee.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.480]   And Tripp, some of your pictures
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.500]   go over 10,000 likes on Instagram.
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.840]   Social media stats like these beg us,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.180]   just beg us to compare ourselves to everyone else
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.680]   and to quantify our popularity,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.360]   which of course is pure vanity.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.360]   So speak to nobodies like me about fame
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.960]   and particularly about this idea
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.080]   that popularity is the key to happiness.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.040]   Speak to us from the inside.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880]   Yeah, I think that is one of the really dangerous things
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.240]   about social media is with all kinds of hearts
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.040]   and love and praise, man, it's always been that.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.260]   But now, as you said, there is this kind of automatic way
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.440]   that I can at any moment know exactly what people think
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.580]   about what I just said, what I just did,
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.800]   or this picture that I just took.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.720]   I don't have to wait or ask anybody.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.840]   I can second by second see
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080]   how many people think it's impressive.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.520]   And from my side, as somebody who has
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.120]   a larger social media following,
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.700]   I think the main thing I want people to know
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.840]   is that no amount of likes really satisfies.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.000]   There's no like, okay, when I get that 10,000 likes,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.200]   that's when my heart is really satisfied.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.920]   And we see principles like this in scripture.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.000]   Solomon says, and I think it's Ecclesiastes 5,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.480]   he who loves money will never be satisfied by it.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.000]   And that's 'cause we'll always want more.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880]   You know, it's vanity, chasing after wind.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.800]   And I guess you could really say the same thing.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.640]   He who loves social media likes or retweets
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.260]   will never be satisfied by it.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.680]   And that's because when our real hunger
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.440]   is for that recognition from man,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.400]   then enough is never gonna be enough.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.060]   You know, if that's what we really hunger for,
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.280]   there's never gonna be that magic amount of recognition
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.640]   that'll mean enough for us.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.580]   My level of social media fame is laughable
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.880]   compared to others who have millions of followers
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.600]   and get hundreds of thousands of likes.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.920]   But even they can look back to someone else in history
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.400]   who's more famous than them or somebody else
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.160]   on social media, and you know, it's an endless cycle
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.880]   of comparison and unsatisfied desires.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   You know, I can look at friends of mine,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.460]   even who have larger social media following than me,
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.880]   and I look at them, and they still haven't reached
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.840]   some level of perfect happiness.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.140]   And so I think we really have to fight that thing
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.180]   in our heart that wants to be satisfied by that.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.820]   I can think of seasons where I've personally felt
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.680]   that I needed to step back from social media
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.360]   because I was liking the likes too much and the retweets.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.480]   Because, you know, I would maybe tweet something
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.440]   and see a bunch of retweets, and it would give me
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.760]   this little burst of joy and satisfaction,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.680]   and it would make me feel good about myself.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.300]   And I was starting to see that that's what I was really
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.880]   kind of defining myself, or finding my identity.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's what made me feel valuable
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.640]   and worth something in that day.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.560]   And when I don't watch my soul,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.720]   I can feel myself getting really addicted to that,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.280]   addicted to the praise of man.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.520]   And it's really dangerous,
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.880]   whether it's on social media or at your job
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.240]   and in your family with your spouse.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.760]   When we get addicted to the praise of man,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.120]   it's very dangerous because that praise
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.180]   begins to dictate our decisions.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.360]   We'll behave or tweet or preach or rap or whatever.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.920]   We'll do it based on what will get us the most praise
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.200]   from men instead of what will please God.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.000]   And that can happen really quick.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.260]   And that can happen without us even noticing.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.740]   And it kills our faith because that's where we start
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.880]   to run to for joy.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.120]   And it really kills our obedience really quickly
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.040]   and desensitizes our souls.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.280]   And we begin to reorient our life around the wrong things.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760]   So I think social media is amazing.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.840]   But because we're sinners, just like in every era of our life
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.400]   there are things you really have to guard against.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.840]   And that's one of them for me.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.360]   Fear of man is a struggle for me.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.420]   And so I always have to fight against that.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.360]   - Yes, and how long are those seasons of pulling back?
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.760]   - Sometimes it would maybe be just a week or two.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.920]   There was one time when it was a couple months
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.900]   where maybe I would still tweet, I would schedule them.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.080]   But I just erased the apps from my phone
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.400]   so that I wouldn't be tempted to go
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.440]   and look at everybody's responses to my tweets
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.560]   and post at all times.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.920]   - That's a really good discipline for us all
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.120]   to consider sharing, but finding ways to distance ourselves
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.280]   from the response stats.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.100]   Thank you, Tripp.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.040]   This has been "Tripp Lee."
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.680]   His latest album and book are both titled "Rise."
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.320]   You can find them right now at Amazon.com.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.360]   And one of the great themes in the book is the love of God
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.440]   in his withholding things from us that would harm us.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.380]   So how does our trust in the goodness of God
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.920]   relate to self-denial?
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.680]   I'll ask Tripp that tomorrow.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.520]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.100]   (upbeat music)
