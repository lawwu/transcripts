[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.920]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the sixth chapter and the seventeenth verse.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.680]   The seventeenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.360]   And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.520]   And this morning I want particularly to call attention to the second half of that verse.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.880]   And take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:57.640]   Now here we come to look at the sixth piece or portion of the whole armor of God which
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:06.360]   the apostle exhorts these Ephesian Christians to take unto themselves and to put on.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.840]   The context you remember is that he reminds them that they've got to fight and stand against
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.600]   the viles of the devil and all the powers that are associated with the devil, the principalities
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.280]   and the powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, the spiritual wickedness, even
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.800]   in high or heavenly places.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.960]   And he says that there's only one way in order to make certain that we fight and overcome
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.360]   this terrible enemy that is set against us, and that is that we must be strong in the
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.800]   Lord and in the power of his might and we must take unto us and put on the whole armor
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.480]   of God.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   And we've been engaged in looking at the different pieces and portions of this armor which is
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.180]   provided for us as Christian people by God.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.480]   And we come here, I say, to the sixth portion.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.520]   While it is the sixth of the series given us, it is the third, of course, in the second
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520]   division.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.600]   We've seen that these pieces of armor can be divided into two main groups.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.960]   The first group of three consists of those portions which are actually attached to the
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.720]   body.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.840]   The loins are to be girt about with a belt of truth.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.560]   We are to put on a breastplate of righteousness.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.280]   And we are to have our feet shod with the sandals of the preparation of the gospel of
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.020]   peace.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.120]   But then we see there is a second group, things that we take up.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.220]   We don't fix them to the body, but we take them up when we realize the enemy is approaching
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.420]   and that we have to be ready for a skirmish.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.060]   So we see that we've got to take up the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation,
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.300]   and here lastly, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.140]   Now there are many interesting things about this last piece, this third piece in the second
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.880]   division.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.420]   It differs from all the others in three main respects, and it's a very interesting point,
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.420]   this.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.500]   It's interesting in the natural realm and therefore still more interesting when we come
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.860]   to the spiritual application.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:52.920]   You notice that this piece is not, like all the others have been, something which protects
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.940]   any particular part of the body, nor indeed, like the shield, the whole body.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.140]   Every other part that we've been looking at provides a kind of protection for the body
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.420]   as a whole or particular parts of the body.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:18.620]   Now this is no longer true when we come to consider the sword of the Spirit.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.280]   There's one interesting difference, therefore.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.860]   And another point of difference is that this is defensive, and it is a part of the defensive
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.820]   weapons that we are given.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.860]   It's defensive in the sense that it keeps back the enemy as a whole, rather than some
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.800]   particular aspect of his attack or some particular method of attack.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.760]   I mean by that that it's obvious that the breastplate, as we saw, protects the seat
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.440]   of affections, the desires and the will and things like that.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.960]   It's a particular protection, likewise with the helmet, likewise with the feet, and so
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.680]   on.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.320]   But when you come to consider the sword, as I say, it not only doesn't protect different
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.760]   parts of the body or cover the whole body as that big shield did.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.780]   This protects us in quite a different way.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.320]   It protects us in the sense that it helps us to hold back the enemy himself, as it were,
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.720]   rather than some particular action on his part.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.980]   But of course the main and the third point of difference and distinction is that this
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:45.120]   is also an offensive weapon, and this is, of course, its particular uniqueness.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.400]   There was no element of the offensive in any of the other five parts of the whole armour
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:00.520]   of God, but here there is, so that it serves a dual purpose, defensive and offensive.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.800]   It's something whereby we can not only repel the enemy but also attack him.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.320]   Now this is the most important aspect of this whole matter.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.580]   It throws light, of course, on phrases in the scriptures such as that we read just now
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:24.620]   in the fourth chapter of the epistle of James, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you."
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.220]   You'll not merely hold him up, as it were.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.220]   He'll run away.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.220]   He'll disappear.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.780]   He'll flee.
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.060]   And this is, I say, the important aspect of the matter.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:44.540]   It teaches us that we have not merely to repel or to resist in a negative sense the enemy
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:52.740]   and his various attacks, but that there is to be also a positive element in what we do
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.660]   with respect to the enemy.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.940]   We are not only, I say, merely to resist him.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.300]   We are to repel him.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.340]   He's to be discomfited, in a sense, and he is to be caused to retreat.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.300]   We are to drive him back.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.220]   Now this, I think we'll all agree, is a very important aspect of this Christian warfare
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.580]   in which we find ourselves.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:25.620]   One of our main troubles is that the devil tends to terrorise us and to frighten us and
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:31.740]   to produce in us a craven spirit and a feeling of hopelessness.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:37.660]   And of course, as long as he succeeds in doing that, we are already defeated.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:45.000]   Now this reminder about the sword is the real antidote to that.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.180]   It reminds us that if we view these things in the New Testament way, we must not fear
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:08:00.380]   the devil in that craven sense of fear, but we must be confident in our ability to resist
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.940]   him.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:08.580]   We must have this assurance that though he is so great and powerful, and all that we've
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.460]   seen concerning him and his forces, it's not a hopeless battle.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.220]   It is possible for the Christian to resist the devil and to cause him to flee.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:28.240]   Now I must qualify that by saying this, that this is not an encouragement to foolhardiness.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.580]   This is not an encouragement to a spirit of jocularity with respect to the devil.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.760]   The world regards the devil, as we've seen so often, as a jerk.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.460]   And indeed there are many in the Christian church who tend to do the same thing.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.900]   But you will remember the warnings of the second epistle of Peter in the second chapter
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.580]   and the epistle of Jude.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.380]   We are not to speak evil of dignitaries.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.880]   We are not to bring a railing accusation against the devil.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   The foolhardy Christian is nothing but a fool.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.900]   We must never forget the might and the power and the strength of this great enemy that
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.060]   is set against us.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.740]   But at the same time, I say, we are not to be terrified.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.320]   We mustn't be terrified by this adversary.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:23.660]   We must stand and withstand and use this sword of the Spirit in such a manner that we shall
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.940]   cause him to flee from us.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:32.260]   Now that's the kind of balance which we have with regard to this subject in the New
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.100]   Testament teaching.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.160]   It's not a foolish overconfidence, feeling that because we are Christians we have nothing
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   to fear.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.180]   The answer to that is, "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:52.140]   But at the same time, I say, we must avoid this being terrorized by the devil and this
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:58.300]   feeling of utter hopelessness because of his great power and strength.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:04.020]   Very well, there is, it seems to me, the first great lesson that is taught us here.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:10.020]   Well now we must proceed to the detailed description which is given by the apostle.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.820]   We are to take the sword of the Spirit.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.420]   Now why does he describe the sword in that way, do you think?
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.860]   Why is it the sword of the Spirit?
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.560]   And the answer is that it is the sword which the Spirit gives or the sword which the Spirit
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   supplies.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:36.340]   But then he adds further, "the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God."
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.460]   And it's important that we should be clear as to what this means.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:47.920]   Now this new popular translation translates it like this, "For sword, take that which
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.620]   the Spirit gives you, the words that come from God."
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.740]   I confess freely that I have no idea what they mean by that.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:06.140]   I have turned up every translation that I know of and without any exception, apart from
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.980]   this new translation, they all have the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:21.100]   But this says, you see, the words that come from God, opening the door to mysticism, to
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.260]   certain feelings or words that may come to us at the time in the realm of the Spirit.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:33.380]   And that seems to me to be an entire contradiction of what the apostle is teaching at this point.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.660]   It isn't words that come from God.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.220]   The sword of the Spirit is the Word of God.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.940]   Then there's another false interpretation of this which has sometimes been current which
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:54.820]   puts it like this, "Take the sword of the Spirit which is," that's to say, the Spirit
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.700]   is, "the Word of God."
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.980]   But this is obviously wrong because nowhere in the Scripture is the Holy Spirit described
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.580]   as the Word of God.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.860]   That description is confined solely to our Lord himself.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.540]   So that cannot be right.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.060]   The Spirit is not the sword.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.540]   Well what is the apostle saying?
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:25.260]   Well, what he's saying is this, "Take up the sword which the Spirit himself provides
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.260]   for you."
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.260]   What is that?
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.940]   It is the Word of God.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.480]   In other words, the Scriptures, the Bible.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:41.200]   And that is my main reason for calling attention to this wrong translation of this new edition.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.120]   It isn't words that come from God.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.660]   It is this Word of God, the Scriptures.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.200]   And you will see the tremendous difference that that makes immediately.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.180]   But I want to try to prove this and show that it's not merely my idea but that it is something
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.460]   which is inevitably true, that this is a reference to the Bible itself, the Scriptures, the Word
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.940]   of God.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.580]   And my proof is this.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.800]   It's what happened to our blessed Lord himself.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.260]   You remember how we read at the beginning that he went to be baptized of John in the
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.540]   Jordan.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.500]   And as he was there coming up out of the water, the Spirit descended upon him in the form
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.420]   of a dove.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.260]   He was filled with the Spirit.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.660]   We are told the Spirit is not given by measure unto him.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.500]   He was filled with the Spirit.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.860]   And then you notice the interesting thing that follows.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:45.300]   Here is our Lord having been filled with the Spirit in order that he may perform his function.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:51.300]   We read at the beginning of the fourth chapter of Matthew's Gospel, "Then was Jesus,
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.580]   led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil."
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.460]   And then there follows the account of the temptations.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.100]   But this is the interesting thing.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:11.380]   How did our Lord, filled with the Spirit in this way, resist the temptations of the devil?
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.060]   And you remember the answer.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.220]   He did so by quoting the Scriptures.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.660]   He didn't merely speak words that were given to him by God at the moment.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.620]   He didn't merely utter words that came to him from God.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.260]   He quoted the Word of God.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.420]   He quoted the Scriptures.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.820]   And there is no question at all that the Apostle has all that in his mind as a background to
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.480]   what he is teaching us at this particular point.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.460]   You see, the weapon used by our Lord was the Word of God, the Scriptures.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:49.980]   And you and I are to fight the devil and all his powers with the same weapon, the sword
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.540]   of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:01.100]   The Word of God, in other words, points to the sword of the Spirit and not to the Holy
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.780]   Spirit himself.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.540]   And that in turn leads us to ask this question.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:21.540]   Why are the Scriptures described in this way and defined as the sword provided by the Spirit?
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.860]   And the answer is a very important one for us.
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.740]   There is nothing, as I want to try to show, that is more important in this fight against
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:37.860]   the devil and all these powers as that we should be perfectly clear as to this Word
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.540]   and its authority and what it means.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.340]   Well, it is the sword of the Spirit.
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.460]   It means this.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.300]   It is he who gives it.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.100]   It is something that comes altogether from him.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:58.100]   It is the Spirit who inspired the men who wrote it.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.700]   So it is the sword of the Spirit in that sense.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.180]   Let me read to you these most important statements concerning the Scriptures.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.140]   2 Timothy 3.16.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:16.100]   All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, or all Scripture is God-breathed and is profitable
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.860]   for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:29.220]   men of God may be perfect, truly furnished, and to all good works.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:35.740]   Now there is our first statement reminding us that the Scriptures are given to us by
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   God himself, the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:45.660]   And then there is the equally famous statement in the second epistle of Peter in the first
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.220]   chapter, reading from verse 19 to the end.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:56.860]   We have also a more sure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well that ye take heed, as
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:02.260]   unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:10.740]   in your hearts, knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.860]   interpretation.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:19.740]   For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of men, but holy men of God speak as
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.220]   they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.280]   And that means this, no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:36.460]   That means that the prophets and the prophecies which we have of the prophets in the Old Testament
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.560]   are not merely the private opinions of those prophets.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.220]   It isn't their understanding and interpretation of the times and of the future.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.380]   That's not it.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.860]   No Scripture is like that.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.400]   No prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.740]   It isn't something that the prophets excogitated, as it were, out of their own minds and put
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.540]   before us their ideas and theories.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.180]   They were not seers, they were more than that.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.180]   Well what was it?
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:10.340]   Well he says, prophecy came not in old time by the will of men.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.420]   Man is never able to produce this.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:22.100]   But holy men of God speak as they were moved or carried along or born along by the Holy
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.860]   Spirit.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:31.120]   So there is every reason for describing the Word of God as the sword of the Spirit.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.960]   He produces it.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:39.060]   He gave the men the revelation, he guided them in the recording of the revelation.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.860]   So that this is not a mere human document, a human word, it is indeed God's own out-breathed
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.920]   Word.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.520]   It was breathed into these men and they wrote it.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.480]   Very well then, this is, I say, a very vital and a very fundamental matter.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.680]   That this particular weapon that is provided for us is indeed a part of the whole armor
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.000]   of God.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.080]   We are not fighting the devil here in our own strength or power with our own ideas.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.680]   We are to fight him with this Word that the very Spirit of God himself has produced.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.480]   In other words, the Holy Spirit is the author of the Scriptures.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.920]   That doesn't mean that the men who wrote were mechanical, but it does mean that the
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:31.280]   Holy Spirit is the author who so took up these men and guided them and inspired them as to
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:37.000]   give them the revelation and the ability to write it without any error.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.560]   Now, when you consider the strength and the power of the enemy that is against us, you
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:49.520]   will see the importance of realizing the strength and the power of this particular weapon.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.000]   But it doesn't stop even at that.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.800]   It is the Holy Spirit alone that enables us to understand this Word.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.600]   Here is something that is stated frequently in the Scriptures.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.040]   You have got a wonderful statement of it, for instance, in the second chapter of Paul's
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:16.360]   He says, "We have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit that
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:24.640]   is of God, that in order that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.640]   God."
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.800]   And we can't know them without that.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.720]   His argument is this, you remember, that when the Son of God was here in this world in the
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.760]   flesh, the princes of this world didn't know him.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.280]   They didn't recognize him.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.160]   The princes like the Pharisees and scribes and doctors of the law, the princes such as
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.880]   the Greek philosophers and all these, they saw nothing but a man, they saw but a carpenter,
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.160]   they dismissed him and derided him, they didn't know him.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.680]   For had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   Well then, how does anyone come to believe him?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.920]   The apostle gives the answer, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.360]   the heart of men the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, but God hath
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.120]   revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:22.720]   For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.760]   The natural men receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are spiritually
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.740]   discerned, neither can he.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:37.040]   But we have the mind of Christ, he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.320]   is judged of no man.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.680]   Well now then, this is important.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:48.260]   It is the Spirit alone who enables us to understand this word and to receive this word.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:56.540]   And in the same way, it is the Holy Spirit alone that enables us to interpret this word.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.220]   You notice that it is entirely the Spirit's work.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:05.440]   Everything connected with this word is always the result of an operation of the Spirit,
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.800]   from beginning to end.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.280]   It doesn't matter how able a man is in a natural sense, that doesn't help him to
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.100]   interpret this.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.460]   He can be a genius, he can be a great scholar, but it won't help him here.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.620]   This is spiritually discerned.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.300]   It must be interpreted in a spiritual manner.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:32.540]   And nothing and no one can enable us to do that apart from the Spirit of God himself.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:39.180]   So all along the line, we see it is the sword of the Spirit.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:46.940]   And lastly, and this is perhaps the one that was uppermost in the mind of the Apostle John,
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:52.860]   it is the Holy Spirit alone that enables us to use this word properly.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:57.920]   And as he is concerned about the very practical matter of fighting the enemy and repelling
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:03.980]   him and causing him to flee, clearly this is the thing that is uppermost.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.540]   It is one thing to know the contents of this book.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.260]   It is a very different thing to know how to use it right.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:19.620]   And here again, it is the Holy Spirit alone that can enable us to do so.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.580]   Now this relationship between the Spirit and the Word is an all-important one.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:31.820]   Failure to realise that has accounted for many troubles in the long history of the Christian
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.820]   Church.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:39.300]   People always put the emphasis on one exclusively or else on the other.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.380]   And the moment you separate the Spirit and the Word, you are in trouble and are likely
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.340]   to get still more trouble.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.940]   There are some, you see, who say that having the illumination of the Spirit, you don't
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.620]   need the Word at all.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.660]   That was the tragedy of the Quakers.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:04.340]   George Fox starts with the right balance, but as he goes on, he increasingly tends to
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.340]   pay less and less attention to the Word and more and more to the inner light, the illumination
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.340]   of the Spirit.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.340]   The message is received immediately.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.300]   That is why I regard this new translation as so dangerous.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.740]   Words that come from God, that's the very thing the fanatics have always claimed.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.140]   It has been one of the greatest sources of trouble and of error in the long life of the
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.140]   Christian Church.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:33.740]   The enthusiasts, the fanatics, have always based their whole position just on that.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:41.500]   But then you see there is this other tendency at the other extreme, to discount the Spirit
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.020]   and to say that as long as we have got the open Bible and the Word here before us, and
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:51.700]   as long as we know this in some kind of mechanical sense, that we need nothing further.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:58.220]   And so the Spirit is forgotten, and you may get a dead orthodoxy, or you may get a mere
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:05.460]   intellectual, academic knowledge of the Scriptures, which rarely doesn't enable one to fight
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.820]   this battle against the devil and the principalities and the powers.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.980]   No, the whole time these must be kept together.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.500]   The Spirit has provided for us this particular instrument, but we can't use it without
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.500]   it.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.060]   It can be a dead letter to us.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.100]   The letter killeth, the Spirit giveth life.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:31.420]   The Spirit on the Word, opening the Word, opening my mind and opening my heart.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.340]   As long as you keep the two together, as the apostle does here, you cannot possibly go
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.340]   wrong.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.460]   But the devil has already divided in order that he may conquer, as it were.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:48.500]   And as I say, he has done so, so often in the long history of the Christian Church.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.340]   Well now, then, there is the kind of mechanics of our text this morning.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.380]   What's the spiritual application of all this?
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.100]   And the answer is this.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:11.460]   This is the way and the only way in which we can meet and defeat all error with respect
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.300]   to the truth.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.140]   Now the error comes in many ways, but I am concerned particularly this morning with the
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.700]   general attack upon the truth.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.140]   We have already considered specific attacks under the other headings.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:32.060]   What we are facing here, I say, is the enemy himself, as it were.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.580]   Not doing local things in terms of tactics here and there, but the whole strategy of
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.740]   the enemy to shake us from the truth altogether.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.300]   And he does so in many ways.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.100]   He does so through philosophy.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.820]   That's been an enemy from the very beginning.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:57.140]   One of the very first battles that the Christian Church had to fight was the fight against
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.660]   philosophy, Greek philosophy.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:05.100]   You see, as the Gospel spread into Europe, it came to Greece, and there was this great
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.740]   philosophic tradition, this whole outlook that says that men by seeking can find out
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:17.220]   God, that men can arrive at truth as the result of his meditation and his working out his
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.420]   theories so he can encompass truth.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:27.540]   It was a great fight in the early centuries between the Christian Church and the subtle
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.540]   attack that came from the direction of philosophy.
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.900]   Well, it's still with us, of course, and perhaps more than ever.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:40.820]   And coupled with that you can put what's called generally knowledge, any knowledge
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.220]   that man has.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:47.340]   It's always an enemy of truth, science in particular.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.860]   You see, it's in terms of this knowledge, this modern knowledge, the latest advances
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.660]   of knowledge, scientific knowledge, our awareness of things, that's how the attack comes upon
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:03.860]   the truth today as it has always come throughout the running centuries.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:09.300]   And what I'm trying to say is that the only way in which we can repel that particular
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:20.140]   attack is that we take up and wield the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.220]   There's no other answer.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.300]   There is no other way of defense.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.780]   Now, I want to show you that this is what our Lord himself did.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.980]   We must ever follow in his steps in all matters.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:38.380]   And if you read the pages of the four Gospels, you will find that our Lord did this repeatedly.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:45.340]   These clever men, Pharisees, scribes, doctors of the law, they came with their catch questions.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.340]   They said, "Who's this fellow?
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.100]   He's never been trained as a Pharisee, just a carpenter.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.340]   He's never been to the schools.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.340]   What does he learn?"
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.300]   So they brought very clever questions.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.980]   You see, they were experts in the details and the minutiae.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.100]   They were great scholars, these men.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.580]   So they came with all their great scholarship, and they thought they'd trap him and catch
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.100]   him and bring an end to his ministry.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.260]   How did he meet them?
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:12.980]   I say he always met them in the way that we have already seen when we were reading that
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.540]   account at the very beginning of the temptation in the wilderness.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.580]   But look at it more in particular.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.700]   As he dealt with these Pharisees and scribes, take one instance out of the tenth chapter
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.140]   of Luke's Gospel.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.460]   Let me read to you verses 25 and 26.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.500]   And behold, a certain lawyer stood up.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.420]   You see, a clever man, a trained man, a man who had the knowledge of the law.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.660]   That's what the lawyer means here, an expert in the Jewish law.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:48.100]   A certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, "Master, what shall I do to inherit
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.740]   eternal life?"
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.100]   He didn't want to know about eternal life.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.100]   He came tempting him, stood up and tempted him.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:00.700]   "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.740]   Hoping of course that our Lord would have delivered an opinion of his own, which he,
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   the lawyer then, would prove was not consistent with the teaching of the law.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.740]   That was his object.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.500]   But this is how our Lord met him.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.780]   He said unto him, "What is written in the law?
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.020]   How readest thou?"
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.580]   You see, he's taking up the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.060]   That's how our Lord dealt with the men.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.780]   "What is written in the law?
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.780]   What do you read?
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.060]   What do you find in the scriptures?"
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.060]   That's one typical example.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:39.100]   There's a similar one in the tenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, where
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.380]   our Lord did much the same thing, reading at verse 32.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.580]   Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:53.620]   Jesus answered them, "Many good works have I showed you from my Father.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.540]   For which of those works do you stone me?"
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:02.140]   The Jews answered him, saying, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy,
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.740]   and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God."
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.100]   Here's a subtle attack.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:15.340]   Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, 'Ye are gods'?
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:20.900]   If ye call them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken,
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.860]   say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, 'Thou blasphemest,'
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.260]   because I said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.620]   But you notice the weapon.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.660]   He took the sword of the Spirit and he smote them with it.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.380]   He not only defended himself, he discomfited them.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:44.220]   He turns the tables on them, and he does it constantly in that very way and manner.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:50.220]   Now there is the way, I say, of dealing with these general attacks upon the whole truth.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.700]   What these men were always trying to do was to discredit our Lord, to prove that he wasn't
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:02.100]   what he claimed and that his teaching was wrong, and they're still doing the same thing.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:07.780]   This new approach to truth, this philosophic understanding, how can these things be true
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:13.140]   in the light of our knowledge, the first three chapters of Genesis, the scriptural teaching
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.780]   with regard to miracles and things like that.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:21.180]   What we are facing today is an attempt to discredit the whole of Revelation, the very
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.020]   essence of our Gospel.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.940]   And I'm saying that the teaching here is that the only way in order to withstand this
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:34.500]   is to take up this sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:40.220]   Our Lord did it, and notice how the apostles did it also.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:45.980]   Read the writings of these men and you'll find that their method was always that.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.100]   Look at the apostle going into the synagogue at Thessalonica.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.740]   There he's facing Gain, saying, "Jews, how does he do?
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.740]   What does he do?"
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.260]   Well, he reasoned with them out of the scriptures, proving and alleging that the Christ must
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.500]   need suffer and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is the Christ.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.420]   Reasoned out of the scriptures.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.460]   It was always his method.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.180]   And as you read the epistles, you find the same thing.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:16.380]   They're full of scriptural quotations, full of quotations from the Old Testament.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.260]   The Gospels already do that.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.420]   As the writers write, "So it was fulfilled," they say, "which was said by the prophet."
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.980]   And these men later, in writing to the churches in order to establish points and in order
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:34.100]   to ground people in the truth, they always bring as their final argument a word of scripture,
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.540]   the Word of God.
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:44.720]   It's the great way of fighting these attacks that always come upon the church and her truth.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.260]   It was done by the apostles, I say.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.740]   It was done by the great martyrs and confessors.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:59.580]   And in particular, we see that it was the very thing that was done by Martin Luther.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.340]   It was the thing that gave being to the Protestant Reformation.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.620]   Here is a man held in darkness by the devil.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.460]   Though he's a monk, he's blinded.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.140]   He's trying to save himself by works.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.060]   He's fasting, he's sweating, he's praying.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.340]   And yet he's miserable and unhappy.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.740]   He's held in bondage, "The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.740]   believe not."
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:28.700]   There he is, in the darkness of that superstitious teaching.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.820]   What happened to him?
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:35.260]   He was delivered by the Word of Scripture, "The just shall live by faith."
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:40.420]   But it not only gave him peace himself, he began now to understand this Word as he'd
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.780]   never understood it before.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.620]   And the more he understood it, the more he saw the errors taught by Rome, he saw the
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:51.980]   error of her practice, and the more intent he was upon the reformation of that church.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.660]   And he proceeded to do it all in terms of exposition of the Scriptures.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.860]   All the great doctors in the Roman church came out against him.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:06.700]   He sometimes had to stand alone and meet them in single combat, as it were, as they argued.
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:11.200]   And what he did invariably was to stand upon the Scriptures.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.380]   He said, "The church has got to be judged by the Scripture.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.780]   The church is not above the Scripture.
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.580]   The standard by which you judge even the church is the Scripture."
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:25.100]   So he took this sword of the Spirit, and one man alone was able to fight that whole church
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.960]   and fifteen centuries of tradition.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:35.020]   He did it by just taking up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:40.660]   And our Protestant fathers in this country did exactly the same thing.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.460]   It was the one weapon which they always used.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.040]   The Puritans did exactly the same thing.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.220]   And that is why, you see, the early Protestants were so concerned that there should be an
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.120]   English translation of the Bible.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:59.900]   They said this is something that is to be understood of all the people.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:05.940]   It was the wish, you remember, of Latimer that every ploughman, every boy at the plough
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.780]   should be able to know it and to understand it.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.780]   Why?
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.300]   In order that they might be safeguarded against this false teaching of the Roman Catholic
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.020]   Church.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.540]   And the way to make people strong in that respect is to give them a knowledge of the
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.020]   Word of God.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:29.820]   Hence, the great anxiety, I say, for these translations.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.880]   Very well, it is equally true at the present time.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.940]   This is the only way in which we can withstand these various arguments.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.180]   Let me put it like this.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.140]   It doesn't matter what argument is brought forward.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.380]   We are not all experts in science.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.060]   We are not all experts in philosophy.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.820]   Well, how can we stand up against these people who bring these arguments?
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.140]   There's only one thing to do.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.580]   Don't dabble in philosophy.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.180]   Don't try and meet them on their own ground.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.380]   Take your ground.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.940]   Don't go out, I say, clad in Saul's armor.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.860]   You won't be able to walk in it and you won't be able to handle yourself and you'll be defeated
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.060]   by Goliath.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.380]   Pick up the thing that you can use, the Word of God.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.020]   Here is something that is available to every one of us.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:19.460]   And if you know this, you'll be able to answer philosophy, science, anything that may come
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.500]   against you.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:29.220]   Keep to the Word, keep to its teaching, and you will invariably cause the enemy to flee.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.460]   Now there's one very interesting aspect of this matter at the present time which I feel
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.780]   constrained to put before you.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:44.740]   Ever since the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, Protestantism has fought the
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:51.620]   battle against Rome in terms of the Bible, for the reasons I've given.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.980]   They saw it was the only way.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.140]   Indeed, it was the right way.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.420]   And it was a way that worked and was honored, of course, because the Spirit gave the sword
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.740]   and He enabled them to use it.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:11.540]   And throughout the period, the Roman Catholic Church kept the Bible from her people.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.260]   Obviously, it was the knowledge of this that delivered people from them.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.140]   So they didn't allow the people to have it in a language they could understand.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.220]   They kept it from them.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.860]   They discouraged them from reading it.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.820]   They said they couldn't possibly understand it.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.020]   They denounced this Protestant doctrine of the universal priesthood of all believers
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.620]   and that it is possible for one man with the Spirit upon him to understand.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.300]   The Church alone can interpret.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.500]   Now that's been the policy.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:42.500]   But you're aware of the fact that by today the Roman Catholic Church has changed her
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.500]   policy.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:51.500]   She is now giving the Bible to her people and encouraging her people to read the Bible.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.820]   Why the change of policy?
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:58.020]   Now this to me is one of the most significant things of this century and one of the most
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.860]   important things for us to realize.
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.660]   Why have they changed their policy?
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:10.540]   Why do they give the Scriptures to their people now and are no longer afraid to do that?
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.220]   And the answer is this.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:19.380]   I quote the words of an important dignitary in the Roman Catholic Church, not said publicly
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.780]   but said privately to a Protestant who put the question to him.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.020]   And it is a complete explanation of their reversed policy.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:35.100]   "Ah," he said, "I'll tell you why we've changed our policy.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:41.780]   There is no longer any need for us to be afraid of the Scriptures," he said, "for this reason,
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.100]   that you Protestants no longer believe the Scriptures.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:52.100]   It is you Protestants," he said, "with your destructive criticism of the Scriptures that
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.860]   have undermined the confidence of the people in the Scriptures.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.100]   It is we alone who are standing for the Scriptures now.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.780]   That's the position we are confronting."
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.700]   The Roman Catholic Church says this is the Word of God.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.780]   I know she adds her tradition, but she does stand for this.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.800]   She's been opposed to higher criticism.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:19.220]   But Protestantism in its blindness, in its folly, utterly defeated and duped by the devil,
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.840]   has undermined its own authority.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.420]   It has nothing now wherewith it can fight the battle against Rome.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.740]   It has nothing whereby it can fight philosophy.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.340]   It has nothing whereby it can fight science.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.020]   Its authority is not now the revelation of this book.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.620]   It is not the fact that this is God-breathed and God-given and God-honoured.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:45.320]   They're trying to fight in terms of philosophy and science and modern knowledge.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.700]   And that is nothing but utter defeat.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:55.540]   No, no, my friends, there is only one way to fight any enemy which attacks the whole
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:01.100]   of this Gospel, whether it be an apostate church or whether it be these infidels with
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.420]   their modern knowledge and science and philosophy.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:10.020]   The only way to fight and to repel the enemy is to take up this sword of the Spirit which
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.060]   is the Word of God.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:17.180]   If you're not certain that it's the Word of God, if you don't rely utterly, absolutely
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:22.460]   upon it, if you don't believe it's inerrant, well then I say you've got a broken sword
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:27.940]   in your hand and you're already defeated by your enemy.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.660]   But let me put it positively.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:35.940]   Take up this sword and use it in the power of the Spirit and I don't care what universities
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.220]   or scholars or anything that may arise against you.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:45.140]   Alone, like Martin Luther, you're sufficient and you'll win your enemies and the enemy
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.780]   will be driven back.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:52.540]   That leads me to a last word which is just this.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.980]   Those who attend here regularly will know that when we were interpreting the first piece,
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:03.140]   which is this, having your lines girt about with truth, I then said that I'd have to
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.540]   show the difference between that and this thing we're looking at this morning.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:11.700]   You see, you start by girting your lines about with truth.
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:16.300]   What's the difference between that truth and the sword of the Spirit which is the Word
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   of God?
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.300]   Isn't this a tautology?
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.860]   Isn't he just saying the same thing again?
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.860]   Well no, he isn't.
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.380]   The difference I think is this.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:33.140]   When he says that we have to have our lines girt about with truth, he is referring to
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:41.140]   the central truth of salvation, the great way and plan and scheme of salvation as a
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.140]   whole.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.220]   But I don't think that's what he means here.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:49.300]   I think what he means here in particular is this.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.380]   When he says the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God, he is referring to our
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:58.340]   detailed knowledge of it.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:04.500]   I mean by that our knowledge of particular scriptures and our ability to pick out and
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.900]   to select and to use the appropriate scripture at any given point.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.340]   You see, the picture is of the enemy advancing and I take up the sword.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:18.100]   In other words, it's all there in the account of our Lord's temptation.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.500]   Here comes the enemy with his three different suggestions.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.780]   And did you notice how our Lord knew exactly which scripture to pick out, which one to
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.820]   extract, which one to use, which one to apply in that particular case?
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:35.660]   And so, by using the sword in this way with his particular answer from the scripture,
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.620]   he repels the enemy and causes him to disappear for the time being.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:45.420]   Now that I believe is the difference between these two things.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:50.860]   In other words, if we are to conquer as our Lord conquered, we must not only know the
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:58.460]   way of salvation and know that we are saved, we must know our scriptures.
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:02.820]   We must know them in this detailed manner.
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:12.460]   And not only that, we must learn how to use our scriptures, how to have just the very
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.460]   word we need to quote when somebody says something to us.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:24.300]   I mustn't keep you, but this is something which any well-trained Christian must know
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.020]   very well in his own experience, both negatively and positively.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.580]   I've seen people having discussions about this matter.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:35.740]   I've seen people trying to help an unbeliever and the unbeliever says something.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:41.900]   And then the Christian says, "You know, it says somewhere in the Bible this, that, and
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.020]   the other," which is a direct answer.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.260]   And then the unbeliever says, "Are you sure that's in the Bible?"
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:51.640]   And he says, "Well, I know it's here somewhere, but he doesn't know where it is."
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.060]   And you see how he fails.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.020]   The unbeliever says, "Well, there it is.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.020]   You can't prove to me that it is in the scripture."
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:00.660]   And he can't, of course, because he doesn't know where it is.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.260]   But on the other hand, if you can say, "Now, wait a minute.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.260]   Come here.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.260]   Look at this."
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.060]   He's made to listen.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.460]   It doesn't mean that of necessity you can persuade him to believe it, but at any rate
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.900]   he's got his scripture.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:18.500]   And you'll find this, that the unbeliever is generally very ignorant of the scriptures.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.700]   That's why he very largely is an unbeliever.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.860]   He's reading philosophy.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:22.940]   He's reading science.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.260]   He's reading the newspapers.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.880]   He's reading the attacks upon the scripture.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.200]   He doesn't know his scriptures.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.500]   And the best way of dealing with him is to say, "Now, come along and show him the thing."
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.900]   Then if he says this, you answer with that.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.300]   That's what the sword does.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:43.080]   It isn't a description of the general knowledge of the way of salvation, but it is this ability
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:48.860]   to bring out your scriptures, the appropriate answer, just the word at this very point,
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.140]   as our Lord did in his temptation.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.020]   Very well, my friends.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.660]   The sword is provided for us.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.420]   We've got an open Bible, but we must know it.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.540]   We must know the whole of it.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:08.700]   I'm not standing here to say you just learn a certain few proof texts.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.060]   No, no, you must know your whole scripture.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.460]   Look how our Lord quoted the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.400]   He obviously knew the whole book.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.540]   We must be soaked in it.
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:17.540]   We must know it.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:21.500]   We must have it at our fingertips, as it were, so that when something said, "The word comes,
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.800]   the Spirit will give you, he'll lead you to the word," and you'll quote your scripture.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.260]   It is the sword of the Spirit.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.540]   He's given it all.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.860]   He enlightens us.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.380]   He'll lead us and guide us.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:38.540]   And there he'll bring it into the memory, and we will be able to speak it.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:46.700]   But it does mean, I say, that we take up this sword of the Spirit, and that we don't contend
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:51.060]   ourselves with just reading a few verses and feel we've read our daily portion, and we
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.420]   are studying the scriptures.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.620]   No, no.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.100]   We must give time to it.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.100]   We must get down to the depths of it.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.820]   We must read the whole of the Bible, cover to cover.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:09.360]   Be really steeped in the knowledge of this truth, so that at any given moment, at any
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.780]   given point, we will know the word.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.820]   We'll have the appropriate answer.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.780]   The enemy will not only be repelled, he'll be discomfited.
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.780]   He'll flee from us.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.300]   He'll have to leave us alone for the moment.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:32.260]   And this is to me the most wonderful thing of all, that you can do all this, however
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.180]   humble your position and status in life may be.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:43.380]   I've known many a workman without much education, but who knew his Bible.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:50.740]   I've seen many times such a man make a very learned man look very foolish indeed.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:57.140]   The clever man from the university was trying to make fun of a poor road man working by
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:03.260]   the roadside with his knowledge and his learning, trying to shake the humble Christian.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.500]   But he couldn't do it.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.500]   The humble Christian knew his scriptures.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.300]   He knew the word of God.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:17.480]   And it was he who was enabled in that way to make the great learned men look the fool
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.020]   and walk away discomfited.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.020]   No, no.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:24.140]   This is not a matter of natural ability or learning or knowledge.
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.180]   God provides it.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.620]   And the Spirit is offered, is given.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:34.140]   And if he's upon you and in you, as you read the word, he'll fix it in your mind and heart,
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:38.060]   and he'll show you how to use it as the occasion arises.
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.060]   Very well, my friends.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:48.340]   We are living in desperate days when the enemy is trying to undermine the whole position.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:49:00.020]   Take up, take unto you the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:07.340]   Thank God for this book, this divinely inspired word of God.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.380]   It's not a book that contains the word of God.
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.420]   It is the word of God.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:21.180]   Let's realize that and use it and wield it to his glory and to his praise.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:27.180]   Amen.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:32.220]   The closing hymn is hymn number 505, 505.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.940]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.940]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.860]   505.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:44.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:45.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:46.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:48.860]   505.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:50:07.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:35.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:51:04.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:05.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.860]   505.
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:11.860]   505.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:12.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:13.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:16.860]   505.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:20.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:21.860]   505.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:22.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:25.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.860]   505.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:27.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:29.860]   Thou art in the midst of foes.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:30.860]   Watch and pray.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:31.860]   505.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.860]   Christian, seek not yet repose.
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:33.860]   Cast thy dreams of ease away.
