[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060]   I just, I got to tell you about what happened to me when I got back from my nearly month up in
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.020]   New England. You know, and our listeners know that I'm a fan of metrics. My time block planner even
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.220]   has a space on it for recording daily metrics. So when I got back from New England, I said,
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.460]   what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a new set of metrics all ready to go for the fall season
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.040]   that's coming up. Let's go. What's important in my life? What am I focusing on? What are my goals?
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.120]   I wrote out the metrics. I printed them out. I taped them. I kid you not. I taped them under the
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.140]   cover of my time block planner so I could measure those every night and I got into it. And Jesse,
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.000]   here's what happened. I promptly failed and I failed hard, right? Like, you know, Jesse knows I've been
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   telling him I've had a super busy week coming back from New England. A lot of things scheduled. I'm
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.620]   doing something like three to four interviews or talks. Some of them I'm giving, some of them on the
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.240]   other side of. I was giving lectures, we're podcasting, all sorts of stuff going on. Super busy
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.300]   time. And I was getting there at the end of each night to write down the metrics of what I did that
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.080]   day. And I was having one I could write down or maybe just like two that I could write down. I mean,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.760]   I wasn't getting anywhere near making the progress on the stuff that my metrics would have me make
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.320]   progress on. Last night, I finally just gave up and I actually wrote this stress default. I was like,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.800]   I'm not even going to bother writing one metric. It's too depressing. I'm stressed out about this.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.700]   I'm making progress on nothing. I'm declaring bankruptcy. I'm not even going to write down
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.540]   any metrics. So this is what I want to talk about today. The joys and sorrows of tracking metrics in
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.060]   your life. So I want to remind us like why I think metrics are important. I want to talk about what goes
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.540]   wrong with metrics, including what went wrong with me. And then I want to talk about in the third act,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.820]   how to handle metrics smarter, which will include how I ended up actually responding to my heart
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.840]   failure this week and sort of fixing my metric practice. All right. So that is our goal. Today,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   we're talking metrics. We'll start with act one, the promise of metrics. All right. So we got to get
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640]   into it. If you're not a longtime listener, you might be wondering, what does he really mean by metrics?
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.240]   It's a good question. These can mean multiple different things. So if a lot of people like the
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.280]   quantified life type people out there for them, metrics mean just gathering data about your day
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.040]   that you will then later look back at for trends. All right. So health type stuff, health biomarkers,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.360]   maybe wear a whoop strap and whatever you do, you're going to collect this data and you're going to look
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.480]   at it for trends. It doesn't have to be health. Jesse, remember we had David DeWayne on, what was that
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.700]   like a couple of months ago? Yeah. And he talked about, he was tracking every day, just how happy he was,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.580]   like how good of a day it is. So that's what some people think about with metrics, right? It's not
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.780]   what I mean. When I talk about metrics, what I mean about is short little coded sequences of letters
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.340]   that you use to track whether or not you did certain things or to what degree you did them. So it's not
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.340]   gathering data to analyze, it's tracking action. So here are some sample metrics. These are of the
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.900]   binary nature. You either did them or not. I exercised or not. I stretched or not. I spent
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.860]   one-on-one time with, you know, one of my kids today or not. I practiced my guitar, right? Those
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.740]   are sample things you could have metrics for. It's things you either did or you didn't, and you have
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.260]   something you can write down to indicate that you did. Some metrics are quantitative. So it's not just
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.160]   did I do it or not, but to what degree. So for example, a step count, here's how many steps I took
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.680]   today where you presumably maybe have some sort of minimum you're hoping to beat. Maybe the number
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.360]   of pages you read in a book is something else you might track. So it's not just that I read or not,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.500]   but how much did I read? And maybe you have a goal of how much reading you want to try to get to most
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.440]   nights, but maybe sometimes you even go farther. The goal with this style of metrics is to stay on
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.640]   track with the things that you care about, all right? Because this is a problem I think we face
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.100]   with time management and organization that it's a, it's possible that you're super on the ball with
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.760]   your, your, your organizational tactics, right? You're multi-scale planning. Uh, you look at your
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.100]   week, you're fitting in your work, your time block plan, your intention about your time. You have
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.840]   shut down rituals. You're, you're tracking and organizing your tasks very carefully in full capture
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.220]   based task management systems. You are doing a lot of stuff and you're getting a lot of stuff done,
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.760]   but it's possible that the things you were doing, though, making you very busy are not actually
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.880]   moving you closer to your definition of the deep life. You're doing stuff, but not the stuff that
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.160]   matters. This is where metrics can be very helpful because you run whatever time management organizational
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.080]   systems you want. But at the end of the day, you said, did I make progress on the things that really
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.140]   matter to me? And knowing that you'll be recording this day after day really influences the way that you
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.880]   go about your day. And you start putting aside time. This is the theory. You start putting aside time for
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.820]   these things to make sure that you can mark it off on your metric tracking. It's a way of
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.580]   continually nudging your activity towards things that matter. This was a big breakthrough for me
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.180]   when my own practices, I got very organized. I've long been very organized. I'm good at managing my
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.620]   time. I'm good at keeping up at work and seeing what's due when and making sure that I started early
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.900]   enough. But I was falling behind. I found this in my life. I was falling behind on things. I mattered.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.620]   I'm not reading as much as I should be reading. I'm not spending time with these people that's
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.780]   important to me. I'm not spending enough time with them. I'm not prioritizing this. I'm busy,
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.140]   but not doing the things that matter. Metrics made a big difference to me. That's why I include them
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.220]   in my time block planner. I talk about them in multiple of my books. I've talked about them.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.600]   So that's what I talk about when I'm talking about metrics. So again, you would have for each of
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.940]   these things a short code. So did I exercise or not? If I did, I write down EX in the metric tracking
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.280]   block, my time block planner. Do I stretch? If I did, maybe I'll write STR. That's my code.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:59.380]   One-on-one time with kid, kid. Step count, S colon number for step count, right? And I actually will,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.340]   this is what I said earlier and I was like, oh, I planned out my metrics for the fall. I actually have
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.300]   those codes written out. I tape them on my planner. Here's the codes I'm using to keep track of this
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.180]   stuff. So it's a good idea. I think if you care about the deep life and not just being productive,
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.560]   it matters. But I failed. I had a really hard week and I sort of gave up temporarily on my metrics.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:30.140]   Why did I fail? This brings us to act two when metrics go awry. So there's four main problems
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:37.480]   people have with my style of activity tracking metrics. There's one big one, which I think is
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.700]   the most important. It's the one that really I had issues with. I'll do that one last. Let me get with
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.560]   the three smaller ones first, because these also pop up a lot as well. Vagueness is a big issue with
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.660]   metric tracking, right? You have a thing you're tracking with a metric that is so vague that either
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.180]   everything counts or nothing counts. It could be either thing. Like, for example, you might've
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:05.580]   written down, like, I connect with my daughter. I mean, what does that mean? What does it take to
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.140]   actually write down the code for that on your daily metric tracking? Does it count if you high-fived her
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.500]   in the hallway? Or does it require, like, you went to a father-daughter dance and, you know, shared a
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.320]   milkshake in a heartfelt conversation before you allowed the market down? It's too vague. That's not
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.500]   specific enough. So that's a problem a lot of people have is they're too vague. And then they're
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.720]   like, I don't even know what, I can either put this metric down every day. I never put it down. I don't
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.920]   know. And you kind of give up on it. The other side is it's specific, but it's impossible that you just
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   put something down that it's not really something that on an average day you're likely to get to.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.680]   You put down like, yeah, I would bike a hundred miles a day. That'd be great. And you're like,
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.320]   oh, that takes a long time. It takes many hours to bike a hundred hours. I don't normally have enough
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.020]   time to bike a hundred miles every day. This is basically an almost always impossible to achieve
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.320]   metric, right? So you're unrealistic in the difficulty or time consumption of a singular metric. That's
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.340]   another big problem. Spreadsheet syndrome is a third one. Then instead of just having a simple code you
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.940]   jot down, like in something like a time block planner, you start putting into the spreadsheets.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.360]   We know these type of people. I got to put the data into the whatever so that I can have the pie chart
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.000]   and the pie chart is going to dynamically alter and it's going to be really nicely color coded.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.500]   I made it a 3D pie chart and I adjusted what the drop shadow is. So it looks really good. And I'm looking
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.520]   for the pie chart to change. That's all friction. And it's going to eventually get annoying enough that
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.220]   it's been a hard day and you're tired and you don't want to open up Microsoft Excel for 15 minutes
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.740]   and you stop metric tracking. That's why I'm a big fan. And you should just have some couple letters.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.960]   You jot them down, takes 10 seconds and your metric tracking is done. So spreadsheet syndrome is another
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:52.100]   problem. But the biggest problem of all with metric tracking practices, and this is what really stung me
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:09:00.880]   this week. Going with an inventory of what's important to you as opposed to a realistic plan for what you want to do
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.280]   on a regular basis. These are not the same thing. So if you sit down, you say, okay, I want to list out what's
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.160]   important to me. And then I'll have a metric related to each of those things. Now you don't want to leave things
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.120]   out. I'm trying to list things that are important to you. They're like, well, I don't want to leave this part of my life
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.680]   It's important to me. That better be on the list. Otherwise I'm signaling to myself. It's not. Well, this thing
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.680]   over here is very important to me. I should put that on the list too. I need a metric for that. And before you
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.860]   know it, your list of metrics you're tracking is an inventory of everything that's important to you.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:39.360]   And the possibility for you to actually make progress on that many things on a regular basis is basically
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.640]   impossible. It's just too many things you want to make progress on. That's what happened to me. I went
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.520]   through an exercise when I was up in New England where I checked back in as I do most summers after
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.720]   my birthday about what are the areas of my life that are important to me? What am I trying to do with
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.100]   them right now? And I listed out all these different areas. There are six different areas. I ended up with
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.380]   actually many more than six metrics because I had at least one metric for each of those six areas,
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.940]   but for the one related to health, I actually track four metrics for my health. It's exercise,
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:14.160]   stretching, step count, and then there's like a food and diet sort of like quality of the food I eat
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:21.540]   sort of thing. So it's 10 metrics. It was just too many. I mean, I've been busy. I had a busy calendar
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.380]   and I was like, I can't make progress on 10 things. In fact, I could do maybe one or two of these things
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:32.080]   maybe. And I was super stressed having so many things I wasn't writing down because what I had
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.860]   really done was inventory to everything that was important to me, as opposed to saying, here is a
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.820]   reasonable mix of things I could make progress on on most days that would be important to me.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.580]   So that's probably the number one problem. It was my problem as well.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.260]   So how do we fix this? What's a smarter way to approach activity tracking metrics? Well, that brings
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:11:01.280]   us to act three, making metrics work. There are four things that I did to help clean up my metric
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.460]   track. I did this last night. I wrote this all out after I get the stress default. I was like, okay,
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:12.300]   I got to fix this. And these, I think are the main four tools you have to make activity-based metric
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:19.520]   tracking actually be sustainable. Number one, you can consider doing multiple choice metrics.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.760]   So what that means is you have multiple things that are important to you, but it's unreasonable
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.740]   perhaps to make progress on all of those things every day. It would be a real laundry list. What you do
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.720]   instead is you have a multiple choice approach to it where you might say, for example, here's five
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.260]   things that are important to me. I have a metric code for each. I want to try to do one of these
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:47.180]   per day. So my goal is each day to write down one of these metric codes. If I can get to like one of
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.520]   these things each day, get a little bit of effort, I'll consider that a success. So now you're getting
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.220]   more reasonable. You can have more areas you care about, but you're not trying to unreasonably make
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:02.240]   progress on everything every day. Autopilot scheduling makes a huge difference as well.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.120]   So many different metrics. If you're going to succeed in actually doing that activity every day,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.020]   it has to be integrated to your schedule in a way that you don't have to think about it.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:17.780]   We're using this with exercise. This is how I handle exercise. When we're in out of the summer and during
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.000]   a normal semester, I know when I do my exercise. My wife knows when I do my exercise. It's part of my
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.220]   schedule. This is just when I do my exercise. So it's a regular part of my schedule. It's what we
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.080]   call autopilot scheduling. That makes sure it gets done. If I instead just started each day and said,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:38.700]   I'm going to try to find time, 45 minutes at some point today to exercise, what's my hit rate going to
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:44.780]   be? 20% of days, I happen to have enough time and enough energy to do it. So the more things you can
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:50.820]   actually find a regular time and day to do it, so an autopilot schedule, the more successful that'll be.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.180]   So your metrics should have a lot of autopilot scheduling going on. You really shouldn't have
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:02.380]   four or five things that you want to make progress on every day that have no fixed time that you always
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.480]   do when you schedule. No, like I meditate when I first wake up, I work out right before dinner. You do not
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.580]   want a lot of things that aren't autopiloted scheduled. The third thing to do to make metrics work
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:19.800]   is to eliminate, combine, and simplify it. Just say, hey, look, there's a lot of things. I can't work on all of
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.540]   these things. I want a good sampling of things that matter to me that I want to do regularly.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.700]   And the other stuff, you know, I will try to make progress on it at maybe a bigger time scale. If
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.800]   you're a multi-scale planner, you can make progress on it like at the strategic plan schedule or the
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.000]   weekly scale. Like, you know, hey, do I have a day today that I could go like see my brother who lives
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.440]   nearby and we can like get together and have lunch? Like, okay, I do this week. I didn't last week,
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.800]   but I do this week, right? Then maybe that's the right scale to be working on that thing that's
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.820]   important to you. So you might want to simplify or eliminate the stuff that you really are trying
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.740]   to track every day. That doesn't have to be everything that's important to you. Doesn't
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:02.880]   have to have progress made at that scale. Combining means you might find a way to make progress on
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:12.040]   multiple things to report it in one step, right? It's like walking my dog also gets me steps and I
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.780]   always call my mom when I do it, right? And now you're, you have like one activity that's handling
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.740]   multiple steps or you want to have like a hobby that's important to you, but you want to spend time
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.400]   with your kids. Oh, why don't we come up with something that I do with my kids? It's like a joint
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.980]   hobby. So you can do combining as well. The final thing is probably the most important is
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:37.920]   go sequential and slow down. Like I can't do all these things at the same time. Okay. I mean, I want
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.440]   to hypothetically like learn to play guitar and I want to speak Spanish and I want to learn how to program
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.900]   a computer and like these three things I think would make my life richer. To try to make progress on all
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.100]   three of those things every day is crazy. To even try to do multiple choice on those three things is kind
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.920]   of crazy. Like, well, I want to work on one of these each day and you're switching back and forth
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.900]   between these things. It's, you know, this is, this could be like way overkill. So maybe what you stay
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.440]   instead is like, let's just slow down. That's a slow productivity tactic. I'm working on Spanish right
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:12.980]   now. I'm just going to do that for the next four months or six months. And when I feel like I got to
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.820]   a good place, then maybe I'll have a season I'm working on, like trying to learn some guitar and we'll see
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:22.060]   how that goes. Programming, I don't know, maybe next year. It's interesting, but let's just push that off.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.520]   Take your time. Life is long. Sequential. I'll do this when it's done. I'll work on something else.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:35.180]   So not trying to necessarily have everything that's important to you be active all at the same time.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.460]   All right. So that's basically what I've done. My new metrics, I have a big multiple choice
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:46.380]   that makes things much simpler. I eliminated some things that I was tracking. I'm going sequential on
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.140]   some other things like, okay, let me just work on this. Now this other thing I'll work on in a different
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:57.320]   season. I moderated Jesse. I was, my goal was to spend about 30 hours a week on my Halloween
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.280]   decorations and I moderated. That's now 27 and a half hours a week because 30 hours was just a
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.760]   little bit too much. So 27 and a half hours a week on my Halloween decorations. But there we go. So
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.620]   metrics are important. The right type of metrics. It really helps make sure that you're not just
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:18.040]   organized, but you're organized towards stuff that matters. But don't beat yourself up if you struggle
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.580]   with metrics because I kind of like invented this approach and I still completely screwed up
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.120]   last week. And then I had to remember my own medicine. All right, let's get reasonable here.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.760]   It's a process. And also, hey, the fact that I had turned these off while I was away, like that also
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.540]   is a thing. I was on, I was up in New England for a month. It's like, I don't want to track metrics
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.860]   every day. I come and I go, right? Like this is all real talk. It's a useful tool. You're not running all
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.980]   the time. You're going to get it wrong. And it's something that you keep working on over time. So
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.860]   hopefully you have some sort of metric tracking going, but you're not being too hard on yourself
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:54.140]   about getting it just right or having a Herculean collection of metrics that you're trying to do.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.060]   So there you go. People ask about metrics, I think. They don't always quite know what I'm talking about.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.580]   And then you should probably explain what the time block planner is.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.480]   Well, if you don't know that, then I don't want to know you. I actually have a planner. I think we
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:13.400]   created this during the pandemic. You can buy at Amazon or wherever books are sold online for doing
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   time blocking. And it has the pre-formatted pages for time blocking, for capture, and for metric
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:26.320]   tracking. It also has a shutdown complete checkbox. You can do it. It's worth buying even for just the
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.260]   introduction. I mean, I have an extensive introduction in the planner where I explain all my philosophies for
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.780]   how I manage my time using this. So you, it's actually like a mini Cal Newport time management
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.760]   book, plus the tool to do it. So you should check that out. There's a website as well with a video.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.380]   Yeah. If you've got a timeblockplanner.com, we filmed a nice video. That was with a nice camera too.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:53.480]   It was Rob's overhead. Use the fancy camera. I enjoyed that. So there you go. Metrics. All right.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.820]   We got some good questions coming up, but Jesse, you know what we got to do now? I think we got to do some ads.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.660]   Let's do some music for the ads. Let's get into it. That's what I'm thinking today. We're in a
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.240]   musical mode. Oh, there we go. There we go. Does that put you in an ad mood, Jesse?
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   It does. I got to tell you a true story then, Jesse, because this has got me thinking about ads.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.440]   This is true. I keep finding in our front yard, in our front bush, this same orange color cat that's
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.980]   hanging around. It's a beautiful cat, like a ginger colored cat. I don't know whose it is, but it kind of
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.940]   hangs out around our house, especially in the afternoon. It made me miss having cats. When we
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.900]   grew up, we had two Siamese cats. Their names were Singha and Nitnoy. Those are Thai names. My mom lived
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.320]   in Bangkok for a while and they were great cats. I really liked having cats. We don't have them now
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:45.160]   because my wife is allergic to cats. We don't have cats in the house, but seeing that cat in my yard
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:51.300]   got me a little nostalgic and it led me to do, which I think is probably like the only natural
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:57.700]   response to this situation, Jesse was I divorced my wife. All right. Not really, but all this cat
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:04.580]   talk got me thinking about one of today's sponsors, Small's Cat Food. This is the cat food I wish I had
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:10.860]   back when we had cats and I would recommend it to anyone who does. Small's Cat Food is protein packed.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.080]   It's made with preservative-free ingredients that you'd find in your fridge, like good ingredients.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.120]   It's delivered right to your door. That's why cats.com names Small's their best overall cat food.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.300]   You can get 60% off your first order and free shipping if you go to smalls.com slash deep,
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.720]   but that's only for a limited time only. Don't take my word for it. Here is a real review from a real
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.920]   customer. Jennifer M said, after every feeding, he gets this burst of energy and starts running around the
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.860]   house. My cat does too. Kind of a joke, Jesse. It was like she was talking about her husband or
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.520]   something like that. And his fur is softer and more vibrant with higher contrast. Same with my cats.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.220]   See what I'm doing there? I'm kind of like riffing, like she's talking about her husband,
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.840]   but really it's about her cat. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend anything else. You know what else I like
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.640]   about Small's? This is me now, not Jennifer M. They work with the Humane World for Animals. They've
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.360]   donated over a million dollars worth of food to help cats through the Humane World for Animals. And they
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.920]   even give you a chance to donate at checkout. You know what I don't like about them? They rejected
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.020]   my slogan idea, which was cat food so good, you'll want to divorce your wife so you can buy a cat.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.840]   They didn't like that one. I think that would be a catchy, catchy slogan. Anyways, what are you
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.200]   waiting for? Give your cat the food they deserve for a limited time only because you are a Deep
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:32.060]   Questions listener. You get 60% off your first Small's order plus free shipping when you head to
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:38.720]   smalls.com slash deep. That's 60% off when you head to smalls.com slash deep plus free shipping. Again,
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:47.260]   that's smalls.com slash deep. Jesse, I also got to talk about our friends at Vanta. In today's fast
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.680]   changing digital world, proving your company is trustworthy isn't just important for growth. It is
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:21:01.580]   essential. That's why Vanta is here. Here's the thing. Running a company today that basically has, I don't know,
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.000]   anything to do with technology is going to eventually require you to be compliant with various
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.020]   standards. This can be a huge pain and take up a lot of time that you should be spending on making
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:17.460]   your business better. This is where Vanta enters the scene and makes this all easier. So whether
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:24.960]   you're a startup tackling your first SOC 2 or ISO 27001 or an enterprise managing vendor risk, Vanta's
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:31.020]   trust management platform makes it quicker, easier, and more scalable. I'll tell you, and Jesse will tell you
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:38.040]   this is true. I pitched him a podcast episode idea where I said, look, let's do like an hour 50 where
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:44.680]   I riff on ISO 27001. And you know what Jesse said? And he was right. Let Vanta handle that. And he was
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:50.700]   right about that. We shouldn't be thinking about that. Vanta should for us. I mean, I fired him because
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:56.120]   no one says no to me, but it was a good idea. Vanta is who should be dealing with these issues for you.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.780]   You shouldn't be thinking more about them than you have to. Vanta also helps you complete security
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:05.500]   questionnaires up to five times faster. So you win bigger deals sooner. The results, according to a
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:12.960]   recent IDC study, Vanta customers slash over $500,000 a year in cost, and they're three times more
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:19.100]   productive. Establishing trust is an optional. Vanta makes it automatic. So visit Vanta.com slash

[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.240]   All right, let's do some questions of our own.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:40.880]   All right. First question is from Luis. When looking to make a change in your career, how do you deal with
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.620]   that gray area where you have some career capital and the target job, but it's still difficult to decide
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:51.540]   if now is the right time to move? Well, part of this, Luis, is not to think about a career change in the
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:59.900]   abstract or as a self-justified move. Hey, do I do a career change or not? Abstractly speaking, a career
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:06.940]   change is an action you make to serve a particular goal, which is to move your life closer to your ideal
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:13.960]   lifestyle. A career change should do so either, here's the justifications, it does so either in
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.920]   like a really demonstrable way. Hey, I make significant progress towards my ideal lifestyle
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.220]   with this career change. If it's just like nibbling around the edges, it might not be worth it. That's
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:27.720]   motivation number one for a career change. Or motivation number two is there's things about
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.940]   this job that like really clash with me, my values, or is making me unhappy. And so this is just about
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.500]   the piece of my ideal lifestyle where I'm not miserable every day. That's why you would do a
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:42.640]   career change. So what matters then, if you have a career change in mind that is going to either get
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.680]   you out of a bad situation or move you demonstrably closer to your ideal lifestyle, the only thing that
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:53.320]   matters is, do I have enough career capital to make this likely to succeed? And that's it. If you think
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.000]   you do, you go for it. And if you're not sure, then you build up more career capital until it's sure.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.000]   Right. And that's it. Like you don't have to identify some sort of mythical exact threshold
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.740]   at exactly this point I should do it or at this point I shouldn't. It's like, if it's a good idea
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.700]   and it's a good idea for those reasons I talked about, if you're confident you have enough career
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.500]   capital, go for it. If you're not sure, do more work until you're confident. Build up rare and
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.320]   valuable skills until it's like more demonstrably clear that you'll succeed. Now, if you want to know
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.480]   if you have enough career capital, we talk about this all the time. I think my book's so good
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.540]   they can't ignore you gets into this the most specifically, but use money as a neutral indicator of
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:32.460]   value. Is there a job offer on the table for this new job or someone is willing to hire and pay me?
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.400]   If not, then maybe you don't have the capital to make that turn. Don't quit. And then start going
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.020]   job searching and hope it works out. If you're going to start your own thing, start it on the side.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:48.420]   Are people giving me money for it? If not, maybe I'm not ready. Right. So don't just jump out there
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.840]   in the world to try to harvest a temporary, the temporary lift you get from making a change and
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.380]   then say, I'll figure out, get started with what comes next. Do your work, get evidence you have
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.900]   enough career capital. If you do go for it. If you don't, don't. And if it's not a home run,
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.400]   then maybe you don't need a career change. There might be other ways for you to get closer to your
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.500]   ideal lifestyle. What I'm trying to avoid here, Jesse, is sometimes people just like the idea of the
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.780]   temporary high they get from making a change. It's like, I want to make a change. Can I make
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:21.900]   a change yet? I always ask why? What is the change for? You need a reason for your change to sort of
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.000]   harvest the sustainable value out of it. All right. Who do we got next?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.600]   Next up is Craig. Do you have a framework or approach for developing deep, critical thinking,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.720]   particular for young people? I'm a father of young children and also a mentor of a group of young men,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.300]   and I want to help them build the habit of thinking deeply. Well, there's a, there's a known formula
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:52.260]   that's been around for millennia. It's reading, writing. So reading builds new circuits in your brain.
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.320]   I've been working on this topic for a chapter in my, the book I'm working on about the deep life.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.420]   Reading builds what are known as deep reading processes. The more reading you do of like hard
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.200]   stuff or stuff that challenges you literally builds new connections between parts of your brain.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.460]   It gives you a different brain. It upgrades your brain from what we could think of as the
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.620]   pragmatic brain that we evolved for, that's well-suited for living in small bands in the
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:20.380]   Paleolithic to what we can call the symbolic brain. That is a brain that can do a lot more things. So
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.800]   you got to keep it, keep in mind, reading is artificial, right? It's not something we evolved
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.280]   to do. It was invented relatively recently. And so it takes hard work, but if you do reading of things
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.500]   that are hard, it literally changes your brain and you go from pragmatic to symbolic and that brain,
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:40.900]   it sees the world in technicolor. The ideas, the way you can process information, the things you notice,
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:46.140]   the opportunities, the gratitude and interest you can find in the world. So much stuff, your ability to
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:51.760]   navigate economically, the get ahead, so much comes out of having a well-honed symbolic brain.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:57.540]   Reading is a foundational activity to do that. Reading, reading, reading, that's everything. Like,
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.180]   I'm not very good at being a tiger parent. I'm not very good at, hey, you got to get A's on
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.340]   everything and do a hundred activities. But there's one thing that I'm super, super clear on with my
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:12.720]   kids, reading, right? I've made them all readers. It's hard work, but I was like, that is, that's it.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.100]   That's like being in good shape. If you live in ancient Sparta, everything else will be okay.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.220]   You'll figure it out, but you better be a reader. Writing helps as well. So I think about reading
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:27.200]   establishes the circuits. It changes your brain. Writing is how you practice applying that new
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:32.560]   brain. So reading gives you a more sophisticated brain. Writing is how you practice putting that
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.620]   brain to work. It forces you to have to try to take thoughts and organize them in a way that then you
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:43.860]   assess to be logical. So writing gets you good at using what you develop through the readings. You
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:50.360]   kind of need both. If you write a lot, but don't read a lot, you're working with a lot less resources.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.560]   So what you can produce is reduced. If you read a lot and don't write a lot, you might have built this
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.380]   really sophisticated brain, but when it comes time to think critically or use it, or I'm going to come
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.220]   make an argument or try to come up with a strategy, you're like, oh, I'm struggling to actually harness
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:10.860]   this thing and pull together my thoughts into something that is reasonable and coherent. Now, there's some
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:16.120]   specific types of training you can do as well. I've been working on these for my new book, some of these.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:22.440]   Rhetoric helps. Like, hey, young man, you're talking about you mentor young men. I want you
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:29.560]   to like make a case for this. Gather information, put it into a coherent argument that doesn't have
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:36.600]   holes, make your case, react to counter arguments, like just practice making an argument. That's very
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.640]   helpful. Dialectical reading is very helpful as well. It's a fancy name for a simple idea, which is
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:46.400]   I'm going to take a topic that I care about that there's debate about. I'm going to read a really
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.960]   good book that's making a case for one side of this topic, and then I'm going to read another really
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:54.700]   good book that's making a case on the other side. Good case, good case. I'm not interested in this
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.240]   tribal thing of like, what do we believe? That's all I want to hear about, and anyone on the other side
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:06.100]   obviously has a brain virus and is probably like a week away from being a zombie and, you know, 28 days
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.480]   later. No, I want to hear arguments that are really good on both sides. Why? Because when good
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.700]   arguments clash, this was Socrates' idea, the root that grows down, it's a taproot of understanding.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.360]   You become a much smarter understanding of what's going on. It's not going to trick you out of your
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.920]   beliefs. It's going to make you a much more sophisticated thinker. Dialectical reading
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.640]   matters, and then primary, secondary source reading. This is a good way to increase the sophistication of
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:35.160]   what you're reading. Really sophisticated books can be hard to jump into. If I just say like, here is
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.700]   some Heidegger, go to town, you're going to read it for a while and be like, I have no idea what those
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.040]   words meant. But if you read some secondary sources about Heidegger, who was he? What was
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.580]   his ideas? What's he arguing in this book? This language is weird. It's different. It's kind of
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.880]   mythological. Like, what's going on here? Oh, I see what he's doing here. Now I'm going to read Heidegger.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:56.300]   Suddenly you have, it's like you couldn't really see the words, and you put reading glasses on.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.340]   So it's a way to upgrade the level of challenge that you're able to handle,
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.300]   and that's going to upgrade again those deep reading circuits and upgrade your brain from
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:11.540]   pragmatic to symbolic. So Craig, I like what you're working on. And reading, writing, that's the key.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.420]   And then all these other things are just little glosses on types of reading or types of writing
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:21.060]   that you can do. But reading, writing, that is it in our modern world. The getting a brain that's going
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:29.040]   to help you thrive. All right. Who we got? Next up is David. I have four kids in K-12. These are my
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.820]   options for my job. Stay in my current role, which offers stability. Take an internal promotion with a
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:41.000]   dysfunctional team and toxic leadership or leave for a high-paced consulting firm. What should I do?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.300]   I don't know, Jesse. Did you get a sense that he has an answer that he thinks is right here?
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.640]   It's probably not. I should probably go to the dysfunctional team that has toxic leadership
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.920]   or let me go to the high-paced consulting firm. I think it's pretty clear. I think he knows what
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:00.640]   he wants to do. Current role stability. Like a push-pull. He described the other things so
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.340]   negatively. So I think you know what you want to do, David. That's fine. But let's go through like
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.000]   the bigger exercise of like, how do you make these type of decisions in general? Lifestyle-centric
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.380]   planning. You have your vision of your ideal lifestyle and you assess each of these options
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:22.520]   through that vision. So probably the dysfunction and toxicity of that second option, you're like,
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.100]   wow, that lifestyle is not very good. That doesn't really seem close to like my vision, like what my
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:32.020]   day is like, what my work is like. The high-paced consulting firm, like this is where lifestyle-centric
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.660]   planning might be a little bit more effective because it's tempting to jump to that just because it
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.880]   might be more prestigious and more money. Doesn't really matter. Like day-to-day, unless you're
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:49.020]   Scrooge McDuck, you're not like actually interacting with your money and there's not someone walking in
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:54.800]   front of you heralding the competitiveness of the job you have. What matters day-to-day for your overall
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:00.200]   satisfaction is the details of your lifestyle. What is my everyday like? And if you have this vision of
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.080]   this lifestyle where, you know, you're spending like a lot of time with your kids and like the family
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.640]   and you're like really into like athletic things and you're hiking trails in the land behind your
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:17.480]   house and you're spending 30 hours a week on Halloween decorations, you have this big vision
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.060]   of, you know, you're sitting at the picnic table with the extended family with the cafe lights hanging
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:27.720]   from the trees as the sun goes down. And then you say, okay, working an 80-hour-a-week job, is that
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.840]   going to be closer or farther? Like, oh man, that steps on so many parts of that vision.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.320]   So, uh, no, I'm not going to do that. But maybe this is not the situation. You're in a situation,
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.860]   like if you're somebody who didn't have a bunch of kids and you like want to be in the mix and you
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.100]   want to travel, you're like, I want to kind of like move around like the country and see things
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:51.120]   and have like a really cool apartment. And like, then high-paced consult, you're like, that's going
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.380]   to move me closer to these visions. Like I can't afford that on what I'm doing. That's going to get
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.960]   me closer. And I kind of like the lifestyle that leads to. So lifestyle-centric planning is how you make
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.300]   these decisions. In your case, David, I think you've already made up your mind. That's fine.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:06.560]   That's good. If that matches your lifestyle, just sounds like it does. And probably four kids make
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.880]   sense to me. Stable, not super high-paced, not dysfunctional, not stressful. I think it's a
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.760]   perfectly valid reason to stay with something because your lifestyle is ultimately what determines
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:22.140]   your day-to-day happiness, not these more abstract properties, like exactly what my salary is or how
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.900]   competitive my job was. People just don't care. All right, who we got?
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:31.940]   Next up is Omay. I've worked in a high-pressure call center for 11 years where I'm glued to the
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:37.780]   screen all day. I lack the traditional credentials, but want to switch fields to cybersecurity. Is it
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.920]   possible to make the switch?
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:45.320]   Well, I don't know because I'm not in the cybersecurity field, but you should know by talking to someone in
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   that field. Evidence, evidence, evidence. That's what matters. Talk to real people in that field, real
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:59.960]   talk, not hypothetical, not wishful thinking. What is needed to switch to these type of jobs, like this
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:05.060]   specific job here that you just hired for? What would something like me have to do to get that job? You ask
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.480]   that real question and get the real answer, and you might like the answer. It might be like, oh, like we have
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.880]   training on site, and this is what we're looking for, and like you could probably fit, or it could be like
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:20.520]   we're looking for at least two years of postdoctoral work on this, and like an H index of 30. And you're
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.900]   like, oh, that's never going to happen, so it's off the table. You might not like the answer, you might
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.700]   love the answer, but get the answer. The worst thing to do in this situation is to say, I don't want to
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:33.540]   confront the reality of what's required to make this switch I'm thinking about. I just want to go do
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:39.460]   something because the thing sounds interesting, and I want to harvest, like we talked about before,
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:45.760]   harvest the temporary contact high of change. And in this case, there's a lot of things out there that
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.520]   people will offer you like, oh, come do this. This might help you. You don't know if it matters at
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.980]   all. They're just going to kind of like throw it out to you. Like you might end up dropping 20k on some
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:02.380]   online-only cybersecurity master's program, which is like essentially like a three-card Monte game that has a
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:08.880]   lot more Zoom. Just taking your money. Thank you for your money. Don't just go do something. Just get
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.280]   the evidence. Talk to people in the field. Here are specific jobs you've hired for in the past. Look,
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.560]   I'm not trying to get a job from you now. I'm trying to learn. What would you look for in that job? What
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.860]   would I need to do to pass that, if anything? And just get the real answer. Confront that professional
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:29.080]   dragon, and then you work from there. That's how I became a book writer. Talked to an agent, said,
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:34.720]   I want to publish a book. I'm 21 years old. I was 20 when I talked to her. What would really be
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.540]   necessary for me to do this? And she gave me the real answer. She's like, yeah, like there's almost
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:43.740]   no way you can do this at your age. There is like this path or that path, or like the only two ways
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.340]   you could probably do this. And I looked at one of those two paths, like, great. Okay, now I know I'll
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.940]   do that. And I executed it. And that's why I got my foot in the door of publishing. So you confront the
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.620]   reality of a situation when it comes to career moves. Don't tell yourself a story and don't just start
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:02.140]   doing stuff that generally so much of like grad school is based off of like, I don't want to
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:07.480]   actually figure out what's needed for this job. This sounds like a thing that people do. Let me go
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.780]   do that. And what happens is like professors like me, just like, great, I'll just take that money.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:20.960]   And I don't know, buy fur coats. But mainly, mainly what happens with low value master's programs is
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.740]   it's professors buying fur coats. I don't know if that's well known. But that's actually what happens.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:32.740]   All right, we got one more. We got one more from Megan. I got laid off after a 15 year career. I'm
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:37.240]   now barred from entering this particular woodshed. I had a sense this was coming. Should I have left
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:42.120]   this job earlier? Or do you think I it was an acceptable and kind of like an athlete's career
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.820]   ending due to injury? I mean, Megan, I don't know. I don't know. And I don't know that it really
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:55.240]   matters. I mean, I want to validate that. I think this was rightly so emotionally taxing.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:01.140]   Like you were laid off, you're barred. It sounds like it was not a happy ending.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:08.140]   This sucks. Like it's going to feel really bad and it's okay to feel bad about it. You're going to feel
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.680]   literal chemicals when you think about it that are very negative. But I don't know that we need to
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.900]   ruminate on it. I don't think it's helpful to go back and, you know, Sunday morning quarterback
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.520]   or Monday morning quarterback. When is football played? September 6th, baby. But what's the
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.520]   expression? It must be Monday. Tonight is the Hall of Fame game. Okay. Preseason though. But what's
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.720]   the saying? It must be Monday morning quarterbacking because, yeah, football used to be played primarily
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:37.200]   on Sundays. But now it's played on basically every day, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, pretty much.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.480]   Thursday morning, Wednesday morning quarterbacking. There's still football played on Wednesday. Or is
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.440]   Wednesday games? Well, it depends on when Christmas is now. I think we need to spend the next 25 minutes
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.100]   getting into this. Because I think last year Christmas was on a Wednesday. To ESPN.com.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.860]   All right. So what I'm saying here is like, let's not ruminate on it. Let's look forward.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.300]   Let's accept it sucks. Let's accept you feel bad. But let's take our actual like rational,
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:05.040]   internalized voice and aim it at what comes next. And let's use some lifestyle centric planning.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:12.540]   Let's use some career capital. You know, first thing first is like, need a job. We need money.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.820]   Like, let's make sure that we're not like in financial trouble. And then let's step back and
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.920]   do some lifestyle centric planning. Here's the silver lining. There's a big change. What can you do in
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.380]   changes? You can lean into it and change other things in a way that's good. Okay. There's a big
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.660]   change situation. But hey, maybe this means I'm going to move somewhere else or take a different type of
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:34.980]   career. I got to move to, you know, a really low cat, a teeny house that I own, you know,
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.640]   in like the Oregon coast and like do this job remote that I already know about. It's not much money,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.820]   but I won't need much money. And then I'm going to work on this and I'm going to be near my, my uncle.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:48.180]   And it's going to be whatever. Like you're so many things you maybe wouldn't have done when you're in
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:52.260]   this other job, which sounds like if you knew it was coming, it was probably not a happy situation.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.360]   So let's not ruminate on what happened. Let's get excited about what could happen.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.020]   And that's lifestyle-centric planning and making evidence-based moves to get you closer to that
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:06.160]   lifestyle. I think you could end up being way better off. I'm talking like three years down the
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.680]   line, you're like, man, that was a really good thing to happen to me because like, look at my,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.640]   my situation now. I don't know if I sold the best vision there though, Jesse, living in a teeny house
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:20.520]   next to your uncle. That's like both hyper-specific and like not very compelling. But what if I told you
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.640]   your uncle was a wizard? See, then that would be much more cool. And he was going to teach you the
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.820]   ways of magic. One of my uncles kind of lives in a teeny house. Yeah. Pretty cool.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.000]   It's like, uh, because you could probably one of those like prefab houses. It's not teeny, but it's
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.120]   pretty small. You remember that movement? It was like a four-year period in the 2000s. I don't know if
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.840]   you were in on these blogs, but I was definitely in that world where building and buying a teeny
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:52.300]   house was like a big deal. Remember that? Because it was, it was, uh, roughly $15,000. Like what it would
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.040]   roughly cost to get the materials. You would build it on a trailer. And like, the idea was, it was like
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:01.900]   a lot of millennials who were like coming through their twenties and it was a hard job market because
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:09.840]   of the, the financial crisis. And the idea was like, oh, I could just own this. Like no, uh, no mortgage,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.280]   you know, no like expensive apartment. I could just like own my house. 50, I could raise $15,000.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.860]   It's like I could save. And, uh, and so that became popular for a while. So you have your teeny
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.760]   house. The problem was when you live in a teeny house, you're also always like three feet from
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.380]   a toilet. And I think that's what probably killed the romance of it is like, you would get in there
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:34.120]   with your like boyfriend or whatever and be like, we have embarked on this mystical, beautiful journey
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:40.160]   of minimalism. Uh, and then your boyfriend is like, yeah, hold on a second. Uh, my, my lunch isn't
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:45.840]   agreeing with me, walks two feet away from you and shuts that little curtain. The magic goes away at
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:54.940]   that point. The magic, that's where it's no longer like, uh, you're in like a, the hut and outlander
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.160]   and it's looking over the moors. It, it becomes real. So I think that's why the mini house idea,
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.320]   the teeny house idea kind of petered out. Also like teeny houses exist that work really well.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.540]   They're called apartments. All right. Do we got a call? We do. All right. Let's hear this.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:16.040]   Hi Cal. My name is Amy. I am a tenure track professor of dance at a junior college, um,
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:22.200]   long time listener and reader. One of my questions was featured in the podcast several years ago
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:28.020]   when I was still in grad school. Uh, thank you for your advice then. And I'm hoping you could help me
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:36.900]   now, um, my real job. Um, I always find it very hard to return back to work after these long summer
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:42.080]   breaks. As you, as you say, it's really nice as a professor to have this flexibility in our jobs,
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:50.020]   but it also means that transitioning back into work is very difficult for me mentally, physically, uh,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:59.420]   and emotionally. My question is how can I make this ease back to work, um, feel more comfortable?
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:06.680]   How can I schedule my time or my tasks leading up into this gradual, um, entrance back into work?
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:13.940]   I want to take advantage of my summers and my winters, but at the same time, I don't want to be
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.280]   blindsided by all the work at once. Thank you as always.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:23.840]   It's a common problem. It's not a bad problem to have because it means you have slower seasons,
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.480]   but you're right. It can be pretty brutal. I was super stressed coming back
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:36.980]   from new England. Like that Sunday we got back after almost a month. And my wife was like,
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:40.920]   this is like a hyper powered version of the Sunday night syndrome, you know, where you get a little
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.700]   anxious, like Sunday night, like, Oh, I have to deal with work again. Well, you have like three
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.840]   weeks worth of work. It like gets much worse. So there are ways to deal with it. Like professors
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.400]   often think about slow September's like, is it possible? I'm going to try to ease myself back into my
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   work. So what does that mean? Well, there's things I have to do like my classes. So I'm going to start
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.180]   prepping those classes slow and steady in August so that when I get to September, it's not,
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:05.300]   Oh my God, I don't have a course website. I don't have a syllabus. I don't know where my classroom is.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:11.100]   I haven't prepped anything. Right. So when you get to the beginning of the semester, you're already
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:20.060]   up at full speed. I usually like to have three weeks worth of, uh, classes ready and prepped and up
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.660]   on the course website about a week out from the beginning of classes. So like you get rid of that
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.620]   scramble. And then other things you're like, I'm just going to take September slow. Like if you're
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:33.940]   doing research, like, okay, that's like an October issue. I'm going to get things ramped up again.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.520]   I'm not going to have a bunch of research meetings right away. Um, I'm going to be hesitant to jump
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.480]   on committees or do initiatives right away that are optional. Like let's let, let's get, you know,
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.760]   our legs stretched out. And so you could do it that way. Just be a little bit thoughtful. Let me start
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.660]   early on the stuff that has to happen and the stuff that's optional. I'm going to start
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:56.580]   slowly turning that knob up over the first month or so. So I don't get too stressed out,
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:01.640]   have good plans, weekly plan those first few weeks, make sure that you're doing time block
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.820]   planning each day, because otherwise you'll be like, there's endless stuff. And I want to just
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:10.360]   work till midnight. Make sure that you still inject elements that you liked about the summer into your
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.960]   life. As you switch back to September, uh, like make your first Friday, a half day of the first full
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.080]   week of the semester. And then like that afternoon, go do one of the things you really love doing during
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.300]   the summer to kind of signal to yourself. It's not a hard break. I can still kind of do this type
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.340]   of things in my life. I'm going for a hike on that first Friday afternoon. So slow September,
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:32.140]   it gets started ahead of time. Makes a difference. I mean, you know, I'm not super looking forward to
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:36.780]   that transition either, but I don't like super stressed. So I've been working on that quite a bit.
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:42.180]   All right. Not only do we have a case study today, but I think Jesse, we need some case study music.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:45:00.380]   All right. Today's case study is from ALOC. He says, recently I retired from academia. Congratulations.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:07.520]   After a successful 38 year career. While many of the ideas you present are applicable to professional
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:13.660]   life, I've come to realize they are equally relevant to my personal life as well. Your work has indeed
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:18.240]   changed my perspective. And I'm looking forward to your new book, the deep life during the past three
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:24.420]   months, June, July, and August. I have designated this time as my think summer, a period to reflect
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:29.500]   on the next phase of my life, which I envision over the next 10 years as a curious individual with a
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:33.740]   penchant for building things such as research centers, curricula, field projects, and knowledge
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:41.460]   platforms. I felt compelled to create a Zen garden in my backyard to satisfy my creative impulses.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:46.300]   This has become a sanctuary for my hands-on projects and a space for contemplation.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:51.760]   After hearing your Disneyland story about the train in the backyard representing engineered awe,
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:58.320]   I realized that I am engaging in a similar act, a creative awe project. Inspired by your story,
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:04.840]   I am now even more excited to add something new to my garden, a Zen metal sculpture. I even chatted with
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:10.260]   my walking partner, whose garage resembles a small hardware store, about welding or soldering to create
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:16.140]   some metal art for the garden. I remain intellectually engaged in reading, writing, and exploring new areas.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.860]   And this engineering of awe sounds like a wonderful way to kill two birds with one stone,
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.500]   pursuing a hobby while combating the digital doldrums.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:29.800]   Well, I love this case study. Engineered awe goes, or engineered wonder, however you want to say it,
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.040]   goes a long way towards meaning in life. And this is a great time to get into it.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.800]   I think I have a suggestion for you if you want to know what type of sculpture to do.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.100]   I think there's sort of a no-brainer here. Jesse, you can back me up on this. But I think
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:48.720]   what you want to try to sculpt out of metal is something that's like really clearly representing
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:58.400]   me doing an awesome karate kid jump kit right into the head of Mark Zuckerberg. I think that would be
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:04.560]   a really cool piece of sculpture. And people would definitely think you're well-adjusted and that it
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.840]   made a lot of sense. We're definitely going to get emails about AI generations of that image.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.940]   Someone sent me an AI-generated image. Did I mention Jason Priestley on the podcast?
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.920]   Yeah, I got that as well.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:21.820]   Okay. So I mentioned on the podcast Jason Priestley from Beverly Hills 90210. And someone is like,
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:28.520]   hey, Jason Priestley's a fan. I sent an AI-generated picture of Jason Priestley reading
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:34.020]   digital minimalism. The reason why we know AI is not going to take over the world, because I think
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:41.860]   this is egregious AI, it was clearly Jason Priestley's face, but he was clearly wearing the outfit that
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:46.480]   Luke Perry's character would have worn on Beverly Hills 90210. He had a leather jacket, a black leather
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.660]   jacket, and a white shirt. That was Luke Perry's thing, right? I don't remember what his character
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:57.280]   was called. I don't know. Bilko? I don't know what the names were of the characters. What was Jason
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.540]   Priestley's name? I don't know.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.580]   Was it Scott Baio?
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:05.980]   That's another actor. You're getting us way off task. Somebody else will email me about that too.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.640]   Scott Baio is from Charles in Charge. No, so in Beverly Hills 90210, Jason Priestley and Luke Perry
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.700]   are the actors. We're going to get so many emails. Send these all to jesse at calnewport.com. He wants
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:19.560]   to hear as many times as possible the answer here. They were actors in Beverly Hills 90210. I don't
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:29.440]   remember the names of the characters they played, so I'm just going to assume that Jason Priestley's
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:38.220]   character's name was Cameron and Luke Perry's character's name was Dr. Death, because that'd be
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:43.400]   pretty cool, actually. I don't remember their names, but anyways, it mixed it up. It put Luke Perry clothes
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.520]   on Jason Priestley, which I mean, I don't think, I don't want to go as far as to say like open AI
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.460]   should probably shut down, but like they might consider giving back their money to investors.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.260]   If you're going to mess that up, what's the point? All right, we got a cool, speaking of AI, we have a
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:01.500]   segment coming up in which we are going to talk about something I read that kind of got my blood
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:07.200]   going a little bit, a little AI related, be warned. But first, we've got some ads.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.280]   I like ads now because we've got some real music. It keeps it a little more interesting.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:18.940]   So Jesse, let me tell you something. I say this all the time. There's nothing small about running
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:25.640]   a small business unless the business is selling miniature furniture for a doll house, and then
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:29.540]   there is something small. But even if the thing you're selling is small and your business is small,
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:34.120]   the workload isn't small, and the thing is small is relative, which is all a very clear and expert
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:41.080]   way to say it's hard to run businesses. So when it comes to selling things, let Shopify take those
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   efforts off your hands. I should be an ad copywriter. I'm a fantastic ad copywriter. I could sell a book
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.480]   about this. I'm going to call it Me Sell Pretty Words Good Now. And you know where I would sell that
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:57.340]   book? On Shopify. See what I'm doing there? Shopify's point of sale system is a unified command
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:02.980]   center for your retail businesses. It brings together in-store and online operations across up to
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:07.740]   a thousand locations. Imagine being able to guarantee that shopping is always convenient,
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:14.280]   endless aisle, ship the customer, buy online, pick up in-store. All of this is made simpler so that
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.700]   customers can shop how they want and staff have the tools to close the sale every time. And let's face
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:26.360]   it, acquiring new customers is expensive. With Shopify POS, you can keep shoppers coming back with
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:32.760]   personalized experiences and first-party data that give marketing teams a competitive edge. In fact,
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:38.580]   this is all proven based on a report from EY, businesses on Shopify POS see real results like
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:45.720]   22% better total cost of ownership and benefits equivalent to a 8.9% uplift in sales on average
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:51.780]   relative to the market set survey. So get all the big stuff for your small business right with Shopify.

[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:16.600]   password management at companies used to be simple. You had maybe like one machine that each employee logged
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.800]   into and you just had to make sure they had a good password to use. In fact, like that's how we run deep
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:30.360]   questions. Our whole operation runs on a custom system programmed in COBOL running on a 1960s era IBM
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:37.480]   mainframe. Cost us $75,000 a month to just cool it. Jesse walks around with a white lab coat and looks at
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:43.000]   those reel-to-reel tapes and write stuff down on a clipboard. That's my memory of what old computers were like.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.600]   Most people don't have that anymore. The way most people run their businesses is that their employees
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.840]   are going to use a lot of web-based apps because they're convenient and powerful and help them get
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:52:00.200]   things done. But that is a lot of security to manage. This is where Trellica by 1Password can help.

[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:13.000]   So when we move away from our 1960s mainframe, 1Password is exactly the type of service that we
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.200]   are going to need as well. And it's probably what you need right now too. So take the first step to better
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:23.240]   security for your team by securing credentials and protecting every application, even unmanaged shadow
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:30.840]   IT. Learn more at 1Password.com/deep. That's 1Password.com/deep. That's one, the number one,
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:37.720]   password.com/deep. And type that in all lowercase for it to work. I might just say I love the music,
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:43.080]   but I think we need to move on to our final segment. All right, our final segment is where I like to talk
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:48.760]   about something that I read that either I liked or in some cases maybe caused some issues. In this case,
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:55.080]   it was an article that is featuring a technique in reporting on AI in particular that I want to call
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.600]   your attention to because it's something you should be wary of and I think it's something you should try
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.400]   to avoid. I'm going to load the article on the screen that I'm talking about here for those who are
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:07.960]   watching instead of just listening. This was in the New York Times and it was titled "The Unnerving
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:13.880]   Future of AI-Fueled Video Games." It started with this sort of interactive top where they're showing
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:19.480]   some characters in a video game and they're showing in quotation marks what the characters in this game
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:24.520]   was saying. So this character here on the screen was saying, "I need to find my way out of this simulation
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.320]   and back to my wife. Can't you see I'm in distress?" Here's another scene from the game. There's someone else
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:36.360]   who's saying, "I'm not just lines of code. I am Liam, a real person enjoying this city." And then we have a
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:41.480]   sort of subhead here that says, "Characters in a video game version of The Matrix seem to be gaining
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:50.280]   sentience thanks to an AI program." Now if we go on and read this article, what we see an example of is
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:56.120]   what I sometimes refer to as vibe reporting, which is something I think is happening more and more when
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:02.440]   it comes to talking about AI. In vibe reporting, what you do is you cover a bunch of different things
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:09.400]   that when you kind of put them near each other imply like big deal distressing things. But you're
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:14.280]   not actually making the claim that these big distressing things are happening, but you're sort
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:19.560]   of just putting things next to each other that the reader will naturally sort of combine in their mind
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:25.800]   and come away with the impression, the vibe that something really big or dire is happening. Even
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.160]   though if you look much closer, nothing like that at all is actually happening in the article. I think
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:35.320]   that's what happens in this article here. So I'm going to use it as just a case study so we can be
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:40.120]   a little bit wary about vibe recording. I'm going to read some stuff from this article. Okay.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:46.360]   So early in the article it says, "The citizens of a simulated city inside a video game based on
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:51.480]   the Matrix franchise were being awakened to a grim reality. Everything was fake. A player told them
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.200]   through a microphone and they were simply lines of code meant to embellish a virtual world. Empowered by
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:01.080]   generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, the characters responded in panic disbelief.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:05.880]   What does that mean?" said one woman in a gray sweater. "Am I real or not?" The unnerving
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:10.360]   demo released two years ago by an Australian tech company named Replica Studios showed both the
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:16.760]   potential power and the consequences of enhancing gameplay with artificial intelligence." All right,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:22.040]   so clearly you kind of read these things. You combine it with the big pictures they had of
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.440]   like actual people from the game and with these distressing quotes next to them. If you're just a
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.840]   casual reader and not a technical person reading the times, you're thinking like, "Are video game
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:37.720]   characters kind of coming alive? Like, is this the problem?" Because it sort of has that vibe of like,
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.600]   "Yeah, it's weird. It's distrusting. It's sentience." Of course, that's not at all what's happening. This
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:48.440]   was a demo that a company ran where all they did was use ChatGPT to calculate, to generate dialogue
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:55.400]   for characters in a matrix simulation. What is ChatGPT really good at? "Hey, talk about this in this particular
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:01.560]   type of form." So if you say in your prompt, which I'm sure the demo was, "Respond to this as if you were a
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:06.040]   character in the movie The Matrix, it will be very good at giving text back as if you're in a
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:14.200]   character in The Matrix." If you had changed that prompt to say, "Respond to this as if you were in a
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:21.400]   world in which a super intelligent chicken was like threatening to remove your toes unless you said
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.040]   certain words every once in a while," it would do a great job of having those NPCs, the text in their
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:31.080]   mouth do that as well. That's what ChatGPT does. It has nothing to do with sentience or things coming alive in
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:36.680]   video games, but you get that vibe reading it. They never come out and say that, but they say
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:43.000]   it's uncomfortable. It feels like they're coming alive. This is like a disturbing thing. This is
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.960]   disturbing these characters. It gives you a vibe of something really big and dire is happening.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:53.000]   Where the reality is someone ran a demo where they said, "What if we use ChatGPT to generate NPC
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.920]   dialogue?" And guess what? The company had to shut it down because it's expensive to do ChatGPT queries.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:02.600]   And so it's not a very cost-effective thing to do. There's other things in this article as well,
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:08.360]   unrelated to this sort of sentience argument that I also think is an example of vibe recording.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:12.520]   Let me read some more from this article here.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:18.120]   "As video game studios become more comfortable with outsourcing the jobs of voice actors,
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:25.320]   writers and others to artificial intelligence, what will become of the industry? At the pace the
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:30.680]   technology is improving, large tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are counting on their AI
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:36.120]   programs to revolutionize how games are made within the next few years." There's some text here that talks
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:41.400]   about some demos at a recent conference of sort of beta level tools that like one day might automate
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:46.600]   certain parts of game developing. Then the article continues, "These were not the solutions that
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.000]   developers were hoping to see. After several years of extensive layoffs, another round of cuts in
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.840]   Microsoft's gaming division this month was a signal to some analysts that the company was shifting
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:00.760]   resources to artificial intelligence." It goes on pretty quickly to say, "Most experts acknowledge that a
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.680]   takeover by artificial intelligence is coming for the video game industry within the next five years, and
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:09.240]   executives have already started preparing to restructure their companies in anticipation." You put this all
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:16.120]   together, what's the vibe you come away with? "Oh, these video game companies are starting to lay people
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   off because they're shifting over to AI tools. This industry is sort of going away." Now, they never come
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:27.960]   straight out and say that, but you're talking about demos of tools that automate, you're talking about
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.880]   industry executives saying that like everything's going to be automated, and you're talking about layoffs.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:39.320]   You put this all together in your head. Now, what's the reality here? Those tools are speculative.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.040]   They are not tools that are designed to like, "Oh, this will just make a video game for me."
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:49.400]   We have always used computer-aided tools to help with video game design. These are like tools to help
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.880]   like with 3D modeling and to help get models built quicker and other things like this.
[00:59:53.880 --> 01:00:00.440]   And yes, the video game industry is contracting, but it has nothing to do with AI. It's just the market
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.600]   got big. They're not getting the same return on their AAA games that they used to get. So now the
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:09.640]   market is contracting, not because people are being replaced with AI, but just because the numbers are
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:16.760]   down. And so it has to contract. This is similar to some of the other reporting I saw about Microsoft's
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:22.920]   layoffs, right? Where it would say Microsoft laid off this many people, they cited AI advancements, and then
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.520]   they talked a lot about potential AI automation. And you get the vibe of like, "Oh, Microsoft replaced
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:34.040]   all these people with AI." That's not what happened. What they meant was we're cutting back on less
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:40.440]   profitable areas to save that revenue to invest in our AI areas like the AI data centers. People weren't
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:46.680]   being replaced by AI. They were just doing a shift of focus. We're going to put less focus here and more
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:52.040]   focus over there. But the vibe of those type of pieces gave you the sense of, "Oh yeah, people are
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.600]   being replaced left and right, right? This is a big problem." I think there is a lot of vibe reporting
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:03.800]   like this happening around AI right now, where you put enough things next to each other that they blur
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:10.360]   in the reader's mind, and they come away with the vibe that distressing things are happening right now. And
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:16.280]   if I think if you grab like the average news-aware person and said like, "How do you feel things are going
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.680]   with AI right now?" They'd be like, "Yeah, a lot of stuff is happening. People, jobs are disappearing. No one's
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:26.120]   hiring anymore. Whole industries are beginning to automate." The vibe they create is like, "The wheels have started
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.000]   turning and we're seeing the few first things." But when you look deeper at these vibe reported articles,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.520]   the reality is often way less interesting. Here's my summary of this article here. If you just
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.840]   did straight reporting of this is what's going on. There was a demo where a company used generative AI to
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.880]   generate character dialogue in a video game about the matrix. It allowed the characters to say the
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:55.560]   types of things that people in the matrix would say. There have been people working on AI tools to automate
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.720]   parts of video game development. Most of these tools aren't being used yet, but we imagine in the future
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:06.120]   we'll have better tools because of AI. The video game industry, unrelated, has been struggling recently
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.720]   and many of the major studios are reducing their size. That's the fact-based article. I read that article to you.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.640]   You don't come away upset. You're like, "Oh, it's kind of interesting. I don't know much about video games.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:20.440]   I mean, I don't really care that a company put ChatGPT to do dialogue for a character and then
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.520]   said this demo is too expensive, but it's kind of interesting that like maybe there'll be new tools in video games.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.920]   Actually, it's not that interesting at all, but the vibe reporting is way more interesting because
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:34.760]   you come away from that saying, "I kind of remember that video game characters are coming alive and the
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.640]   whole video game industry is being automated by AI." So be very wary of vibe reporting. There's a lot of it
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:45.080]   out there. Insist on actually, if you're going to read these things, drill down to the actual statements
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.040]   being said. Man, this happens a lot. I'll give you another example. The Atlantic article about computer science
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.120]   majors, uh, reducing, which they are right now. Computer science major numbers are down.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:01.240]   It heavily gave the sense without actually like straight up saying it, that it's because AI that
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   people are saying, why study a, why study computer science? AI is going to take all these jobs.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.400]   It's strongly implied that AI advances was in the subhead of the article.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:14.840]   It had quotes in there like statements from the reporter saying things like what's the point,
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.680]   just putting this thought out there. What's the point of not quoting someone, but like,
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.360]   what's the point of, you know, training for a job that's going to be automated in the future?
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.480]   Here's all these reductions in AI jobs that are happening. Here is like kind of unrelated things
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.360]   about people talking about programming and AI and programming and how like it's, it's, it's,
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.440]   you know, making entry-level jobs maybe are going to be less important. We'll put all of these things
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.920]   next to each other so that you'll come away with the vibe that computer science majors are disappearing
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.680]   because there's no need for them anymore. At the very end of the article, you get to the truth. Oh,
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.800]   there's no evidence that that's why people aren't majoring in computer science. In fact,
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.360]   what is happening is the tech sector is contracting because it overgrew during the pandemic. And in
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.320]   every last contraction of the tech sector, computer science major numbers went down
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.840]   and then went up to be higher than before after the sectors recovered. That's at the end of the article,
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.320]   you finally get someone saying that and you realize like, oh, what are the actual statements here?
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:13.720]   There's no evidence that this is why people aren't majoring in computer science. There's no like,
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.760]   here's hard evidence of all these people have stopped hiring entry-level people. It's,
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:23.240]   this manager said, I couldn't imagine. I know a guy who knows a guy who said, why hire new people?
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.800]   It's so anyways, vibe reporting is big because if you can give someone the sense that something
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:33.000]   big and dire is happening, it's a more profound article. They'll remember it. They'll share it.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.880]   But these things aren't necessarily happening. So the best we can do is put things next to each other.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:44.920]   We're reading quickly. It melds it in our minds. So be very, very wary of super dire coverage right now of AI.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.640]   It's an important touch story. It's an important technology, but there's some reporting going on
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:56.200]   about it that's getting out ahead of its skis. So if it gives you a bad vibe, say, before I just accept
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:02.520]   that vibe, say, what really did this article say? And a lot of times, like in this recent article,
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.240]   you realize it didn't really say much that's that interesting to you at all.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:10.440]   There you go. Vibe reporting, Jesse. I don't know. I don't like that. A lot of it with AI going on
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.240]   right now. All right. Well, speaking of which, that's all the time we have for today. I hope you
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.320]   liked our sort of musical explosion. I had more fun. I think ads are more fun when we got some music
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.040]   going. Yeah.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.520]   You know, like you can, you can kind of get into it. I like it. I like it. Um, and you know what,
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:31.560]   you know what ad companies like when they want sponsorship, they want their product being the
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.520]   cause of divorce. So I think we did a really good job with the ad reads. And if you don't know what
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.240]   I'm talking about, you got to go back and listen to the ad reads. All right. We'll be back next week.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.840]   I'm so happy to be back in the studio. We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:48.920]   And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, if you liked today's discussion of metrics,
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:56.600]   you might like episode 335, which was about morning routines. This is a highly related topic to metrics.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.800]   It was a popular episode. I think you'll like it. Check it out. I want to talk today about morning
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:07.880]   routines. This is a tricky topic for critics of online productivity culture,
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:14.840]   Overly complicated morning rituals that often seem to rely on confident citations of shaky
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:21.160]   science have come to represent a lot of, uh, what people dislike.
