[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   How important is it to spend time with the right people?
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.280]   I mean, look, it's the difference between a good life
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.440]   and a bad life is, is who you surround yourself with. There
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.120]   is scientific evidence that shows that the people that you
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.900]   surround yourself with the people that create your
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.000]   environment are going to shape your outcomes in your reality.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.160]   There's a scientific effect called the Pygmalion effect,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.160]   which says that we rise to the level of others expectations for
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.520]   us, or we fall to that level of expectations. So if you surround
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.640]   yourself with people who are encouraging you to think bigger,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.600]   who believe in you, who are pushing you that you're capable
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.800]   of more than you're currently doing, you will naturally rise
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.480]   to that level of expectations, you will improve yourself. So
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.200]   finding your way into those rooms, creating those
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.080]   communities, surrounding yourself with people who are embracing
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.400]   the fact that you have a dynamic potential as a human being can
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.840]   completely change your life.
