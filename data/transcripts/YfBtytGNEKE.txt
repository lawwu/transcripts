[00:12:50.140 --> 00:13:00.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   - There are a lot of startups moving fast in this space
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.140]   and I think we're all going to be here together.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.300]   - Hello, welcome everyone.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:39.220]   We're super excited to have you here.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.300]   This is our first meetup ever in London.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.720]   And how are you?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   (audience cheering)
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.220]   And this is actually our biggest event ever that we've done.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.220]   When we first announced it, I expected 50 people to come.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.720]   Then we got 500 people registered
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.220]   and finally we ended up with I think about 1,000 people,
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.720]   which is insane.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.220]   Thank you guys for joining us.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.720]   We have some really exciting things to show you tonight.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.220]   We're going to start with some product announcements.
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.720]   Then you'll hear from Imad from Stability,
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.220]   Nuno from Lanching,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.220]   and then we also have some really exciting surprises
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.220]   for you guys backstage.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.220]   But first, I want to tell you a little bit
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.220]   about how you can be a part of the Weights & Dices community.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.220]   So if you like what you see today,
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.220]   if you like the people that you meet,
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.220]   I would love for you guys to join our Discord.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.720]   You can find it at that link right there.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   Our Discord is full of machine learning practitioners
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   who are really helping each other.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.220]   That's the core of our community.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.220]   We really want anyone to be able to join us
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.220]   and then we want everyone to be helpful
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.220]   to other machine learning engineers
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.220]   and help everyone get better.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.220]   This is a community we're super proud of building
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.220]   and we really hope that you join us.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.220]   Next up, we also believe that machine learning
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.720]   should be accessible to everyone
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.720]   and also learning machine learning should be free.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   So we've been creating all of these different courses
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.720]   to help machine learning engineers
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.220]   learn to put their models in production.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.720]   And in these courses, we share best practices
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.220]   that we have learned from working
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.720]   with some of the best machine learning teams for years.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.220]   And you can find them at 1b.me/courses.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.220]   We also have Fully Connected, our blog.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.720]   Anyone here heard of Fully Connected?
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   There's one person, huh?
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   I love a new audience.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   So Fully Connected is our blog.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   You can see it on the left.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   So this is full of tutorials
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.220]   that are written by machine learning engineers
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.720]   just like you on the most important topics of the day.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   So if a new model comes out,
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   you can probably expect a deep dive on it
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   on Fully Connected in the next few days.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   And you can find it at 1b.me/fc.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   Also, we love throwing events, as you can probably tell.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   And we run about four to eight events a week.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   My events team is insane.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.220]   They're in the crowd, and they work really hard.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.720]   A lot of these events are virtual,
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   so you guys can all join them.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   And you can find them at 1b.me/events.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   But that's not all.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   So we're super excited to announce
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   that we're hosting our first-ever user conference
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   in San Francisco in person on June 7th.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.220]   We don't have a sign-up page just yet,
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.220]   but if you watch our social media,
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.720]   we're gonna post a link to it there soon.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   And finally, we also have a podcast
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.220]   that we're super proud of.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.720]   It kind of started as a joke between me and our co-founder,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.220]   and it's been going on for three years now.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.220]   So our podcast is where Lucas, our CEO,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.220]   takes you behind the scenes
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.220]   to learn from industry leaders like Jensen,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.720]   the CEO of NVIDIA,
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.220]   about how to put your models in production.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.720]   And you can find it at beatsandbias at 1b.me/gd.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.220]   And speaking of the host,
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.220]   I would love to welcome our co-founder on stage.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.220]   Um...
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.220]   (applause)
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.220]   Woo!
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.220]   (applause)
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.220]   - All right. All right.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.220]   Yeah, guys, yeah.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.220]   What an exciting night.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.220]   I can feel a real buzz in the air, you know?
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.220]   Oh, boy.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.220]   Some of you might be asking,
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.220]   "Why is there a grown man wearing a bee costume
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.220]   "up on stage right now?"
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.220]   Just know I'm asking myself that same question.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.220]   Let's get this night started
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.220]   by doing a little audience participation.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.220]   How many folks have used WANdB?
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.220]   Make some noise!
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.220]   Oh, yeah, all right.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.720]   What about LangChain?
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.220]   We got any LangChain users out there tonight?
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.220]   All right, yeah.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.220]   Stability AI fans, maybe.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.220]   Can we make some noise?
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.220]   All right.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.220]   All right, let's try this.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.220]   Everyone that likes TensorFlow, say, "Hey!"
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:32.220]   PyTorch, "Ho!"
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.220]   Yeah? Okay.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.220]   - Okay, that's enough of that.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.220]   - Yeah, okay, okay.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.220]   - That's the wrong co-founder.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.220]   I actually wanted to welcome Lucas Beewald, our CEO,
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.220]   to tell you about some interesting product announcements.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:54.220]   (applause)
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.220]   - Awesome.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.220]   Did you just walk off with a clicker?
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.220]   Nice.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.220]   It's so awesome to be here.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.220]   This isn't exactly what I thought I was signing up for
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.220]   doing a meetup in London, but this is so much better.
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.220]   I was actually in San Francisco a few weeks ago
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.220]   for Hugging Faces, awesome Woodstock AI event, I guess.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.220]   And it's been, that was an amazing event, and I loved it.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.220]   But it's been almost even more exciting to walk through
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.220]   the audience here and just see what you all are up to.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.220]   It's amazing.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.220]   I really appreciate it.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.220]   I'm CEO of Weights & Biases.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.220]   I'm Lucas Beewald.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.220]   And I'm here to talk about Weights & Biases for LLMs.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.220]   Do you have the clicker?
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.220]   I can use the laptop.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.220]   No worries.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.220]   And since a lot of you actually hadn't used Weights & Biases,
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.220]   before we get into Weights & Biases for LLMs,
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.220]   I just wanted to go through what Weights & Biases does.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.220]   And our mission has always been to build the best tools
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.220]   for machine learning practitioners,
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.220]   and we define machine learning practitioners broadly
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.220]   as anyone that's trying to make machine learning models
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.220]   work in the real world.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.220]   That's how we've always thought about it.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.220]   And so the history of the company in a nutshell,
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.220]   it's actually been five years and things have changed a lot.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.220]   We started off, it was just me and that B,
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.220]   the third co-founder who was back in San Francisco
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.220]   working really hard on the next products.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.220]   And we built a thing called Experiments that was to help people,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.220]   including ourselves, do experiment tracking.
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.220]   So keep track of all the models that we were building
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.220]   and kind of understand where they regressed
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.220]   and understand how to make them better.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.220]   And not long after we built this, people asked,
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.220]   "Hey, could you help us make a system to make models automatically better?"
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.220]   And so we built Sweeps, which is a hyperparameter tuning system.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.220]   Thank you. Awesome.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.220]   And then not long after that, people said,
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.220]   "Well, you know, we really want to share the stuff that we're doing
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.220]   with colleagues and our boss."
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.220]   And then eventually, actually, the whole world,
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.220]   and that was reports that we built.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.220]   And then people started saying,
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.220]   "You know, we really want full reproducibility here.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.220]   We want to track not just the model architecture
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.220]   but the training data that went into the models."
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.220]   And that's complicated because it's changing all the time.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.220]   And so we built a thing called Artifacts.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.220]   Then folks wanted to explore data, so we built Tables.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.220]   They wanted to track things in production.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.220]   So recently, this is actually just a few months ago,
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.220]   we launched Models.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.220]   And then our most recent launch to date is something called Launch,
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.220]   which came from people asking,
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:23.220]   "Can I actually automatically run jobs from the Weights & Biases interface?"
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.220]   So it's always been guided by requests from people like you
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.220]   who were using machine learning and had problems they were running into
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.220]   and were talking to us and telling us,
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.220]   "Hey, here's a new thing that I need."
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.220]   But today, we're here to talk specifically about LLMs,
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.220]   which we've been thinking a lot about inside of Weights & Biases.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.220]   And just from talking to all of you,
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.220]   I know that you've all been thinking about it too.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.220]   And to kind of ground this in our perspective,
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.220]   we think there's sort of three ML practitioner types,
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   and you may be all three or just one of these.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.220]   The first is large language model creators, right?
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.220]   So these are folks that are training LLMs from scratch,
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.220]   these big models.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.220]   These are kind of hardcore machine learning people.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.220]   The second is the LLM fine tuners.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.220]   So these are people that are taking models
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.220]   and adding a little bit more data to do something interesting with them.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.220]   And then finally, the LLM prompt engineers,
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.220]   who use LLMs as an API or a service
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.220]   and try to figure out how to interact with that LLM
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.220]   to make something useful happen.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.220]   And these days, prompt engineer could be almost anyone.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:30.220]   So I want to start a little bit with what we do for LLM creators.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.220]   And these companies and organizations actually all build LLMs,
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.220]   and they're all long-time customers of Weights & Biases
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.220]   that we feel super proud of.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.220]   Actually, large model training was our very first use case
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.220]   in our bread and butter.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.220]   This is us at OpenAI back in 2018,
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.220]   when it was really just a handful of people,
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.220]   and we were just a handful of people.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   And this is our first product manager, Carrie,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.220]   talking to Peter over there.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.220]   And Peter's actually showing a very first iteration
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.220]   of a Weights & Biases dashboard,
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.220]   which I think we knew we were onto something
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.220]   when OpenAI decided to take that dashboard
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.220]   and kind of put it on their wall there.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.220]   That was really a joy to see that.
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.220]   We had about 10 users at the time,
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.220]   and I think nine of them were inside of OpenAI.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.220]   And so at that time,
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.220]   they were talking about scaling infrastructure for large models.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.220]   And you go back to 2018, and they were thinking,
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.220]   "Wow, we're going to need so much more infrastructure
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.220]   to make these models work."
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.220]   And they were totally right about that.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   But another thing that they were talking to us about
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.220]   is actually scaling the teams to build these large models.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.220]   And this is actually the very first case study we did,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.220]   also back in 2019, I believe,
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.220]   where they say, "You know, when we have 10 to 20 people
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.220]   working with our code base,
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.220]   at any point someone could commit a change
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.220]   and break something."
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.220]   And that's what I really, really want to help them with that.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.220]   And it's been so exciting to see
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.220]   so many other organizations kind of get to the point
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.220]   where they have 10 people or 20 people
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.220]   trying to build something together,
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.220]   trying to build a machine learning thing together,
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.220]   and then you run into these things.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.220]   And it's funny because, you know, back then,
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.220]   10 seemed like a lot of people to work on a model together.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.220]   And then, you know, these organizations like Meta
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.220]   or Facebook Research Labs became hundreds of people.
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.220]   And now with the way stability is working
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   and other organizations kind of in public
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.220]   and letting anyone in,
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.220]   these teams are, practically speaking,
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.220]   thousands of people working together,
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.220]   all trying to make models better.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.220]   And so, one really exciting trend here
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.220]   is the open sourcing of models.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.220]   And stability has absolutely been at the forefront of this.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.220]   But we first saw it with DALI Mini,
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.220]   which was an open source version of DALI,
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.220]   where the author of this kept a training journal.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.220]   And it's like hundreds and hundreds of pages
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.220]   of weights and biases, logs,
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.220]   of every single thing that they did.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.220]   And it's actually really interesting to watch his process
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.220]   as he learns how to do this.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.220]   And then the next one we saw was Eleuther
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.220]   doing public experiment tracking on GPT-J
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.220]   and NeoX, completely in public,
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.220]   completely where everyone could see it.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.220]   And you can actually follow this link right now
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.220]   and look at kind of the evolution of all of these models.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.220]   And lately we've seen things like OpenAssist,
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.220]   which just came out and is really exciting.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.220]   And of course, StableLM,
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.220]   which was released yesterday, I believe.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.220]   So, good timing for this event.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.220]   But also something that we feel really proud
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.220]   to have helped in a little way with.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.220]   So, training LMs is not a small feat
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.220]   and I would not undertake it lightly.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.220]   And I don't actually recommend it to most of our customers.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.220]   But we did want to offer a little bit
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.220]   in the way of helping people that insist on doing this.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.220]   And it's surprising how many people insist on trying this.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.220]   We have a white paper at LLM White Paper.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.220]   We've kind of combined all the sort of best practices
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.220]   that we've seen across different types of organizations
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.220]   that want to spend millions of dollars on compute
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.220]   and hire kind of the hardest to hire people
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.220]   and bring them together to train an LLM from scratch.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.220]   But now, I think the most exciting trend
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.220]   in the last couple of years for us has been LLM fine-tuning.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.220]   And this used to be a research topic.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.220]   I think, you know, back in the aughts,
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.220]   lots of people talked about fine-tuning,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.220]   a lot of papers on fine-tuning.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.220]   But most companies didn't do it, right?
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.220]   And this is where you take an existing model
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.220]   and you kind of use the fact
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.220]   that it's been trained on lots of data.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.220]   But then you take it and you feed in
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.220]   a smaller set of your own data.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.220]   So you get the kind of power of the LLM,
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.220]   but you've made it unique to your use case.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.220]   And it works super, super well, right?
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   Lots and lots of people do it.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   But I think it was hard to do until Hugging Face came along
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.220]   and made it incredibly easy, just a few lines of code,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.220]   to take existing large models and then fine-tune them.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.220]   And also, they made a place
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.220]   where people could publish these models.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.220]   So tons and tons of models at Hugging Face.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.220]   It's an amazing product.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.220]   And so we actually, we built a zero-line integration
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.220]   a long time ago.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.220]   All you have to do is import WANDB,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.220]   and then you get these nice little dashboards.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.220]   It's much less of an engineering undertaking for us
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.220]   to ingest all this data.
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.220]   So we appreciate when people fine-tune
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.220]   instead of building from scratch.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.220]   We can make these graphs with almost no cost to ourselves.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.220]   And we love it.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.220]   All the people that do it.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.220]   And I think all these same products
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.220]   that were sort of built for training from scratch,
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.220]   they work the same way for fine-tuning.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.220]   You still often want to do hyperparameter searches
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.220]   over what's the best learning rate,
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.220]   what's the best batch size,
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.220]   what kind of data should I feed in.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.220]   You still want to look at what's the input data.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   In fact, the data lineage can get more complicated
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.220]   with fine-tuning as you kind of feed in different data
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.220]   as your model evolves over time.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.220]   Tables and exploration is important
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.220]   for any application of machine learning.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.220]   But it's especially important on text, right?
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.220]   Where you want to look at
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.220]   what exactly is the model doing in specific cases.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.220]   And everyone should use a model registry,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.220]   even if you don't use weights and biases models,
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.220]   to keep track of the model life cycle.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.220]   So you know actually what you're putting in production.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   The number of stories that I've heard
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.220]   of just sort of simple mistakes,
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.220]   including from Ahmad a few minutes ago,
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.220]   just blows our mind.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.220]   You all should be using some kind of model registry,
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.220]   no matter what you're doing.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.220]   And kind of all this has been super exciting.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.220]   We've actually tracked over 200 million hours of compute
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.220]   on weights and biases.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.220]   And a huge boost of popularity and the mainstreaming
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.220]   came from this fine-tuning on large language models.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.220]   So we actually are announcing today,
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.220]   and I think this could be relevant to a lot of you,
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.220]   a free course that we're putting out
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.220]   on best practices for training and fine-tuning LM.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.220]   So you're welcome to go here right now
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.220]   and sign up and register for it.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.220]   It's completely free.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.220]   Our courses get really good reviews,
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.220]   and it's made by experts in our community
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.220]   that have done this a lot themselves.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.220]   All right.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.220]   So the big thing that we've been thinking about,
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.220]   maybe the most exciting thing going on right now,
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.220]   which I think is contributing to why
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.220]   we actually had to turn away people from this event.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.220]   Which I've got to tell you,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.220]   as an entrepreneur, turning away people from your own event,
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   it just, like, breaks your heart.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.220]   Like, it kills you.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.220]   Like, we've got a bigger venue and then a bigger venue,
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.220]   and then we couldn't get an even bigger venue.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.220]   So for folks on the livestream that couldn't actually get,
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.220]   sign in, I apologize.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.220]   We'll get you in the next one.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.220]   This is prompt engineering, right?
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.220]   And this is, like, the most popular way
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.220]   to use large language models right now.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.220]   You don't fine-tune it.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.220]   You don't build it yourself.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.220]   You just take something off the shelf
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   and then figure out how to make it useful.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.220]   And I'm assuming almost all of you have fine-tuned something,
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.220]   but I don't want to be speaking past anyone.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.220]   So what I actually mean by prompt engineering
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.220]   is you take a model,
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.220]   and instead of building your own translation model
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.220]   like I would have done,
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.220]   and I actually did do in grad school,
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.220]   and that work that is completely irrelevant now,
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.220]   instead of doing that,
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.220]   spending years of your life on that,
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.220]   you just ask the model,
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.220]   "Hey, could you please translate this from English into Italian?"
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.220]   And then it does it beautifully.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.220]   Amazing.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.220]   And then you can do things like solve
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.220]   almost every classical NLP problem
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.220]   just by asking a large language model.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.220]   So sentiment analysis, another classic problem,
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   you just say, "Hey, is this tweet positive or negative?"
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.220]   Instead of doing any classical machine learning
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.220]   or even deep learning.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.220]   And then this actually does get subtle and interesting
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.220]   the second you try to really do this.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.220]   So I think one of the most salient and kind of fun papers on this,
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.220]   some of you might remember this, right,
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.220]   is actually doing math question answering
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.220]   and logic question answering,
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.220]   where they started off by just asking the question,
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.220]   and then they added, "Let's think through this step by step."
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.220]   It actually causes the model to answer the question step by step,
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.220]   which amazingly causes the accuracy of the model to improve a lot.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.220]   So that made GPT-3 go from kind of below state-of-the-art
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.220]   on some of these benchmarks
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.220]   to actually above the state-of-the-art.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.220]   And I think this was part of a big explosion
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   of new ways to actually frame asking models well
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.220]   to get the answer that you want.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.220]   And so one question that I've been asking myself,
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.220]   and a lot of people have been asking me,
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.220]   is does building the best tools for machine learning practitioners
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.220]   still matter, right?
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.220]   This has been kind of our North Star since we started the company,
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.220]   and we've really had amazing success doing it.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.220]   But you might wonder, we don't need a lot of the methods
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.220]   that a lot of us studied in school anymore, right?
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.220]   Like, I think you wouldn't build a standalone translation system, probably.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.220]   You wouldn't build a standalone sentiment analysis system, probably.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   Do we even need machine learning practitioners?
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.220]   And I guess the way I look at this,
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   and maybe this is just optimism,
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.220]   I guess I argue that the market just massively expanded.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.220]   I think every software developer, maybe every person now,
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.220]   can be a machine learning practitioner the way we defined it,
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.220]   in the sense that everyone can use machine learning models
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.220]   for real-world applications without needing a lot of training.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.220]   And so what we've seen, and you really, really feel this in San Francisco,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.220]   let me tell you, in Silicon Valley, you just feel this so acutely,
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:39.220]   there's been an absolute explosion of generative AI companies.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.220]   And the demos that these companies do are unbelievable.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.220]   They're so powerful.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.220]   I used a product called Tome AI the other day,
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.220]   and I typed in "Weights and Biases Sales Pitch,"
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.220]   and I got out a PowerPoint deck that was like a pretty good
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.220]   "Weights and Biases Sales Pitch."
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.220]   Just the number of astounding demos is awesome.
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.220]   And some people might call it hype.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.220]   I think there is a sense that this is hype,
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.220]   but I look at this, and I've been doing this a long time,
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.220]   and I've seen a lot of hype cycles.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.220]   These companies really do do useful things,
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.220]   and many of them use "Weights and Biases,"
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.220]   and we really want to support them in what they're doing.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.220]   We think it's incredibly important,
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   and we've been thinking a lot about this over the last couple months.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.220]   How can we support these generative AI companies well?
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.220]   And so I'm actually super excited.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   This is an opportunity.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.220]   We've never really done a big product launch,
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.220]   and this is slightly accidental, but we're really doing it.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   We're actually really announcing
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.220]   the biggest product launch that we've had in the company,
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.220]   which is "Weights and Biases Prompts,"
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   which is our new LLMOps tool set.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.220]   And so "Weights and Biases Prompts"
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.220]   includes a lot of new functionality,
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.220]   and I want to show it to you
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.220]   with a real-world use case that we really did.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.220]   And this use case, which I love --
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.220]   I don't know if any of you have tried this --
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.220]   is we're putting SQL on a database
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.220]   from a question and a schema.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   And I've seen in the last 20 years that I've been doing this
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.220]   so many variations of this, and it's always so annoying.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.220]   It's always so bad.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.220]   It sounds good to just type in text and query your data set,
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.220]   and it's always so bad.
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   But in this case, it finally really works.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.220]   We've really seen this.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.220]   So here we're inputting our schema and a question,
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.220]   like, "Find the ID of the first product we send a customer."
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.220]   And what we're hoping for here is this kind of output,
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.220]   where it's SQL, and then we're going to run the output.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.220]   And so I don't know how many of you have actually tried this,
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.220]   but what this code looks like here is something like this.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   It's probably hard to read, but it's Python code.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.220]   We have a prompt template, and we have a set of questions.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.220]   And then we have a simple integration with OpenAI
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.220]   done through LangChain.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.220]   And then we create a table of the results,
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.220]   and then actually the "Weights and Biases" integration
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.220]   is just this one line at the bottom here
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   where it's logging what happened.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.220]   So it's like...
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:59.220]   So each row here is a different question,
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.220]   and here's SQL that we're getting back
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   from asking that question.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.220]   And honestly, it looks pretty plausible, right?
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.220]   This is really run on real data.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.220]   And then we're looking at these giant full model inputs
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.220]   because we're actually inputting the full schema.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   But we can go through this and look for bugs
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.220]   that we might be encountering.
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.220]   We're also tracking the model name and temperature
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.220]   because if there's one thing I've learned in my life,
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.220]   it's like you want to automatically write down
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   the different things that you're doing,
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.220]   and prompt engineering is absolutely no different.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   A week from now, I'm going to wonder what I did,
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.220]   and I'm going to be so happy that it's going to automatically
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.220]   log the temperature of the model that I was using.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.220]   So that seems like it's working,
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.220]   and then we actually really want to run it.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.220]   So LangChain makes this very easy to do.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.220]   So our first step in this LangChain iteration
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.220]   is generating SQL, and then the next step
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   is we're going to execute that SQL.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   Okay, so what this looks like is actually
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.220]   we're going to show you the integration at the top here.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.220]   It's a one-liner of just 1dbtracer.init,
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   and what that does is it makes it automatically log
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.220]   everything that LangChain's doing.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   And so we're setting up a chain here
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.220]   where first it's asking the question,
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   and then it's running the SQL that comes back.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.220]   And here's where we feed in the questions,
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   and we use a template, and we run the chain,
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.220]   and you can see that you get these cryptic errors here.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   And, you know, LangChain, one of LangChain's
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   essentially founders is here today,
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.220]   so I'm not going to criticize this too much.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   It's really hard to make good error messages.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.220]   But I think this is actually a lot clearer
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.220]   what's going on, even though this is still pretty complicated.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.220]   So here's the string preview, so the question was
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.220]   get my last ten orders.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.220]   Here's the schema that we passed in,
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.220]   so this was both fed in to a template.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.220]   And then I'm looking and I'm seeing there's no output,
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.220]   so what's going on?
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.220]   I can look at the error messages,
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.220]   and actually I'm getting different errors
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.220]   on different runs of this LangChain.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.220]   And so you can go into this tracer,
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.220]   and it actually looks a lot like a stack trace
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.220]   for the engineers in the audience, right?
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.220]   And it has two steps in that trace.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.220]   So there's an open AI step where it's
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.220]   asking the question with the prompt.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.220]   Here's my database schema, and here's my question.
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   And if you look, you can see the output here
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.220]   is giving us a bunch of metadata,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.220]   so a number of tokens and the tokens used,
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.220]   and then the transform chain step,
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   which is running it, gives us an error.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.220]   And in this case, the error is that
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.220]   the object is an iterable, and it turns out
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.220]   kind of a dumb error.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.220]   In this case, the language model
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.220]   actually sent me empty data.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   And these are some of the weird quirks
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.220]   of the open AI integration.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.220]   If you send it too short of a prompt
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.220]   or too long of a prompt, it can just error out
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   and send you nothing, and then downstream
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.220]   you get these bizarre errors that take you forever to debug.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.220]   So again, we're just trying to solve
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   the simple problems like that,
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.220]   and we're giving you a lot of easy access
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.220]   into everything that's going on.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.220]   Most of it you'll never need,
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.220]   but when you do need it,
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.220]   you'll be happy that you had it.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:48.220]   So then, here was the idea to make this better.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   So it turned out some of the SQLs malformed,
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.220]   and incredibly, the solution here
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.220]   was to generate the SQL, then go back
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.220]   and ask the same LM, "Okay, you generated the SQL,
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.220]   "could you please debug your own SQL and make it better?"
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.220]   (laughs)
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.220]   And then execute that SQL.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.220]   So that's the new lang chain.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.220]   I guess this is state of the art.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.220]   And here we're creating these steps here.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:15.220]   And you can see we're inserting the clean SQL chain,
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.220]   which says, "Please correct any syntax errors
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.220]   "in the following SQL,"
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.220]   which you actually just generated for me.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.220]   And then you can see here that actually
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.220]   all these runs are successful.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.220]   So the output is true.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.220]   You can actually see that the inputs here are the same,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.220]   but there's kind of this intermediate result.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.220]   And it's asking, "Find the top one customers
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.220]   "that have spent the most money."
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.220]   The SQLs right here really is real.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.220]   And I'll tell you, this actually is the right output
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.220]   on this dataset.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.220]   So this model worked at least these three times
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.220]   that we are showing it to you here.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.220]   And again, you can see actually
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.220]   a little bit more of a complicated stack trace
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.220]   because there's three steps here.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.220]   You can see the output here is SQL,
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.220]   and look at that dot.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.220]   For some reason, they put that period in there.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   Again, these like maddening little errors
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.220]   that are so frustrating to debug.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.220]   And then it's going to pass that into this step
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   where it sees that period and takes it out.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.220]   And actually, it cleans up the formatting slightly
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.220]   if you look closely, which I think is also
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.220]   kind of a delightful feature of that step.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.220]   And then it runs it and gets a useful output.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.220]   Okay.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   So then the kind of final thing here is,
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   what do you do when you want to explore what happened?
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.220]   Right?
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.220]   So this is, I mean, I'm giving you
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.220]   the kind of fun debugging steps, right?
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.220]   But the reality is you try a thousand things
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.220]   and you kind of like build up this big set of things
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.220]   that you tried, and you kind of then want to go back
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.220]   and look at, okay, what worked and what didn't.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.220]   And actually, in the case of LLMs,
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.220]   even working is a little bit ill-defined, right?
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.220]   It's often outputting something that's, you know,
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.220]   maybe sort of right, or you want to make
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.220]   a little bit better.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.220]   And so we've built this really flexible table here,
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.220]   which you can query with essentially arbitrary code, right?
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.220]   You can do grouping and filtering.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.220]   And...
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.220]   So for example here, we're grouping by
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.220]   whether it's successful or not.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.220]   So you can actually, even though these all look successful,
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:08.220]   we can find all the errors and see if we see patterns
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.220]   in the failures that are happening.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.220]   We can also kind of create new columns
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.220]   that are created from other columns.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   So for example here, after the fact,
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   we're creating a column which asks ourselves,
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   does our prompt contain orders?
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   Right?
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220]   So it's saying, you know, some of our queries
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.220]   included orders, some didn't.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.220]   We want to filter down just to those.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.220]   So the ones that actually has orders are marked as true.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.220]   And then we're going to group in the same way,
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.220]   kind of chaining together different steps here.
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.220]   And then we can analyze this data.
[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.220]   So we're super excited about that.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.220]   We've also built an OpenAI integration
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.220]   that looks almost the same as the Langtian integration,
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   but has a slightly different structure.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   But again, one line to kind of automatically get
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   all the information that happens as you do
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   the OpenAI integration.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   And we've also created a way to quickly
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.220]   evaluate your models.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:03.220]   And what we did here was we wrapped OpenAI evals.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.220]   Because so many people have been running this question of,
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.220]   how do I know if a model's working or not?
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.220]   I showed you that I properly generated SQL,
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.220]   but did it give me the right answer?
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   It's kind of an open question.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.220]   I had a funny interview with the CEO of Rappel.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.220]   And he said, "I think you're a little bit
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.220]   "too far in the wrong direction."
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.220]   So all these things that I'm showing you
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.220]   were made by engineers,
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.220]   mostly back in the SF office.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.220]   They worked super, super hard on this,
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.220]   and this is, I think, really excellent.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.220]   But for the last demo, we actually have
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.220]   the author of the demo,
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.220]   my co-founder, Chris, who built this
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.220]   to show it to you.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.220]   (applause)
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:39.220]   - That's right.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.220]   This bee can write JavaScript.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.220]   We're releasing our JavaScript SDK
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.220]   for working with tools like LangChain
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.220]   and easily building apps.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.220]   So it's npm install wnv-sdk.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.220]   There might be a couple bugs.
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.220]   Probably not, though.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.220]   If there are, let me know.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.220]   We'll fix it.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.220]   Next slide, Luke.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.220]   So this is it in action.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.220]   You just paste two lines,
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.220]   very similar to the Python API.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.220]   So you bring in the tracer,
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.220]   you write your LangChain,
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.220]   and you run it.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.220]   In this case, we're doing a SQL generation task again.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.220]   I have a database of a bunch of CDs
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.220]   and tracks.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.220]   And we can ask the question,
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.220]   like, what genres are the most popular?
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.220]   Or which artist released the most tracks?
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.220]   Or what goofballs zinged the most zoinks?
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.220]   I was trying to get it to not work,
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.220]   but it worked.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.220]   It hallucinated.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.220]   So here, yeah, we can see the sequence
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.220]   of the code.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.220]   So this is the code.
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.220]   So here, yeah, we can see the SQL
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.220]   actually getting generated here,
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.220]   just like we did in the Python SDK.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.220]   And if we refresh,
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.220]   we can finally get the answer to
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.220]   what goofballs zinged the most zoinks.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.220]   The query orders by
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.220]   Zorks zinged.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.220]   And the answer is Iron Maiden,
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.220]   U2, Led Zeppelin, Metallica,
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.220]   and Lost.
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.220]   So there you have it.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.220]   Play with WMB SDK.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.220]   Thanks, everyone.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.220]   [applause]
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.220]   All right.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.220]   So in summary,
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.220]   we've just shown you a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.220]   We've shown you improved flexible
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.220]   tables for doing language
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.220]   exploration. We've shown you
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.220]   a new prompt tracer.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.220]   We've shown you a LangTan integration,
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.220]   OpenAI integration, a way to launch
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.220]   OpenAI vowels, and a JavaScript integration.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.220]   And I just want to say, none of this
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.220]   is vaporware.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.220]   This is all live right now.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.220]   If you go to this link, wmb.me/lms,
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.220]   you can actually use all this stuff
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.220]   immediately, and I really hope you use it,
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.220]   and I really hope that you find it useful.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.220]   We're super excited to launch this.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.220]   [applause]
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:57.220]   We're also, I have to say,
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.220]   we're really hard at work,
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.220]   and we have lots of ideas about what's next,
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.220]   but we love collaborating.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.220]   I'll give you a real-world example.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.220]   This user on Twitter is asking for
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.220]   an integration to 1DB Sweeps
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.220]   from an LLM project,
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.220]   and our team jumped on this
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.220]   immediately, so we really are responsive,
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.220]   and we really are listening,
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.220]   and we'd really love to know what you need.
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.220]   So please come up to us and tell us what you need,
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.220]   or go to us on Twitter and ask us for
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.220]   things that will make your life easy as you do
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.220]   LLM prompt engineering
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.220]   or build LLMs from scratch. Thank you.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.220]   [applause]
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.220]   Back to Lovanya.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.220]   [applause]
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.220]   - All right.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.220]   I hope you guys are excited about
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.220]   the new products. Next up,
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.220]   we have Imad from Stability
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.220]   who is going to give a talk.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.220]   [applause]
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.220]   - Thank you very much.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.220]   [applause]
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.220]   Hi, everyone.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.220]   Gosh, there's a few people here, eh?
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.220]   Um...
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.220]   It's an exciting time. I don't think anyone's
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.220]   ever seen anything quite like this.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.220]   I just found out today that it's not actually
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:07.220]   1DB, it's
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.220]   1B, and that's why there's a B with a wand.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.220]   So my apologies
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.220]   for thinking it was a database. I always get a bit confused.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.220]   No, really, thank you,
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.220]   Lucas, for having me here.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.220]   And I think, you know, this is the key thing. It's magic, right?
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.220]   Any sufficiently advanced
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.220]   technology is magic, and I think we've all
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.220]   here kind of seen that.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.220]   One of the things I was commenting on earlier
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   is, does anyone know a single smart
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.220]   person that isn't excited and terrified
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.220]   by this? No,
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.220]   we all know in our circles, like, you know, with crypto, it was like,
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.220]   well, you know, there are people that are excited about it,
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.220]   but a whole bunch of people are like, eh, whereas this is
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.220]   everyone. But it's a bit like no true Scotsman.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.220]   If they aren't excited about it
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.220]   now, then they're not intelligent.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.220]   So, you know. That's a good test of
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.220]   all your friends, right? But even my mum's asking me
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.220]   about it constantly, not just because I'm a CEO.
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.220]   She's like, "Imad, what's this?" And like,
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.220]   she's like making me memes with the new image models
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.220]   saying, "Why don't you call me enough?" You know, like,
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.220]   [laughter]
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.220]   again, the superpowers that you have, I think, are going to be
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.220]   quite insane.
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.220]   So, again, thank you all for coming here. Let's see, do I
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.220]   just press this button? Hey, stability AI,
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.220]   there we go. End of the world as we know it.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   Oh, gosh.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:19.220]   One of the ways I like to put it is that
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.220]   everyone's here because of a
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.220]   story. You all love kind of ML
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.220]   or you're terrified by it, in which case,
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.220]   you know, just please bother
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.220]   Lucas about it because he's enabling it, not me.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.220]   And
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.220]   that's how we kind of scale the society.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.220]   We first of all, ooh.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.220]   Maybe if I step this way.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.220]   First of all, we
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.220]   kind of told stories and we had our try.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.220]   Then we took the stories and we put
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   them down and that allowed us to scale
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.220]   even more and it allowed us to create corporations
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.220]   and organizations with bylaws
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.220]   and constitutions and organizations
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.220]   right now are slow dumb AI.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.220]   They are slow dumb AI
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.220]   that has to make us legible so they take away
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.220]   our creativity and freedom and we're kind of
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.220]   sad as a result of that because
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.220]   text is a lossy
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.220]   information format.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.220]   And I think that's something that's quite important
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.220]   because the easiest way for us to communicate is what we're
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.220]   doing right now, speech.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.220]   Then the next hardest is text. Writing a good
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.220]   blog post or report is kind of hard.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.220]   Anyone here that's used Salesforce, I mean, they try
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.220]   to make it easy but it's painful, right?
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.220]   I can feel physical pain.
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.220]   Maybe that's a bit weird to me.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.220]   But then image is the most difficult thing.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.220]   Like creating this just a little bit
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.220]   ago, none of us would have imagined that we
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.220]   could have done it except for a few
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.220]   because, you know, we didn't quite have the tools.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.220]   But now visual communication, be it
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.220]   a PowerPoint presentation, glad to
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.220]   be an investor in Tome, for example,
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.220]   and a partner, is
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.220]   available to everyone, be it this, be it
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.220]   illustration, other things. That's why
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.220]   Bill Gates, you know, he said AI is going
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.220]   to be the hottest topic. It's as important as the PC
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.220]   as the internet. Now I've been
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.220]   lucky enough to talk to some of the leaders and again
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   they're all on this, like Jeff versus Tommy, it was
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.220]   as important as fire. And I was like
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.220]   tablets? He was like no, proper fire. I was like cool.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.220]   [Laughter]
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   You know? And so I think I've seen this
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.220]   repeated again and again because everyone
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.220]   feels that we're at this peak.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.220]   Actually one of the most interesting things is this.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.220]   When I talk to some of the smartest
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.220]   people in the world, because it's always good to talk to people
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.220]   smarter than you, it's a case of
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.220]   a lot of them say the same thing.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.220]   I can't see into the future anymore.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.220]   Because like, for example, Jeff
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.220]   versus Amazon had this amazing thing which is
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.220]   and this is some advice to all the founders,
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.220]   when you're building a great business you
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   have to look at the inevitable and the unchanging.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.220]   Selling books
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.220]   is a way to go onto the full
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.220]   internet because the internet has an advantage
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.220]   on books, but the unchanging is
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.220]   the need for an excellent consumer experience.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.220]   Create great products, right?
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.220]   And so you can kind of see that.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.220]   I see this technology now as an inevitable
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.220]   and I see the unchanging elements
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.220]   but I have no idea where we are a year
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.220]   from now. I don't think anyone here does.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.220]   And if you do, then please give me
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.220]   a call after because I really need some guidance, right?
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.220]   I need some help navigating this.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.220]   Let alone five years, ten years.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.220]   Because we're not following Moore's Law, right?
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.220]   We're not following
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.220]   the exponential. This is
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.220]   why I don't sleep.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   So I need a bit of help with that. This is the number
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.220]   of ML and AI papers
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.220]   on Archive each month. It's a literal
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.220]   exponential. Now 80% of that
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   is foundation model AI
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.220]   which is a bit crazy, right?
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.220]   It's because what we're getting is
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.220]   network effects because these models are good enough, fast
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.220]   enough and cheap enough. And so you're
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.220]   seeing everything everywhere
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.220]   all at once. You know, this is also hands,
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.220]   right? Hands are difficult.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.220]   With people kind of having
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.220]   innovation and sharing it back and forth, using
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.220]   things like 1B
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.220]   and kind of others
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.220]   to keep track using
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.220]   Huggy Face and kind of other great partners.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.220]   I don't think this is going to stop because we're just
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.220]   starting to explore this latent space.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.220]   We're at the iPhone moment. We're not
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.220]   at the iPhone 10 moment.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.220]   Let alone whatever's going to come
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.220]   next. Because we're
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.220]   just starting to do one-to-one interaction.
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.220]   Like we've seen some of this agent-based
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.220]   stuff. We've seen swarms. We've seen all of this.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.220]   But we're still one-to-one
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.220]   with this technology. And I think the most
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.220]   exciting thing is yet to come as we scratch
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.220]   past that surface and we really dig inside.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.220]   But we need the right building blocks
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.220]   for it because again you need to make sense
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.220]   of this chaos, you know.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.220]   Even as the Internet took the cost
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.220]   of information to nothing and
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.220]   generative AI took the cost of creation
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.220]   to nothing.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.220]   This is amazing.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.220]   The way that these models
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.220]   are really
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.220]   good at
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.220]   occasionally going off their meds.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.220]   Think about yourself. Think about
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.220]   companies that help
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.220]   your own lives. What would you do
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.220]   if you had an army of really
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.220]   talented grads that occasionally go off their meds?
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.220]   You'd get them to watch each other.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.220]   You'd get them to understand each other.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.220]   And that's where the disruption happens because a really talented grad
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.220]   is really hard to find. These models are
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.220]   really good at following instructions.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.220]   You know, like the new
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.220]   32,000 token context
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.220]   window version of GPT-4, that's
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.220]   like 20,000 words, like 50 pages
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.220]   of writing or something. But anyway,
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.220]   it's a lot, you know. That's the entire instruction
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.220]   manual that follows it. But here's the
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.220]   other interesting thing. Organizations
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.220]   are slow dumb AI that optimize
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.220]   and turn us into these automatons.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.220]   School is basically child care
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.220]   mixed with a social status game mixed with
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.220]   a Petri dish.
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.220]   And they're designed to take away our creativity
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.220]   and tell us we cannot
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.220]   be creative. All of you that had
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.220]   graduate jobs, you were told, "Do not be creative
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.220]   because you need experience first."
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.220]   And we start out creative, have it
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.220]   knocked out of us, and then we're allowed to be
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.220]   creative later on. Until then
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.220]   we're told to consume.
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.220]   This is something that I think is just a super interesting
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.220]   kind of paradigm.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:55.220]   [inaudible]
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.220]   When you actually use them properly,
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.220]   in my opinion, what you do
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.220]   is you're saying, "I use GPT
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.220]   4 to combat me on various things." I'm like,
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.220]   "You are a really good
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.220]   answerer who does constructive
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.220]   criticism, but you're not afraid
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.220]   to be direct." And then I
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.220]   just get to challenge my assumptions and priors.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.220]   And it's awesome. You know? Because it's a bit
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.220]   lonely being a CEO. It's also a really good therapist.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:19.220]   You know? I have to say,
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.220]   no judgment from it. Unless you tell
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.220]   it to be judgy, in which case it's really judgy.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.220]   [laughter]
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.220]   I think this is one of the interesting things, because when you have the
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.220]   base deep learning models, they start
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.220]   off incredibly creative.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.220]   Hallucinations are not hallucinations.
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   Stable diffusion took
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.220]   100,000 gigabytes of images, and the output
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.220]   was a 2 gigabyte file. That is not
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.220]   compression. If it's compression, then I'm currently
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.220]   worth a trillion dollars, you know?
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.220]   Better than Pied Piper and all that.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.220]   Instead, what it is, is principle understanding
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.220]   and following.
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.220]   It's this creative element that was
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.220]   unprecedented, the ability to do principle-based
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.220]   action. Again, something like a GPT-4 is
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.220]   trillions of parameters that fits on
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.220]   a couple of GPUs. And so, I think
[00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:01.220]   maybe we're looking at the wrong things here, because we're trying to
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.220]   get them into expert systems. So, we
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.220]   take these really smart
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.220]   graphs that occasionally go off their meds. We feed
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.220]   it with junk food, and then we
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.220]   RLHF it back to being human.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.220]   You know? Like, they look a bit disheveled, and you have to tidy it up,
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   and then you bring it back. You know?
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.220]   You bulk, then cut. So, I've bulked, and now I need to cut.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.220]   You know? Whereas,
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.220]   maybe, actually, the future is going to be
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.220]   more and better free-range
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.220]   organic models.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:27.220]   Models that we feed better stuff for certain
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.220]   purposes, because how many of
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.220]   you have ever seen a generalized system
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.220]   that outperforms a specialized system?
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   There's not many cases of that, eh?
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.220]   But a lot of this impetus was AGI
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.220]   scaling. Now we see the measured behavior,
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.220]   and now we go from research to engineering.
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.220]   And we do this at a time
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.220]   whereby, I mean, it's insane.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.220]   Like, GPT-4 can
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.220]   pass all these exams, right? It's like
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.220]   someone's going to strap this thing to a robot, and it will go to Stanford.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.220]   You know?
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.220]   And probably do better than just about everyone there.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.220]   The exception is, like,
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.220]   English literature.
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.220]   It's still pretty bad at AP English Lit.
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.220]   But bar exam, medical license exam, others are there.
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:05.220]   And so, even though
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.220]   we've taken this hacky approach to it,
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.220]   we have expert systems that fit on
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.220]   single GPUs, which is
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   a crazy advancement in our society.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.220]   But, where is the
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.220]   lower limit?
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.220]   Where is the minimum number of tokens,
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.220]   models, model sizes,
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.220]   data? We haven't hit that engineering thing yet.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.220]   And you saw that with stable diffusion.
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.220]   It was released out to the world,
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.220]   and you went from six seconds on an A100
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.220]   to now you're moving to
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.220]   consistently models, distillation, and others.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.220]   Multiple images a second. It works on an iPhone.
[00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:37.220]   You saw that with Lama release.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.220]   You know? Which is basically Meta's
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.220]   model that they released recently on language
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.220]   models. They got it working on a MacBook.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.220]   And you're like, "That's a bit crazy, right?"
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.220]   It works on a MacBook.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.220]   But then we don't know what this lower limit is, because
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.220]   a lot of the model trainings we can only do once.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.220]   But now with the exponential compute,
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.220]   more talent, more people doing it, we will
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.220]   explore these latent spaces better.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.220]   You know? And again,
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.220]   this is essential because even
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.220]   though there are these hacky things, it's important now.
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.220]   Like, I mean, look at this.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.220]   Like, coders are like
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.220]   half the time increasing productivity.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.220]   50% of all code
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.220]   on GitHub now is AI generated.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.220]   I don't think we have programmers in
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.220]   five years as we have now. But that's because
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.220]   we don't have people doing macro media flash anymore.
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:21.220]   When I started as a developer
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.220]   21 years ago,
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.220]   God, I'm 40 now.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.220]   30 plus 10, I would like to think about it.
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.220]   We didn't
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.220]   even have GitHub. We just had subversion
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.220]   coming out. Programming is a change
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.220]   and it will continue to change because programming is just a way
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.220]   to talk to computers. And computers
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.220]   can understand our intentions now with this much
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:41.220]   better. But then again, this is happening
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.220]   across knowledge society. And again,
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.220]   it's just like having a team of
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.220]   really good grads who can program.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.220]   Think about it in this frame as you build
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.220]   products, as you integrate it, as you use it in your
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.220]   own life. And I think it's probably the best frame of reference
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.220]   you can get.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.220]   So, open source.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.220]   You hear like second source.
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.220]   [Applause]
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.220]   So, I think open
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.220]   is super interesting here. You know, we had
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.220]   stable diffusion. It was a collaboration between
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:09.220]   ourselves, RunwayML, and kind of
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.220]   this lab, Robin,
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.220]   Andreas, and Dominic, who are the
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.220]   lead authors of the latent diffusion paper.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.220]   All at stability. If you look at my
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.220]   Twitter, their work last year at NVIDIA
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.220]   on high resolution video models just
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.220]   came out. There's some crazy stuff coming.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.220]   We're going to have full movies in
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.220]   a few years generated from this.
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.220]   I think people have seen it go from
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.220]   kind of blobs to just these things almost
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.220]   instantly. And interestingly,
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.220]   you know, we're moving from this to kind of
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.220]   full control. Because you want to be
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.220]   able to control outputs to
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.220]   get to what you want. And so,
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.220]   I think what we saw first was just this zero
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.220]   shot stuff. And the copyright office was like, "You can't
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.220]   copyright that. It's too easy." And I agree.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.220]   But then, what you're moving to is full
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.220]   control of all pixels. So,
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.220]   we have stable diffusion Excel. We have control net. We have
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.220]   all these things. But who cares about the technology?
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.220]   Because what you care about is the
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.220]   interface and the usability.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.220]   I've got something in my mind, and
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.220]   I want to bring it onto the screen.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.220]   Give people the tools and the agency
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.220]   and they become happier. That's why the mission
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:09.220]   of our company is to build a foundation to
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.220]   activate humanity potential.
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.220]   You know? And our tagline is make people
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.220]   happy. And we do this through agencies, through giving
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.220]   people the models that they can use.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.220]   And you know, you need to do this
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.220]   in a way that I think is a bit different.
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.220]   Because it's a new type
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.220]   of programming primitive. Stable
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:27.220]   diffusion, the language models, image models,
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.220]   all these things. They are a file
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.220]   that, again, stable diffusion is 2 gigabytes.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.220]   And it
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.220]   was 4 of the top 10 apps on the app store
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.220]   in December. That's pretty much the entire backend.
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.220]   Lens and things like that. What can you do
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.220]   when you can put a few words in and you get
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.220]   a stormtrooper out?
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.220]   That's a bit different. I like to think of it, again,
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.220]   framing as a game engine.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.220]   Like you look at the Wii U at the start to Breath of the
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.220]   Wild at the end. You look at all the amazing
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.220]   things people have fine-tuned on these models.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.220]   Once you understand that latent space
[00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:57.220]   better, you can do it. But do we need to have
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:59.220]   2 billion images? No.
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.220]   Do we need to use web scrapes? I think
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.220]   we need to use web scrapes.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.220]   We need to use web scrapes.
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.220]   We need to use web scrapes.
