[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   A podcast listener named Greg writes in to talk about missions and the value of our vocations.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.480]   He asks this, "Pastor John, it is obvious that you have a passion for missions.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.240]   It is also obvious that you believe work and vocations are important aspects of the Christian
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.600]   life. What is puzzling to me is when you state in your book, 'Let the Nations Be Glad,' that
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.040]   missions is the second greatest human activity. Does this not posit a kind of hierarchy of human
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.960]   action which puts ordinary work lower on the rung of human activity? For example, being an artist or
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.160]   a janitor is not as great as being a missionary, and therefore not as great in God's eyes. Moreover,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.560]   doesn't this statement about missions render most of humans and human activity as not engaging in
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.920]   the second greatest human activity? After all, most Christians are not missionaries and do not,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.280]   cannot, spend most of their waking hours engaging in missions. What I'm concerned about is your
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.840]   statement concerning missions leading to a kind of spiritual hierarchy in which missionaries are
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.280]   engaged in the second greatest human activity while the rest of us are not. What would you say
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.760]   to Greg?" It might be helpful first to give the context for the quote in "Let the Nations Be Glad"
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   and explain what I was getting at there. That might remove some of the stumbling block. But
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.760]   then I do want to raise the question of whether Greg means that no distinction
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.360]   should ever be made in the way various vocations or tasks are honored. So here's the quote from
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.080]   "Let the Nations Be Glad." William Carey and thousands like him have been moved and carried
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   by the vision of a great and triumphant God. That vision must come first. Savoring it in worship
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.600]   precedes spreading it in missions. All of history is moving toward one great goal, the white,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.840]   hot worship of God and his son among all the peoples of the world. Missions is not that goal.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   It is the means. For that reason, it is the second greatest human activity in the world, end quote.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:19.440]   So the point was to distinguish the ultimate goal of life from the secondary means to attain it.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   The ultimate goal of human existence is authentic, heartfelt, white, hot worship of God among the
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:35.200]   nations. Missions is not that, and so is not the greatest activity. It is secondary. It is means.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.040]   So calling it the second greatest activity wasn't aimed at ranking it above teaching algebra,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.480]   but below worship. So now the question is whether preaching the gospel to an unreached people group
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.360]   at the risk of your life is in some sense a greater activity than teaching algebra or pastoring a
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:06.480]   local church like I did. That's still the question. My bias is to rank risk-taking missions among
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.080]   unreached peoples above my ministry, but let's think about it. Greg asked this,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:21.680]   "Does this not posit a kind of hierarchy of human action which puts ordinary work lower on the rung
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.120]   of human activity? For example, being an artist or a janitor is not as great as being in mission
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   work and therefore not as great in God's eyes." So the question in front of us is, should we ever
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:44.720]   ascribe a kind of greatness to one human activity over another? And if so, in what sense and why?
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.000]   So to answer that, let's put a couple of Bible verses in front of us. 1 Timothy 5, 17, "Let the
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.760]   elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.320]   preaching and teaching." Another one, 1 Thessalonians 5, 12, "We ask you, brothers, to
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:17.440]   respect or honor, recognize those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:26.800]   and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves."
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:38.160]   So it seems to me that at least in some sense it is fitting and right to describe some roles or
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:47.280]   activities or vocations as having a certain kind of honor or esteem that other roles or activities
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.120]   don't have. For example, if the President of the United States comes to visit you in your house,
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:05.200]   you will probably think of some ways of showing a special regard that you would not have thought of
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.280]   if one of your friends drops by or even say the city councilman who lives in the neighborhood.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:20.080]   So I think what we need to do is start making some distinctions and ask, okay, in what sense
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.800]   is one vocation or one human activity greater than another? Because we know from the Bible
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.240]   that there is an evil way to make distinctions. There is an evil ranking of people. James 1:9,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:46.880]   "Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation and the rich in his humiliation,
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.520]   because like a flower of the grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with its scorching heat
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.640]   and withers the grass. Its flower falls, its beauty perishes. So will the rich man fade away
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.320]   in the midst of his pursuits." And Galatians 3:28, "There's neither Jew nor Greek. There's neither
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:16.160]   slave nor free." Those are pretty radical distinctions in role. "There is no male or
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.920]   female. You're all one in Christ." Now that's the truth that Greg has taken hold of and wants to
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:32.320]   make sure that we don't lose. And you add to the equality that we have in Christ, equally adopted,
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:40.960]   fellow heirs of God, which is astonishing. You add to that the truth that a task, nevertheless,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:50.080]   can be measured in various ways. So example, "Compare the preparation and delivery of a sermon
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:57.280]   to unbelievers in a hostile missionary setting. Compare that with the preparation and delivery
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.360]   of an algebra lesson to a class of compliant teenagers in a Christian school." Now, how do
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.480]   we compare those two activities? The truth that Greg is fastening on, and it is exactly right,
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:19.120]   and crucial to grasp, is that the act of faithfulness in the preparation and delivery
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:27.200]   of the sermon and the algebra lesson may be exactly the same, the faithfulness. Or
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.560]   there may be more faithfulness, more trust, more devotion, more humility in the preparation and
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.280]   delivery of the algebra lesson than in the preparation and delivery of the sermon.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:48.640]   There's the crucial truth that no activity in and of itself is a greater activity in the measure of
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:58.480]   its worship and devotion and faith than any other if you just consider that, the devotion,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:05.440]   the worship, the faithfulness. And when God rewards any activity, it will be on the basis of our
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.400]   faithfulness in the activity, not the fruits, not the effect of it. So measured in that way,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:20.880]   the algebra lesson might be the greater activity than the sermon to the hostile, unreached people,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.560]   namely the algebra teacher did it with greater trust, greater humility, greater faithfulness.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:34.960]   However, aren't there aspects about the preparation and delivery of the sermon in
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.920]   the pursuit of the salvation of sinners among a hostile audience, which are more significant,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:49.760]   greater than the preparation and delivery of that algebra lesson? First, I think of the subject
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.160]   matter is more exalted, closer to ultimate reality. Algebra is good. Algebra is God's
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.040]   creation. Algebra is needed, but algebra is not the gospel and algebra does not save sinners.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.480]   The gospel does. And the teaching of that algebra lesson may be done in greater faithfulness than
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.680]   the preaching of the sermon, but the likelihood of miracles of eternal significance happening
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:21.280]   are greater in the preaching of the sermon and the risking of life is also greater in that audience.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:29.440]   So at least for myself, as a pastor for 33 years, who was basically surrounded by people who loved
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.200]   and approved me and who paid me well in a society that didn't put me in jail,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.440]   in a city with ample medical care, central air conditioning, functioning infrastructures.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:48.000]   In view of all of that, I have always felt that missionaries who have taken more risks,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.240]   going to harder places, enduring greater trials with less affirmation are worthy of a kind of
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:04.320]   esteem and honor of which I am not worthy. I think that's true. And when I say that,
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:10.880]   I'm not belittling the value of my 33 years in ministry. I believe it was honorable. I believe
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:22.400]   it was a gift of God, but it did not have some of the aspects of worth and honor that some missionary
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:30.560]   activities have. And I hope all of us can make those kinds of distinctions. I hope we can
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:40.480]   happily recognize a double or a triple honor activity when it happens and give that greater
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.760]   honor and in no way feel like our life is being minimized.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.720]   That's a good biblical balance. Thank you, Pastor John. You can check out Pastor John's book on this
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.880]   topic, Let the Nations Be Glad, The Supremacy of God in Missions. It's a book that has proven to be
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.120]   immensely valuable and life-defining for a number of missionaries now out in the field.

[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:13.520]   Pastor John and I return on Wednesday to hear from a student who wants to be a missionary in
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.920]   his school. He wants to know some practical ways for beginning to approach his classmates with a
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.880]   missional purpose. What would Pastor John do and what would he suggest? We'll find out on Wednesday.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.880]   I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.280]   author and pastor John Piper. We'll see you then.
