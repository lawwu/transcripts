[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:13.980]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.400]   where someone told us it was our 100th episode last week
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.640]   and we totally missed it.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.920]   - No, no, no, today's our 100th.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.680]   - Oh, today is, oh, I thought it was last week.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.520]   Sean said it was last week, okay.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.800]   He can't count, good thing we have someone
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.720]   who can't count in the finance department.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   Today's show is sponsored by our friends at Bird Dogs.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.000]   I think it's been our most,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.200]   you said they've sponsored the most amount of shows.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400]   I just got a new shipment from Bird Dogs last week.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.440]   I got my first pair of these stretch khaki pants.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.980]   They're lovely, it's the same material,
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.160]   but they look a little better,
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.700]   might be a little thicker, I think.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.440]   Still have the side pocket, I'm wearing some today.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.080]   I opted for the light gray.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.680]   - I like the Phil Gates there, I gotta get the Phil Gates.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.400]   - They're very nice, they look nice.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.720]   I feel like if, I don't golf, but if you did golf,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.280]   these are the kind of pants you could wear golfing.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040]   Also, I have the Bird Dogs polo on.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.720]   It's very nice, breathable, stretchy, it's pretty good.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.040]   - You also still got my hat that I'll get one day?
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.400]   - Yes, you can still get this.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.320]   Put the code in ATC, or go to birddogs.com/ATC.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.880]   You can still get this, before Duncan.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.720]   I like it.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.200]   It's coming your way, that'll be your Christmas present.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.640]   Birddogs.com/ATC for more.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.080]   So I figure, so we've done 100 episodes now.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.320]   I figure we do five questions per show.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800]   That's 500 questions that we've answered.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.640]   That's a lot.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.960]   And we have a dock full of probably 100 questions
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.800]   we haven't answered yet.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.080]   Most of them are probably because they're too long.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.180]   If you wanna get on the show, brevity is the key.
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.480]   We appreciate all the details, but give us a TLDR.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.100]   So yeah, we've done a lot of them.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.280]   Also, last week, people got mad at me
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.480]   because we called the show What's in Ben's Portfolio,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.560]   and they said Ben didn't really tell us
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.240]   what's in his portfolio.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.080]   I don't know, I didn't know--
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.920]   And you're in luck.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.720]   This week, we're gonna screen share his Schwab account.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.480]   I didn't know everyone wanted a fund by fund.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.400]   The funds don't matter to them.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   I mean, I'd say 60% index funds, 40% factor funds.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   How's that, is that close enough?
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.480]   I don't know.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.640]   No one cares about the fund tickers.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.680]   It's funds you would think. People wanna hear tickers.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.780]   We wanna hear tickers, Ben.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.840]   Yeah, it's boring stuff, but close enough.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.800]   That's all you're gonna get, people.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.680]   I like, we have viewers who know me well enough
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.000]   that the other day when the market was rallying,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.680]   all the stocks had been beaten down, were soaring.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   Someone was like, "Your portfolio's doing really well today
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.520]   "in the Dunkin'."
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.280]   I was like, "Yep, it is."
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.360]   We won't talk about the screen share,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.320]   the screenshot you sent me
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.880]   of your total portfolio performance.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.720]   We're gonna leave that one--
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.560]   That's just one IRA, to be fair.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.640]   But yes, yes, I picked like 20 stocks,
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.340]   and they're all down, so yes.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.180]   All right.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.880]   That was the thing.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   Go to the first question.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.440]   I'm gonna show you why that's probably the case.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.560]   Yeah, okay.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.360]   First up, we have a question from Steve.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.540]   I keep hearing that the Magnificent Seven stocks
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.000]   are carrying the stock market this year.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.160]   Does this matter?
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.360]   I get that these stocks could fall
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.960]   and bring the market down with them,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.400]   but should we be worried about this level of concentration?
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.320]   So it's changed-- This is a common question.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.480]   We're getting this a lot these days.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.360]   Yes, and this has been in the news a lot.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.680]   So Magnificent Seven is Apple, Amazon, Facebook,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.640]   not Meta, Google, not Alphabet,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.940]   Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.520]   Those stocks are carrying the market this year.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.440]   I looked yesterday.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.560]   It's kind of mind-boggling,
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.760]   especially when you consider how big these stocks really are.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.780]   The average market cap for these seven companies
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.360]   is $1.6 trillion.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.300]   The average return this year for those companies
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.120]   is 106% in 2023.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.440]   And some of that is Nvidia being up like 240%,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.320]   but even the median gain for these seven stocks
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.880]   is like 75%.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.600]   The average market cap for the remaining stocks
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.560]   in the S&P 500.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.680]   Some people say it's 493.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.080]   It's really like 497 or something,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.400]   'cause I think there's 504 stocks
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.360]   if you count the double-share classes.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.960]   Whatever, I digress.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   The average return of the rest of those stocks,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.200]   which the average market cap is like 57 billion,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.640]   is a return of 4% this year.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.240]   And the S&P, as of this airing,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.680]   is up like 19% on the year, close to it.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.720]   So those stocks really are carrying the water
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.640]   for the rest of the market.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.920]   Now, people worry about this dynamic,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.320]   'cause as Steve said in the question,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.640]   what if these general stocks just roll over, right?
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.400]   They make up close to 30% of the index.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.760]   Apple and Microsoft themselves,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.600]   I looked it up this morning,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.120]   make up 15% of the S&P 500,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.960]   which is huge.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.800]   So this is a legitimate concern.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.960]   If these stocks crash,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.000]   you'd think the market would fall as well.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.120]   But the rest of the market can actually do better
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.200]   in that situation as well.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.600]   They don't have to crash, too.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.720]   So we don't have to go back that far
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.560]   to see how this played out.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.880]   In 2022, one of the reasons these stocks
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.720]   are doing well this year
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.200]   is 'cause they did crappy last year.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.960]   The average return for these seven stocks last year,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.360]   Duncan, what was it?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.640]   What's your guess?
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.480]   - Last year?
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.120]   - Yeah, average return for these seven stocks in 2022.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.360]   - Down 9%.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   - They were down 46% on average.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.320]   Okay, so yeah, they're up 100% on average this year.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.560]   They're down four, guess what?
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.520]   They round tripped.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.080]   If you go 2022 and 2023,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.960]   if you're down 50 and up 100, you break even.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.360]   - See, these names, I don't follow them.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.760]   They're too big and respectable.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.960]   Yeah, so I just don't pay attention to them.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.800]   - Yeah, that place is too busy.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.200]   No one goes there anymore.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.760]   So Nvidia, Tesla, and Facebook and Amazon
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.240]   were all down 50% or worse.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.360]   Every single one of these stocks
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.960]   underperformed the index last year.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.160]   So yeah, they're doing great this year,
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.840]   but last year, and the S&P was down 18% last year.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.280]   Again, these stocks on average were down almost 50%.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.280]   The S&P was down 18, so these stocks did crash.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.880]   - Which was the worst out of those?
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.560]   - Nvidia, I think Nvidia and Tesla were down 60%
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.440]   or something.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.960]   So the other parts of the market picked up a slack.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.640]   However, and I'm not gonna guarantee
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   that's gonna happen again,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.360]   but that tends to be what happens.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.520]   In certain market environments, other stocks do well.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.280]   So I think if you want to be invested in the stock market,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.120]   you have to be comfortable with concentrated gains
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.280]   in the hands of a few stocks though.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.160]   So my favorite study on this was Hendrik Bessenbinder
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.000]   from Arizona State.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.440]   I've mentioned this before, throw up the graphic.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.720]   He did, he asked the question,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.240]   do stocks outperform treasury bills?
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.920]   He has this really cool graphic that shows everything.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   He found 86% 86 stocks going back to 1926.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.240]   And there's been like 26,000 stocks in total
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.760]   that have come and gone since then.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.120]   86 stocks accounted for half of all wealth creation
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.360]   in the United States stock market going back to 1926.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.640]   All of that wealth creation came from 4% of the stocks.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.880]   60% of the stocks failed to beat T-bills
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.120]   over their lifetime.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.340]   And the other close to 40% barely beat T-bills.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.180]   So most stocks don't do all that well over the long run.
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.400]   It's just a handful of stocks
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.040]   that account for most of the gains.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.560]   Of course, this is like a hundred years of data.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.960]   So plenty of stocks over this time
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.880]   had fantastic returns over shorter timeframes.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.980]   You can take the thing off of there.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.520]   But my biggest takeaway from his research is,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.280]   it would be wonderful if you could just pick these stocks,
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.800]   but most people can't, right?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.280]   Apple was close to going out of business in the 1990s
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.000]   until Microsoft and Bill Gates gave them a lifeline
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.100]   and gave them a loan.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.600]   And now Apple's the biggest company in the US stock market.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.640]   It's kind of crazy to think about,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.360]   but the biggest takeaway here is that diversification
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.080]   is what matters because you want to give yourself
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.980]   a wide enough net to cast
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.280]   so that you can actually own these winners.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.480]   So if you have a concentrated portfolio,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.980]   yeah, I'm going to be Warren Buffett.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.200]   Actually, you have a greater chance of underperforming.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.580]   So there's this new paper,
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.720]   and you asked me about this last week.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.760]   It's called the Underperformance
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.360]   of Concentrated Stock Positions from NYU.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.920]   So throw up the chart here.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.320]   This is the distribution of returns over one month,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.960]   one year, five years, 10 years, and 20 years
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.360]   for individual stocks.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.720]   And the further these charts go to the left,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.520]   the more losers there are.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.840]   And what these researchers found
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.460]   is that over all 10-year periods,
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.680]   close to half of all stocks are losers.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.740]   And this works across sectors, too.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.520]   So pick a dart, throw it at the newspaper,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.560]   if they still print stocks in the newspapers, right?
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   You can't really throw a dart at a computer screen.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.160]   But pick any stock in any sector over 10 years,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.240]   and half of them are going to be losers.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.080]   More than half.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.680]   It's like 55%.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.480]   And so fill up the next chart here.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.000]   This shows the sectors.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.840]   This just kind of shows.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.520]   You can see the median return versus the average.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.040]   So the average is really high.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.000]   The median is really low.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.200]   And then it shows the percentage of winners and losers.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.960]   That's because there's a handful of stocks
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.700]   that pretty much pick up the slack for all the losers.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.480]   So the beautiful thing about the stock market
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.280]   is even though there's a lot of losers,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.840]   the winners more than make up for them.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.600]   So what are our lessons here?
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.160]   Outsized gains are normal.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.720]   This year, in a one-year period, it's an outlier.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.960]   But over the long-term, this is the norm in the stock market.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.760]   - When I was getting into the stock market years ago,
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.740]   reading, you know, I read Intelligent Investor
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.300]   and a bunch of, you know, Michael Lewis
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.160]   and all the books people typically recommend.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.560]   And yeah, my takeaway early on was like,
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.320]   you know, if you just pick some stocks
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.800]   and hold onto them long enough, you know, they'll do well.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   And yeah, like now I'm seeing that was not the right takeaway.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.640]   - It is, yeah.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.120]   But this isn't to say that some of these,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.200]   again, this is like hundreds of years of data.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.040]   - Right.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.880]   - So it's not to say that in between small caps--
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.600]   - When Amazon proves this wrong, stuff like that, right?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.960]   Where it's like it crashed down to how low
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.560]   and then came all the way roaring back.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.000]   - Yeah, and like small caps and mid caps
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.840]   have still done well in this time period.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.700]   It's just that some of those stocks that came up to the top
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.280]   were smaller in mid caps before, right?
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.800]   He also found the relative underperformance
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.880]   over rolling 10-year periods increases
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.480]   when considering stocks whose performance
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.600]   is running from the top 20% over the previous five years.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.840]   So like the best performers,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.060]   eventually that momentum peters out.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.680]   So some of these stocks in the Magnificent Seven
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.080]   are going to underperform in the years ahead.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.360]   I don't know which ones.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   I don't know when, I don't know why,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.000]   but it's going to happen.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.200]   That's pretty much the way the stock market works.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   And other stocks to pick up the slack.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.960]   In 2000, some of the biggest stocks in the market
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   were GE, Citigroup, AIG, right?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.700]   All have fallen, some in magnificent fashion.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.540]   And guess what?
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.080]   Other stocks came up and picked up the slack.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.280]   NVIDIA, and Microsoft is the only one
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.360]   that still remains from 2000 as one of the biggest stocks.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.840]   - Well, the question I asked you last week
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.400]   when I was showing you my like 20 stocks in an IRA
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.840]   that are all down significantly over like two years,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.260]   not like over a couple of months,
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.300]   is does this reflect that the exchanges
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.120]   are too lenient with listing requirement?
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.880]   Like are too many bad companies able to list?
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.900]   Is that part of it here?
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.600]   Or does that not have anything to do with it?
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.500]   - No, I think it's always like this, unfortunately.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.340]   - Okay.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.360]   - And that's not to say some of your stocks
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.320]   won't come back.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.160]   - Right.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:35.980]   - Right?
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.200]   It's just that the history of the stock market
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.320]   shows that there's power laws,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.920]   and the gains are typically concentrated
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.000]   in the hands of a few stocks,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.400]   and that's why you wanna cast a wide net.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.200]   And yeah, you can pick some stocks,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.520]   but diversifying is probably gonna be a better bet overall
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.280]   for the majority of your funds,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.120]   because you wanna make sure you have the ability
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.100]   to get those winners, 'cause it's hard to pick 'em.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.940]   - Right.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.880]   - That's where I come down from all this.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.400]   It's hard to pick winners,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.280]   and diversification is the way to ensure
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.640]   that you're gonna own the winners,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.680]   and then those winners are gonna
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.280]   more than cancel out the losers.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.560]   - Also, before we move on,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.960]   John's out today, and so I forgot to set our windows here,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.080]   so I'm gonna flip us around,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.760]   so that people in the chat can--
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.600]   - Oh, and the guy on the left.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.420]   - Can--
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.260]   - The guy on the right, I don't know.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.080]   - Peace.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   - One of those.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.760]   Oh, are people complaining?
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.960]   - Not complaining, just--
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.160]   - That we're on the wrong side?
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.240]   - You know, yeah.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.080]   - Okay.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.340]   - Now all is right in the world.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.520]   - All right, let's do the next one.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.960]   - All right, up next we have a question from Anthony.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.880]   Hi guys, love the show,
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.600]   and appreciate all the information you put out.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.360]   My fiance and I received a wedding gift
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   of $50,000 from her father,
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.520]   and I was wondering what you would do--
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.480]   - Not to brag.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.840]   - Yeah, not to brag.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.960]   And I was wondering what you would do
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.600]   with that money in these unsure times in the market.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.800]   We just bought a house in April,
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.940]   and got married in July.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.360]   We had enough saved to cover the wedding costs.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.840]   We'll likely need some of this money
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.240]   in the future for the house,
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.760]   but we would like to put some of the money
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.080]   to work in the meantime.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.400]   I make around $100,000,
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.280]   and my fiance makes $70,000,
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.860]   but we both have student loans,
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.480]   and a pretty high mortgage to pay.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.520]   Thanks in advance for your help.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.860]   - All right, congrats on the new house,
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.600]   the wedding, marriage. - Nice wedding gift.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.420]   - Nice father-in-law you've got there.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.120]   The personal finance guy in me says,
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.040]   "Well, you fund your emergency savings,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.340]   "you max out your Roth IRA,
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.720]   "and you pay off some student loans.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.160]   "You can do some of that stuff if you want."
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.480]   That amount of money certainly gives you
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.440]   a nice springboard to getting yourself
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.360]   your finances right.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.600]   It probably makes some sense to set aside
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.000]   some money for a house, too.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.960]   When you move to a new place,
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.120]   there's a lot of stuff you end up buying,
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.640]   especially if you haven't been in a house before.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.040]   Furniture, decorations, maybe new TV,
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.640]   tools, landscaping, all that stuff
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.800]   that you have to-- - A mudroom.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.640]   - Pick up.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.800]   Yeah, that's the boring stuff, though.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.160]   Don't get me wrong, the boring stuff is important
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.980]   if you wanna get ahead,
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.360]   but you should also have some fun with it.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.440]   This is a windfall, right?
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.280]   Probably not happening again.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.600]   You're newlyweds.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.800]   I don't know, probably no kids in the house yet.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.720]   Set aside some money to have fun and go on a vacation.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.960]   My wife and I made a point to do that,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.720]   'cause we knew once we had responsibilities
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.560]   and kids were here, we weren't gonna be able
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.380]   to travel as much.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.560]   So we traveled as much as we could after we got married,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.100]   because we knew that part of our life
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.560]   was gonna be much harder to do going forward.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.660]   But I think this is also a good time
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.040]   to set up your bonus asset allocation.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.440]   This is the way I think about this.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.640]   So I got my first bonus for my first job in year two.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.480]   I think it was $300 for my bonus.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.880]   My boss was a little stingy.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.560]   But anytime I got money outside of my regular salary,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.320]   I set up some sort of asset allocation
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.640]   where a certain percentage would go to short-term savings,
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.280]   a certain percentage would go to my travel fund,
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.600]   a certain percentage would go to retirement accounts,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.520]   and then a certain percentage would go to just--
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.400]   - Sports gambling.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.240]   - Frivolous, well, frivolous whatever, spending.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.580]   Buy something for your house, go on a trip,
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.380]   go out to a nice dinner, reward yourself a little bit.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.620]   I think that if you're just gonna save it all,
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.460]   that's kind of boring.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.940]   So I think it's just a good way to keep yourself honest,
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.780]   not throw all the money away.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.220]   Have some sort of rule of thumb
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.620]   anytime you get money in like this.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.940]   And obviously, it might not happen very often,
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.380]   but if you do get some sort of windfall for whatever reason,
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.580]   then you know what to do with it,
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.380]   just like you know how to invest your money
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.380]   with an asset allocation.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.220]   That's the way I think about it.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.500]   - Makes sense. - I'm not gonna give you
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.740]   anything to invest in, but I would worry more
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.580]   about how you're allocating it.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.060]   - I think they want a ticker.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.620]   Can you give a ticker?
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.860]   - Sorry, no tickers.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.640]   - What's the world market fund?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.500]   Just kidding.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.300]   - Someone says YOLO the 50K into 500K.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.840]   We all know you more likely YOLO the 50K into 5K, but.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.680]   - Yeah.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.180]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.380]   - All right, up next we have a question from Kurt.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.420]   So this is what you would do, really, with that money, right?
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.660]   You'd put it into your spreadsheet to keep track of it?
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.500]   - Yes.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.960]   - I think you've mentioned that you track
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.040]   your portfolio investments and other finances
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:30.940]   in a big spreadsheet.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.620]   Can you go into detail on how you have that set up?
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.340]   - We've had a few people ask if I can just share
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.680]   my spreadsheet with them.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.500]   And I keep telling people, like,
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.060]   you're gonna be severely disappointed
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.020]   'cause it's so, so simple.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.060]   I'm a, let's be fair, I'm a simple guy, right?
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.620]   It probably wouldn't be all that helpful to most people.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.780]   So my finance tracking system is just this.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.160]   I use an Excel spreadsheet.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.000]   I have for years.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.820]   It looks like this.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.940]   So net income for the month after taxes
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.100]   and 401(k) contributions and all that stuff.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   And then I list my fixed expenses.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.100]   So it's mortgage, insurance, car payments,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.320]   phone, utility, cable.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.180]   I still have cable.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.100]   Thank you very much.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.440]   - When your cable one goes down over time, right?
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.260]   Because you keep negotiating them down.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.760]   - Yeah, every 12 months.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.600]   And then savings.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.900]   I treat savings like it's a fixed bill, right?
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.500]   Savings are non-negotiable.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.260]   I set IRA, IRA, 401(k), all that stuff.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.300]   Then all the variable expenses go on the credit cards.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.660]   Food, clothing, all the stuff,
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.540]   crap we have to buy for our kids,
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.580]   subscriptions, et cetera.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.200]   All of it goes on a credit card.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.660]   After the variable expenses,
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.020]   like that's basically like my leftover pile, right?
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.040]   So you take the fixed expenses away from that income.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.860]   Variable is what's left over.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.940]   Start with the net income,
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.500]   subtract the fixed, subtract the variable.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.340]   That's it.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.300]   Hopefully it basically zeroes out at the end of the month
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.220]   'cause I should be spending it all.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.380]   That's the Bend budget.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.460]   See how simple that is?
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.700]   It's not like, it's not,
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.700]   I'm not changing the world here.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.300]   My net worth tracker has probably been simpler.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.580]   I have an Excel spreadsheet.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.220]   I've used this for years too.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.900]   So I have all my accounts listed.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.260]   401(k)s, IRAs, 529 plans,
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.860]   brokerage accounts, savings account.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.380]   And I have the funds and the holdings
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.120]   listed under each of those accounts.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.180]   And once a year, I update the market values.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.460]   That's it.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.660]   - See, this is why people tune in
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.220]   for the spreadsheet content.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.620]   - You can build it yourself.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.220]   So I even, just for fun,
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.540]   I added a real estate column a couple of years ago
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.020]   'cause I've got some equity there now.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.840]   Some equity because housing prices have gone up.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.460]   Very simple, old school, doesn't take me very,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.900]   my finances take me 15 minutes a month probably.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.740]   Sometimes more, sometimes less.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.060]   - That's what I was about to ask,
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.260]   how much time this takes you.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.100]   - That's the whole point.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.440]   I have most of this stuff automated
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.380]   so I don't have to spend a ton of time doing it.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.220]   That's how I like it.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.060]   So other people would rather micromanage.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.900]   - I don't know how to use Excel really
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.020]   so this would take me a while to set up probably.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.220]   - There's no formulas here, Duncan.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.060]   It's very easy.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.420]   I'm literally in your numbers.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.260]   - I see. - You can do it.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.100]   I have faith in you.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.860]   - I like my system better
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.220]   where I just see how much is left in the bank account
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.060]   every once in a while.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.540]   - That's probably what most people do though.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.860]   That's the problem with like the,
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.240]   I'll save whatever's left over.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.900]   Sounds great in theory until,
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.880]   there's an old Jerry Seinfeld bit where he says,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.980]   "It's funny how every single day,
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.660]   "the newspaper is completely full
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.980]   "where the amount of news
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.340]   "matches the pages of the newspaper."
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.200]   That's how your spending works too.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.040]   - Right. - Right?
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.300]   You're going to spend whatever's there
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.060]   so if you save first, spend whatever's left, invert.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.320]   - That's true. - Right?
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.900]   - That's, yeah, I like that.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.380]   - All right, next question.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.540]   - All right, up next we have a question from Tony.
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.060]   I'm retired from 20 years on active duty with the Air Force
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.940]   and 10 years as a federal civil servant.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.180]   This is just in time, we just had Veterans Day
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.500]   so thank you for your service.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.940]   - Yeah, thank you for your service, Tony.
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.260]   - I have a pension, social security, VA benefits,
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.820]   and rental income of about $130,000 annually.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.100]   I'm single, age 64, and have two adult sons.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.700]   I have $765,000 in investments.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.640]   Of that, 500,000 is in Roth accounts
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.900]   and 265,000 is in tax-deferred accounts.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.020]   I have nothing in a taxable account.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.360]   I live below my means.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.180]   The first part of this is, in terms of my bond allocation,
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.940]   should I simply own the G fund
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.320]   in the federal government's thrift savings plan
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.220]   and forego other types of bond funds
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.140]   and individual bonds altogether?
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.580]   Do the benefits of the G fund mean I should just stick
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.120]   with that fund and eschew the others?
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.000]   Part two, I'm buying a new Sprinter camper van
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.840]   in a few months.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.180]   It's got all the bells and whistles, all-wheel drive,
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.660]   lithium batteries, solar power, et cetera.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.380]   I've already paid for the chassis and down payment
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.180]   so I've paid about $88,000 in cash.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.700]   I need to come up with about $190,000 more
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.880]   once I pick up the van.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.820]   Should I pay cash for it out of my Roth IRA
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.580]   or should I finance it?
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.420]   - Hey, as a finance guy-- - This is a good one.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.260]   This is a fun one, I like this.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.660]   - This is a good one.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.140]   What's a chassis?
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.060]   - It's like the skeleton of the vehicle.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.260]   - Okay, so he's-- - Basically, yeah.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.100]   - Okay, start.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.660]   Okay, so this, to me, this is an investment question,
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.940]   this is a financial planning question,
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.280]   this is a personal finance question,
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.700]   so let's bring in a financial advisor
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.580]   to help sort through it all.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.740]   Riddleswell's own Alex Palumbo.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.940]   - Hey, Alex.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.380]   - Hey, guys, thanks for having me.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.900]   Ben, great to see ya.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.020]   - Alex, most people on podcasts would say,
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.060]   "There's a lot to unpack here,"
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.800]   but I'm not gonna do that 'cause I'm not cliche.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.140]   But first of all, where I wanted to start here
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.860]   is he said he's got all of his savings,
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.900]   you know, he gets the pension income and rental income,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.300]   but his savings are all in tax-deferred accounts.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.780]   If a client comes to you with all tax-deferred money,
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.580]   does that technically make your life easier
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.580]   from a planning perspective?
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.300]   Does it make it harder 'cause it's less flexible?
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.780]   I'm just curious that there's no taxable money whatsoever.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.460]   Is that a good thing, a bad thing, does it not matter?
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.180]   What do you think?
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.660]   - Yeah, good question, Tony.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.060]   First of all, thank you for your service.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.420]   Duncan mentioned Veterans Day.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.240]   Thanks, Tony.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.120]   To answer your exact question,
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   when clients come with qualified accounts,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.840]   I like it because they're more tax-efficient.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.420]   It also gives us the opportunity
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.960]   to utilize different investment strategies
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.680]   because we can trade as much as we want,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.400]   maximize trading, and there's no tax consequences
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.280]   as opposed to non-qualified accounts
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.000]   where we'd be generating short-term capital gains or losses.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.160]   - That's true, you could change the portfolio allocation
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.240]   if you wanted to without triggering any taxable gains.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.080]   Good point. - Yeah, you can do
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.720]   anything like that.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.800]   In terms of Tony's exact question,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.920]   did you wanna hop into the G Fund question?
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.040]   - Well, let's talk about the G Fund
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.760]   because you asked me about this yesterday,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.760]   and you said, "What is a G Fund?"
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.960]   And I have some experience with this because--
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.280]   - Oh, way to throw me under the bus.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.560]   You know, actually, Ben,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.240]   I'm a very experienced G Fund advisor.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.320]   - Well, I'm guessing a lot of people
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.640]   don't know what this is
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.260]   'cause my brother works for the federal government,
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.880]   and he asked me about this a while ago,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.480]   and there's five funds in this,
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.600]   and I've been pounding the table on this
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.520]   for a number of years that the Thrift Savings Plan
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.160]   or the TSP, which is all federal government retirement plan,
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.280]   that should be open to everyone
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.160]   because, I don't know, 40 or 50% of people
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   have access to a workplace retirement plan.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.640]   This is one administered by the government.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.360]   It has all five index funds.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.640]   Fees are really low,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.720]   but the G Fund is really something else
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.080]   because it, Duncan, throw up the fund comparison.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.020]   So they have two bond funds in this thing.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.520]   So one is the G Fund, one is the F Fund.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.680]   The F Fund is like the Barclays Ag,
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.640]   like a total bond market.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.280]   The G Fund is a treasury fund,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.820]   but the way it works is it acts like a short-term treasury
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.080]   in terms of volatility,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.720]   but the yield it pays is more like long-term treasury.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.200]   So it pays a higher yield, but your principal is protected.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.320]   So you can see over like three years,
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.240]   this thing's outperformed by 7% per year over the aggregate
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.360]   because it doesn't have interest rate risk.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.760]   It acts like a short-term bond fund,
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.440]   but you're earning a higher yield.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.140]   And if this was another fund company
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.240]   that was administering this fund,
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.360]   you'd think it's like some sort of Ponzi scheme,
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.400]   but it's the federal government
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.400]   who's essentially like guaranteeing that it's very,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.280]   it's like it takes an average of all the treasury yields.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.840]   It's very, so what I'm trying to say is like,
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.320]   this thing is a really good deal
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.200]   and you could diversify by having the other one,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.440]   but it's in terms of,
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.080]   you don't have to worry about like rates rising
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.680]   for this thing to hurt you.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.400]   It's through the rising rate environment,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.960]   it's probably one of the best performing bond funds
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.480]   that there is.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.680]   - US government, Ponzi scheme, what's the difference, Ben?
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.000]   You know?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.360]   - No one ever says that, right?
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.760]   - Yeah, the G Fund is good to your point
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.720]   because the value of your account will never fluctuate.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.520]   You simply get the stated interest
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.400]   of long-term fixed income instruments.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.160]   - Yeah, if you look at like the description of this,
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.520]   it sounds too good to be true.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.240]   - Well, the downside is that, there's not much downside,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.880]   but if I had to play devil's advocate, Benjamin,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.200]   it would be that when the yield curve is inverted,
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.160]   you'd be getting the longer term rates,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.520]   which are lower than the shorter term rates,
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.720]   but that's really nitpicking, to be honest.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   The pros are it's super low cost
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.880]   and it's also taxed at ordinary income rates
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.600]   because it's government fixed income.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.520]   However, our boy, Tony, only has qualified accounts,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.120]   so it seems like an appropriate asset class
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.080]   or fund to own within this type of account.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.200]   So overall, Tony, if you're comfortable with it,
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.480]   I think you get the thumbs up from us.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.560]   - Yeah, it's a pretty, it's pretty good.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.880]   So let's say the Sprinter camper van.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.480]   So I'm guessing the Sprinter one is like a shorter camper,
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.080]   smaller one, since he's by himself.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.320]   - It's like one of those oversized vans.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.560]   It's pretty large.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.000]   It's kind of like what some shipping companies use.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.160]   - So Alex, I'm sure you've talked to many clients about this
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.880]   whether it's buying a new car or buying a second home
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.980]   or something like this.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.040]   It's the kind of decision where I can either
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.880]   let my investments ride and borrow some money,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.720]   or I can take it from my portfolio and pay in cash.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.960]   Like the pro, there's obviously pros and cons of each,
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.200]   but how do you help people make this type of decision?
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.880]   'Cause I'm guessing where rates are right now being so high,
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.580]   it's kind of a push in terms of a hurdle rate.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.280]   - Yeah, this is a pretty common overall decision tree
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.040]   and point when I'm working with my clients for sure.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.160]   I say that it always comes down to two things,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.880]   the interest rate and investor behavior.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.840]   If the interest rate that you're getting quoted
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.040]   in terms of financing, the camper, the house,
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.880]   whatever it is, is higher than your expected rate of return
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.280]   on your investments, then it becomes a no-brainer, right?
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.600]   You wanna just pay that off.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.280]   You don't wanna finance the camper.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.440]   If you're getting quoted a 12% interest rate
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.520]   and you're gonna invest the difference at a 6% rate,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.640]   that doesn't make too much sense.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.440]   And then it comes down to investor behavior.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.960]   So for example, let's say Tony is getting
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.320]   like a 6% interest rate quoted if he finances the camper
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.280]   and he has all this income coming in that he told us about.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.120]   You could probably theoretically say
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.200]   that your overall portfolio should get like a seven
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.000]   or 8% overall rate of return.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   So that's pretty positive rate of return arbitrage.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.760]   However, the investor behavior, right?
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.280]   Like you were just talking about it
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   and actually Tesla was down 65% last year.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.080]   Nvidia down 50%, Amazon down 50%.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.840]   And I was taking a look at this for certain clients.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.320]   This is gonna blow your mind.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.720]   Duncan, keep that hat on
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.240]   'cause your mind's about to be blown.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.440]   Over the past two and a half years
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.520]   before November, this month.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.440]   So from May 1st, '21 to October 31st, '23,
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.200]   the S&P was flat and every single asset class was down,
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.360]   down bad tremendously over that time period.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.080]   That's 630 trading days.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.920]   - Right, so that's the kind of--
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.800]   - Over the past, hold on, Ben.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.480]   Hold on, this is gonna be good, I promise.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.400]   Over the past 13 trading days, just this month of November,
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.160]   every single asset class that we invest for clients
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.320]   has drastically outperformed in 13 days
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.560]   versus the past 630 trading days.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.120]   Most notably, international stocks
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.520]   with a 35% discrepancy in performance
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.560]   and small cap stocks
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.120]   with an over 30% discrepancy in performance.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.960]   - It is crazy.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.480]   - Yeah, what you're trying to say is returns are lumpy,
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.920]   but if you're going through a period like that
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.480]   and you look back and you go,
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.280]   oh shoot, I could have just taken this money out
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.500]   before this crappy period of returns happened
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.560]   and now you're kicking yourself,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.200]   that's like the regret minimization piece
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.360]   you have to think through
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.920]   is will you feel that or will you act on that if you,
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.800]   'cause you don't know what the right decision is gonna be
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.760]   or what the markets are gonna do
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.000]   so you have to kind of be happy with it one way or another
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.800]   and understand why you're doing it.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.840]   - Or even worse, you make this decision to finance,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.680]   you invest, you're like,
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.760]   oh, I can easily beat that 6% benchmark
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.000]   over the next like 30 years, 20 years, 10 years,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.840]   whatever it is.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.680]   Then you go through a period like the past two and a half
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   years and you're like, screw it,
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.840]   I'm just gonna pay it off.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.360]   Now the market's up 8% over the past 10 days
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.280]   and you just completely wrecked your entire portfolio.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.520]   And it's like one decision over three years
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.260]   that can completely destroy, not destroy your finances,
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.940]   but materially impact your lifetime returns.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.840]   - Right, Duncan, I can see you driving
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.080]   one of those Mercedes Sprinter ones.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:14.900]   Is that fair?
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.800]   Like I can see you tooling around Europe
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.640]   in one of those things.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.720]   - Powered by vegetable oil.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.640]   - Yeah, I mean, I'd be down.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.600]   That sounds interesting, sounds fun.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.440]   - By the way--
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.440]   - Be able to go wherever you want, anytime, sounds fun.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.200]   - Sorry, by the way, to answer his question
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.840]   about taking distributions from his Roth IRA,
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.200]   that might be a consideration, right?
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.920]   Because that Roth money is that sweet, sweet, sweet
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.600]   Roth money, as Bill Sweet mentioned,
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.240]   like that's one reason to maybe lean more
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.400]   towards financing it.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   But at the end of the day, Tony, big tone,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.800]   you accumulated half a mil inside of that Roth IRA
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.960]   and what better to spend it, like what,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.560]   30% of it, 40% of it, once you're retired,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.840]   on the Sprinter camper of your dreams?
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.080]   I would say, generally speaking,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.200]   if the interest rate is like 6% to 7%, it's close.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.080]   If it's 5% or lower, you can finance.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.560]   If it's a higher interest rate,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.400]   then I would just pay it off and use that Roth money.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.040]   - It could be like 8% or 9% these days.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.720]   If it's that high, paying it off.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.480]   And you get your living situation taken care of.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.560]   - I think it has to be over 8%, 9%
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.100]   to finance a Sprinter camper, right?
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.700]   - Lastly, if Tony is living below his means,
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.020]   how come he doesn't have any non-qualified assets
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.740]   built up, Tony, huh, huh?
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.780]   - I think it's great that he's got it all tax-deferred.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.900]   This guy knows what he's doing.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.320]   - But he's saying he's living below his means,
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.620]   so if he's bringing in 130K, he's spending 80K,
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.080]   where's that extra 50K going?
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.420]   - The government's Ponzi scheme.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.580]   All right, Duncan, next question.
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.020]   (laughing)
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.880]   - Okay, last but not least, we have a question from Daniel.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.380]   Ben, do you feel like getting an MBA helped your career?
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.980]   Did you pay for it yourself or did an employer help?
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.980]   I'm mulling over starting an online MBA
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.240]   from a public university, but I've been hearing
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.180]   that it's not worth the time or money.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.980]   I was hoping to get your perspective, thanks.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.480]   - Getting an MBA did help my career,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.580]   but not the way I thought it would.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.680]   - I gotta be honest, you need to talk this up more.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.220]   I actually didn't even remember you had an MBA.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.060]   - Exactly.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:27:59.880]   - This should be on your signature and stuff.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.720]   - I'm not gonna be a LinkedIn guy
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.180]   that puts Ben Carlson, MBA, after it, sorry.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.700]   - 100% it should be what you do.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.020]   - No way.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.680]   My employer had a reimbursement plan up to a certain level,
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.300]   and I went to a local university,
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.200]   so it wasn't that expensive.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.820]   And I think they probably covered 90% of the cost.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.180]   And I was at a career crossroads
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.740]   where I knew I wanted to do something different.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.500]   And actually, I started my blog, A Wealth of Common Sense,
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.420]   while in my MBA program in one of the classes.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.860]   So if I wouldn't have done that,
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.060]   I don't know if I would've started my blog
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.220]   and I wouldn't be here today.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.780]   So it helped me in that way.
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.340]   But I don't know, I didn't learn much in my master's program
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.460]   that I couldn't have learned by reading books.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.900]   I think it's a good decision if you can get
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.940]   into a really good school, if you're stuck in your career
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.300]   and just want to figure something new out.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.180]   It's also really helpful to build your network
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.320]   if you don't have a network in terms of helping
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.680]   for upward job mobility.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.660]   So those are the reasons I think you should do it.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.520]   I don't think you should do it if you think it's gonna mean
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.200]   like a springboard to your career automatically.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   I think it guarantees you all that much.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.680]   Alex?
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.520]   - Yeah, agreed.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.800]   I think you phrased it nicely.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.000]   It might add value to your overall situation,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.560]   but most likely in ways that you didn't see it, right?
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.240]   Like why are you getting the MBA in the first place?
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.420]   To get a job or become an entrepreneur
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.580]   that you otherwise couldn't get without the MBA.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.760]   In 99% of circumstances, real life experience
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.120]   trumps education in the classroom.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.280]   - Yes, I think if you had to, like I know people stop
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.720]   and do a full-time program.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   I would only do that if it's like one
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.560]   of the top 10 universities or something.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.040]   If not, I would keep working.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.280]   - Online is a little tricky too,
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.880]   just because so much of the point of a degree like that
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.300]   is the connections you're making and people you're meeting
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.040]   and that could end up being great relationships
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:34.960]   for you to have down the road.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.300]   I don't know that you get that as much with an online degree.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.380]   - And also, would you go to the brightest and best,
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.420]   AKA the most expensive?
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.660]   Now look what you've done, Ben.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.060]   You're two years out of the workforce.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.660]   You have zero more experience.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.220]   You're 150K in debt,
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.220]   and you didn't make any money over those two years.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.780]   Most likely, the reason that you, whoever asked this question
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.740]   or just someone making this debate,
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.660]   that you can't get the job you want
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.860]   is not because of whether you have an MBA or not.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.540]   That's just the fact, right?
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.120]   No one's gonna interview you, really like you,
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.440]   think you're capable, and then say,
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.640]   "Well, you actually don't have an MBA."
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.320]   If you think the MBA will get you that interview,
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.400]   then sure, go for it,
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.240]   but that's a heavy price to pay,
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.680]   both financially and period of your life,
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.400]   just to hope to get a better interview
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.120]   while gaining zero more life experience.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.400]   - I would wanna know what the career prospects are
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.000]   and if there's jobs you're looking for that require an MBA.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.040]   Like if there's a job you really want that requires it,
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.640]   then you think about it, I think.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.360]   But if it's not really required,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.480]   I don't think it, I wouldn't put so much weight on it.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.120]   - I'm banking on one day getting an honorary MBA, you know?
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.880]   That's what I want.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.820]   - Think of what happened here.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.680]   I was hired on a three-month internship
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   as a gadget guy, eight years ago.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.160]   They didn't hire me 'cause I had an MBA.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.720]   In fact, I'd imagine we interviewed much more qualified
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.340]   and more well-polished candidates,
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.180]   but at the end of the day,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.700]   people just want to work with people that they like.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   That's why we put Ben in Ann Arbor, Michigan
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.860]   and me all the way in New Jersey,
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.540]   so we're not even close to one another.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.560]   - Alex basically worked his way up from the mailroom.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.800]   - It's true.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.920]   - I mean, I'm not in Ann Arbor, but close.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.960]   - An intern to director of glow-ups.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.900]   Wow, oh my God, that's not even why I made this my name.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.740]   There you go, Duncan.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.440]   See, full circle, baby.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.540]   - Yeah, that's a reference to our Fantasy Football League.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.920]   Alex's first place.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.420]   - First place at a 16, nine-game winning streak,
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.260]   not to brag, Ben.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.840]   - People want to hear less about your fantasy football team
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.360]   than they want to hear about Duncan's stock picks.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.040]   I'm just putting that out there.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.980]   - There's a lot of appetite for my stock picks.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.380]   - Congratulations on the 100th episode, guys.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.860]   Very impressive, everything you've done.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.780]   You're giving the YouTube base the knowledge that they need.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.220]   And thank you for having me on this very special episode.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.820]   - Thanks for coming on, Alex.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.260]   Tune in tomorrow, brand new episode

[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.400]   We're off, we'll see you in two weeks.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.880]   - Happy Thanksgiving.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   - See you, everyone.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.320]   (upbeat music)

[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.180]   you
