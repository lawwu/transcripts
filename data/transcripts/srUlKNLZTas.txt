[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   I mean, I've definitely experienced moments
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.440]   where I didn't want to do anything but chess.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.040]   - I'd also say that's pretty universal.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.400]   I think if you wanna be the best at anything you do
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.000]   or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.160]   - The following is a conversation
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.480]   with Alexandra and Andrea Botez.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.120]   They're sisters, professional chess players,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.920]   commentators, educators, entertainers, and streamers.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.120]   Their channel is called Botez Live on Twitch and YouTube.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.960]   I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.640]   A small side note about the currently ongoing controversy
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.560]   in the chess world, where the 19-year-old grandmaster,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.960]   Hans Nieman, beat Magnus Carlsen at the Sinkfield Cup.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960]   After this, Magnus, for the first time ever,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.480]   withdrew from the tournament,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.360]   implying with a tweet that there may have been cheating
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840]   or at least something shady going on.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.560]   Folks like the grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.120]   fanned the flames of cheating accusations
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.320]   and the internet made a bunch of proposals
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.400]   on how the cheating could have been done.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.040]   And it ranged from the ridiculous to the hilarious,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.000]   often both.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.520]   Hans himself came out and said that he has cheated before
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.480]   when he was 12 and 16 on random online games
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.400]   to jack up his rating.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.280]   But he said that he has never cheated
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.240]   in person over the board.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   Danny Wrench from chess.com, who I've spoken with,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.660]   may make a statement in response to Hans's claims soon.
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.800]   Folks like Grandmaster Jakob Luge
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000]   spoke to his experience training Hans Nieman
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.240]   and has said that his memory and intuition
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.040]   were quite brilliant.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.480]   So as you see, there's a lot of perspectives on this.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.680]   Chess Base has a good summary of the saga
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.140]   that I'll link in the description.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.020]   Also note that this is so quickly moving
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.620]   that new stuff might come out between me recording this
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.320]   and publishing the episode.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.720]   But I thought I'd mention this anyway
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.400]   since the episode with the Botas sisters
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.440]   is a conversation about chess
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.240]   and was recorded shortly before the controversy.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.720]   So we didn't talk about it.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.960]   I'm considering having Hans on this podcast
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.360]   and also Magnus back on the podcast,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.520]   and maybe others like Hikaru
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.920]   or folks from chess.com's anti-cheat staff
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.500]   to discuss their really interesting
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.700]   cheating detection algorithms.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.840]   But I may also just stay out of it.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.120]   I find chess to be a beautiful game
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460]   and the chess community
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.080]   full of fascinating, brilliant people.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.880]   And so I'll keep having conversations
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520]   like these about chess.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.820]   It's fun.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.920]   My goal with this podcast and in general as a human being
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.000]   is to increase the amount of love in the world.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.040]   Sometimes that involves celebrating brilliance and beauty
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.300]   in science, in art, in chess.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.640]   Sometimes it involves empathetic conversations
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.120]   with controversial figures that seek to understand,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.880]   not deride.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.880]   Sometimes it involves standing against the internet lynch mob
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.120]   as the chess base article calls it,
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.920]   to hear the story of a human being who is under attack,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.000]   even if it means I get attacked in the process as well.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.920]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.840]   To support it,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.560]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.760]   And now, dear friends,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.980]   here's Alexandra and Andrea Botas.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.900]   You just got back from Italy.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.620]   What's the most memorable thing?
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.060]   I was just there recently as well.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.940]   - It was very chaotic because we went out on a whim
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.900]   and we only had our first hotel book.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   And then we rented a car and drove around all of the cities
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.540]   and went to like five different cities
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.660]   in about a week and a bit.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.300]   So I think it was just the variety
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.780]   of seeing so many different places
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.660]   when we're used to being at home all the time.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.340]   And Andrea, is yours your luggage?
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.060]   - Yeah, I would say it was the most stressful vacation
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.580]   we've been in in our life.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.620]   And it was a valuable learning lesson
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.780]   because now I know how to be prepared for trips.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.620]   But we lost our bags and I never got them back.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.700]   And like Alex said,
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.620]   we didn't know where we'd be sleeping every night
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.980]   and we're just driving through a new city
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.660]   with a giant van in the most narrowest streets
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.420]   and getting in many, many fights with Italian men.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.900]   So it wasn't really a vacation.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.100]   - I saw this motion so many times.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.540]   Wasn't it liberating to lose your baggage?
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.700]   Is it like silver lining?
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.980]   - It was liberating.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.780]   My entire life, I've always had the issue of overpacking.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.300]   - And I told her before the trip,
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.100]   "Andrea, you're gonna pack light, right?"
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.940]   "Yeah, Alex, yeah."
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.140]   And then I see her stuffing her overweight suitcase.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.300]   - But you did the same.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.420]   We both had giant, big extra baggage that we didn't need.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.500]   And I'm actually very glad we lost it
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   because for Venice, hauling that around on all the boats
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.100]   and through the tiny streets and there's no Ubers.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.460]   And now it's the first time where I can travel
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.460]   without checking in a bag, which I've never done before.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.020]   So now I've learned what it means to pack light
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.900]   'cause I saw that I could survive off of just my,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.980]   this sounds very dramatic,
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.380]   but it was really a big learning lesson for me.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.740]   - The driving must've been crazy
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.900]   'cause driving in Italy is rough.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.580]   - The driving was crazy.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.820]   I did most of it and it would be really interesting
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.220]   driving through places like Florence
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.140]   or even through the beach areas that were super windy
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.540]   because they're two-way streets
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.300]   that should really only be one way.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.180]   So you'd be driving this huge van
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.460]   and then another car comes on a cliff
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.500]   and you're just waiting for it to slowly pass.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.020]   So it took all of my focus and concentration
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.420]   to drive well in Italy,
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.020]   but it was actually really relaxing
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.060]   because the hardest thing about making a lot of videos
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.180]   online is you're always thinking about it,
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.460]   what's coming next.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.060]   And when we were in Italy, it was so chaotic
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.300]   that I did not think about work for a good week and a bit.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.460]   - Oh, 'cause you're just-
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.300]   - We were stressed.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.780]   - I was just trying to keep us alive.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.580]   - It just seemed higher priority.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.660]   - And that was kind of fun.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.860]   - It was kind of fun.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.260]   - No planning, nothing.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.460]   - I wouldn't recommend it or ever do that again, but.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.420]   - It sounds pretty awesome.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.100]   - And we even randomly ran into two friends of ours
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.260]   who were in the same city
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.100]   and we just traveled with them for about half of the trip.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.260]   - Yeah, so you just took on the chaos.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.900]   - Exactly, it was an adventure.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.780]   - Okay, and I see like,
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.980]   'cause you were using your hands a lot,
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.780]   you picked up some of the Italian hand gestures.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.100]   - I did, we did get yelled at by a lot of Italians.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.380]   The old Italian grandmas would come to us after breakfast
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.900]   'cause we'd leave something on the plate
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.740]   and she'd be like,
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.740]   "You could feed an entire village with that.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.660]   Tell your friends."
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.300]   And we'd feel so ashamed.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.820]   - Yeah, we got cursed out a lot,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.580]   but it really reminded me of where we grew up.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.500]   - That's true.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.340]   - Yeah, bring back those memorisms.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.340]   - Where'd you grow up?
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.700]   - We're Romanian,
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.380]   but it was like an immigrant neighborhood.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.380]   - In Canada.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.300]   - So, you know, same, if you don't finish your plate,
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.020]   that's disrespectful to the people who made the food.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.620]   - How was the food in Italy?
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.060]   I feel like the carbs thing is too intense.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.300]   - Yeah, I think very overrated in my opinion.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.100]   - So I'm actually not supposed to eat gluten
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.700]   'cause I have an allergy,
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.300]   but I was in Italy and it's gluten galore.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.820]   So I was actually eating a lot of it
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.860]   and it was very interesting
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.860]   'cause I didn't get sick while I was in Italy,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.060]   but I do while I'm in the US.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.060]   So somehow the food was actually maybe more okay
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.740]   for me to digest, which I appreciated,
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.660]   but I didn't like it as much as I thought.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.780]   Did you like the food there?
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.940]   - Yeah, no, I did, I did.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.580]   I love carbs, but it feels like Vegas.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.940]   When I go there for the food,
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.820]   it's like if I stay here too long,
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.380]   I'm gonna do things I regret.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.180]   That's what it feels like with the food.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.140]   'Cause I don't know how to moderate
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.900]   and everybody is pushing very large portions
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.020]   and while kind of eating things on you.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.700]   Pasta, pizza, and bread, so delicious.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.540]   So yeah, I love it, but I regret everything.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.860]   So it's like, I don't wanna go to a place
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.540]   where I'm going to regret everything I do
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.460]   for too long of a time.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.260]   - Yeah, surprisingly the people there though
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.100]   are still very fit and everyone stays in good shape,
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.940]   but that's probably 'cause you're walking around all day
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.380]   and you're much more active than in the US.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.540]   - And they also just know how to moderate food.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.300]   I think I've gotten used to the US way of eating.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.060]   - The US portions. - What is that?
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.060]   - Just a lot, always a lot and more.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.580]   - And I feel in the US, food advertisements
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.340]   are also much more in your face
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.540]   and you're more often reminded of junk food
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.900]   than we were in Italy.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.540]   So even though we were eating less healthy things,
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.340]   I think we were getting cravings
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.660]   and being pushed towards junk food less often.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.180]   - All right, I gotta ask you a hard question.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.940]   So the romance languages,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.700]   so I think French is up there as like number one.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.420]   - Number one in terms of?
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.260]   - I don't know.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.620]   - Who's ranking them?
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.900]   (both laughing)
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.380]   - Oh, you guys speak Italian or no?
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.660]   - Not Italian, but we studied French and Spanish in school.
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.500]   - We speak Romanian, which is--
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.340]   - And Romanian.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.380]   - I feel like every country calls their language
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.220]   a romance language.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.620]   - No, but it's Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.020]   And I think there was one more that was like this dialect,
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.460]   but those are considered the romance languages.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.500]   - Okay, so where would you put Italian?
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.340]   - I think we got yelled at so much in Italian
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.220]   that it's not gonna be a lover.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.660]   - Okay, so it wasn't working.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.020]   - It's on the bottom of the list
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.060]   'cause people did not use it nicely to us.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.260]   - But I always really liked how French sounds.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.060]   I think something about it where maybe Spanish
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.980]   actually sounds nicer to the ears,
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.020]   but French has more character and it feels more sultry.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.060]   So I like French.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.900]   What about you?
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.140]   - I think it's nicer too.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.460]   - Sultry, okay.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.020]   - Yeah.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.020]   - I feel like French, in France,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.300]   I feel like I'm always being judged.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.700]   Like they're better than me.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.540]   That's what French--
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.380]   - They are better than us.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.380]   - That's so true.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.220]   (laughing)
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.740]   That's just so true.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.380]   Which is why, yeah, I long to belong to that.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.900]   I like the British accent.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.100]   - The British accent? - Really?
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.940]   - Yeah.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.900]   - Actually, one thing we did on our Italian trip
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.380]   is we just picked up British accents
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.540]   for the entire trip for fun.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.540]   And we forgot we were doing them to the point
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.860]   where we talked to British people
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.980]   and they'd ask us, "Why are you talking like that?"
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.740]   We just couldn't stop.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.540]   - I did feel much more elegant and mature.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.380]   - That's true.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.140]   - People, I don't know if they felt the same way about us,
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.620]   but it was more of the confidence.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.460]   - You do feel like you're more poised, for sure.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.300]   - Yeah.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.340]   - So how'd you guys get into chess?
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.580]   When did you first, let's say,
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.740]   when did you first fall in love with chess?
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.060]   - So we both started playing when we were pretty young,
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.180]   around six years old.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.860]   That's when our dad taught us.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.260]   And I enjoyed playing chess
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.780]   because I had good results early on,
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.060]   but a lot of it was being pushed from my dad to play chess.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.380]   And I only really started loving it
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.340]   when we moved from Canada and we started moving a lot.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.540]   And chess was the one stable thing that I had.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.860]   And it was also where all of my friends were.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.540]   So it was kind of that foundational thing for me.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.660]   And that's when I started studying chess very intensely.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.220]   And when I started putting in the hours out of my own will,
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.060]   and not because I was being pushed by my dad,
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.700]   that's when I started really loving it.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.620]   And I even wanted to take time off college
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.420]   to just focus on chess.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.460]   - So training and competing?
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.940]   - Training and competing, yeah.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.140]   It was when I was doing it for myself
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.460]   that I started getting my best results.
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.540]   - And actually enjoying the thing.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.180]   - And really enjoying it, yeah.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.940]   I would spend summer vacation studying for tournaments,
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.500]   and my mom would come and say,
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.780]   "You need to make friends, go leave the house."
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.900]   And I'd be like, "No, I need to play chess."
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.820]   And I remember those moments.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.380]   - That you rebelled by playing chess.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.380]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.620]   - How did you get into it?
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.700]   - Yeah, my experience with loving in high school
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.500]   is very opposite from Alex's.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.180]   But right, my sister was playing
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.020]   and my dad taught me when I was also six.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.420]   - Andrea was cool in high school, unlike me.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.260]   - You were.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.900]   - I wouldn't say cool, I'd say more balanced
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.860]   and I was interested in other hobbies.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.780]   In my childhood, if I ever really did love chess,
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.940]   there's certainly moments about traveling
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.380]   and being together with my family
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.700]   and spending those moments together,
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.780]   but those are more the social and the experiences.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.500]   But funny enough, I think my happiest moment
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.060]   where I really played the game for my own enjoyment
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.540]   was probably my most recent tournament,
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.060]   because this was after, obviously, we've been streaming
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.100]   and I'm no longer in high school,
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.100]   but when I was in school, I was always playing for college
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.260]   and for the results, trying to build a resume.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.060]   So I was too stressed out about the pressure
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.420]   to really enjoy the game.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.420]   Whereas when I just played my first tournament,
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.740]   so it was after a two-year break because of the pandemic
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.500]   and it was also all live on Twitch,
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.980]   so there was some pressure, but it was the first time
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.900]   that I was really eager to study for the game,
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.140]   sitting and focusing since we've been streaming
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.380]   and not getting distracted by something else in years,
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.220]   like I said.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.540]   And the tournament experience, I hit my highest rating
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.340]   and it was my best tournament ever.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.420]   And I think most of that is
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.020]   'cause it came from my own enjoyment.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.500]   - So you didn't enjoy the domination,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.700]   'cause I think you did really well, right?
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.180]   This was a couple months ago?
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.380]   - Oh yeah, yeah, the tournament.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.460]   Well, of course, I think the results came
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.940]   from enjoying the tournament,
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.380]   'cause I would be in high school studying
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.820]   double, triple the amount of time, six hours every day
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.060]   compared to this tournament, I didn't even prepare for it.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.100]   And for three years, I wouldn't be able to pass one rating,
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.220]   whereas in this one tournament,
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.700]   I passed it by 70 points without even any preparation.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.460]   So it was, I think, as soon as you stop worrying
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.900]   about the competitions, when the games get much better.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.540]   - What does it mean to pass a rating?
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.340]   - So I was stuck at 1,900.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.140]   - 1,900 is 100 points off of expert.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:31.980]   - Yeah.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.780]   - Usually when you reach 2,000, you're considered an expert,
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.740]   which is the rating Andrea was going for.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.260]   - Okay, expert, that's a technical term,
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.860]   or that's like a talking trash term?
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.500]   - It's more of a colloquial term,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.300]   where if somebody's around a 2,000
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.580]   and you're playing them in a tournament,
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.700]   they won't have the actual title next to their name,
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.500]   but you say, "I'm playing an expert."
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.780]   - What about the more official things like master?
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.900]   Does that have to do with the rating or something else?
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.900]   - Yeah, so national master in the US is when you're 2,200.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.820]   - Okay, and what's international master?
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.660]   - International master is based off of a different system,
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.980]   the FIDE system, which is international.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.460]   To be an international master, it's 2,400,
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.540]   and you have to have three international master norms.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.540]   - Yeah, I think Magnus said he's a 2,800-something.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.380]   - That was, yeah.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.660]   - And then he said, "That's pretty decent."
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.500]   - Well, he always talks about it like that.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500]   - But see, the thing is, I think what he meant
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.780]   is that's a decent rating
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.140]   because it accurately captures his actual level.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.020]   So it's not overinflated or underinflated and so on.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.860]   And so the discussion there was,
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.460]   how do you get to, can a human being get to 2,900?
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.340]   And then he says, "Because my current rating
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.540]   "is pretty decent, representing my skill level,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.340]   "it's gonna be a long road to actually get there."
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.460]   - 'Cause it's like, so you have to beat people
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.540]   your same level, that's how the number increases.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.300]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.540]   - And you beat a bunch of people in the tournament, right?
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.380]   That are higher than your level.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.620]   - I did, I got very lucky.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.140]   Oh, I was playing, I was really nervous
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.700]   'cause my category was like 200 points above my rating.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.100]   And of course, I was very rusty
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.580]   and I hadn't played a tournament in a while,
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.740]   but it went pretty well.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.620]   - Do you feel the pressure
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.620]   when you're actually recording it, like the streaming?
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.900]   - It was definitely, so before every round,
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.300]   I was vlogging and I was doing meet and greets
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.020]   and doing other things for the live stream.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.100]   - Yeah, I saw you do a meet and greet.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.380]   You didn't know what the hell you were doing, it's great.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.220]   - Yeah.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.260]   - Like, how do I do this?
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.500]   - Yeah, I see.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.580]   - What do I do?
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.180]   - It was actually really wholesome.
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.900]   The beginning was very silly
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.620]   'cause I was just not expecting
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.300]   that it was gonna be more of a seminar.
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.580]   I thought it was like, oh, you pose and take pictures.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.500]   But they actually asked really nice, meaningful questions,
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.580]   but unfortunately, it's bad for YouTube retention
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.580]   and we cut 'em all out, so.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.980]   - Bad for YouTube.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.700]   The good long-form conversation.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.380]   So it was like questions, Q&A type of thing.
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.220]   - Exactly.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.420]   You have to have very fast-paced for YouTube
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.140]   and that seminar was not fast-paced.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.820]   - Okay, well, not everything in life
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.100]   needs to be on YouTube, right?
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:57.940]   - That's true.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.940]   - There's like two parallel things,
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.420]   stuff that's fun for YouTube.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.380]   - Yes, one day we'll post that Q&A on.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.380]   - Yeah, when you guys, like,
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.420]   when you become like ultra famous,
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.180]   you're currently just regular famous.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.620]   - And then they'll appreciate the long, slow content, yes.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.420]   - And that, the YouTube aspect, the creation aspect,
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.580]   does that add to the fun, ultimately, of the chess,
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.140]   of like your love of chess?
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.620]   - Oh, for the love of chess in general
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.340]   or just for competing in that one tournament?
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.380]   - No, love of chess in general.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.020]   I think you said that for competing for that tournament
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:28.980]   was adding pressure.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.620]   - Yeah, but actually I would say like a good pressure,
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.980]   but yeah, this is where I differed to Alex
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.860]   because when I was just competitive and I was younger,
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.340]   I don't think I loved chess as much
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.060]   as when I started doing it for content
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.540]   because unlike her, who a lot of her friends
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.300]   and social circle were other chess players,
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.380]   I never really traveled
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.060]   and built really solid friendships through chess
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.860]   until I started streaming and meeting other chess streamers
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.940]   and actually playing and talking to people for fun
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.220]   rather than just always being alone in the game
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.540]   and never really meeting other people my age
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.140]   or people with similar interests.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.220]   So I would say Twitch was the thing
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.300]   that really changed how I approached the game.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.220]   - I think with some YouTubers,
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.420]   there's a pressure to be almost somebody else.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.340]   You create a persona and you're stuck in that persona.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:19.100]   I think I'm too much of a boomer
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.620]   to know what the hell Twitch is anyway,
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.820]   but it feels like when you're actually live streaming,
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.180]   you can't help but be who you really are.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.860]   - I think it's, oh, well, I think when you're live streaming
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.340]   and I've talked to a lot of other streamers about this,
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.820]   you kind of just over-exaggerate one side
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.780]   of your personality and of course,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.700]   it's kind of like being like on all the time.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.300]   Like you're trying to be more entertaining
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.260]   and sometimes you're being sillier at moments
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.860]   or more, you take what character traits
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.860]   people know you for.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.740]   And for me, one is being like ADHD
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.220]   and the younger sibling who's very energetic
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.900]   and causes trouble, even though sometimes it goes quick.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.300]   - Yeah, I'm sure you cause trouble just for the camera.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.740]   - Yeah, right? (laughs)
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.580]   - Yeah, I think, and of course,
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.660]   once you're live streaming for like four or five hours,
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.020]   there's gonna be moments in the stream where it's more chill
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.140]   but especially when you're editing that content
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.820]   or you're doing bigger streams that are shorter,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.180]   you are kind of playing up a side of yourself.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.180]   Because of course, there's a lot of parts of me
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.420]   that I don't show to the camera
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.180]   'cause they're not as entertaining to watch.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.740]   Like the more serious part.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.460]   - And also there's things that you are really interested in
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.500]   about what you do.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.100]   Like I love competitive chess where I could sit
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.100]   and really think about it,
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.540]   but I know that that is not gonna be
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.780]   as entertaining for a stream.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.220]   I know that's not gonna be as entertaining for YouTube.
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.500]   So you kind of have to take what you like,
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.460]   but then really adapt it for whatever the format is.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.820]   And sometimes that feels inauthentic,
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.500]   but other times it just feels like repackaging
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.060]   what you love for people in a more general audience to enjoy.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.940]   - Do you feel like it's a trap a little bit as you evolve?
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.340]   - Oh, I think social media is, oh, sorry, go ahead.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.620]   - Social media in general is a trap of that kind?
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.380]   - Well, so we've been trying to switch
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.780]   to learn how to make YouTube videos recently.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.380]   And so much of learning YouTube school
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.580]   is kind of the beastification of content
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.540]   where you try to get to the point of the video
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.420]   within like the first 10 seconds to not lose people.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.180]   - You mean like Mr. Beast?
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.340]   - Yeah, where it's so fast paced,
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.700]   there's a reason to wait, there's high stakes.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.420]   And everything is created to keep people watching the video
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.060]   and keep people on the platform.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.340]   And in some ways it is a trap
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.380]   because it's harder to do the kind of content you like
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.180]   because you really have to squeeze it to be like,
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.460]   okay, well, do we have a good thumbnail for this?
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.620]   Do we have a good title for this?
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.060]   And that's something that we're trying to figure out
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.820]   how to keep true to what we wanna do.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.460]   - Yeah, see, the way I think about it is,
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.380]   yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can create
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.620]   and yeah, the Mr. Beastification process.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.180]   But also I think about what are the videos,
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.140]   conversations or things I will create in this life
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.020]   that will be the best thing I do.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.740]   And I try not to do things in my life
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.820]   that will prevent me from getting there.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.940]   I feel like if you're always focusing on doing kind of,
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.620]   optimizing the thumbnail and the 10 seconds and so on,
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.420]   you'll never do the thing that's truly you're known for
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.740]   and remembered for.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.100]   So finding that balance is tricky.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.260]   - I get that, but at the same time,
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.640]   this might be my own copium,
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.440]   which I know is a word you know now.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.600]   - Yeah, I'm slowly learning the full complexity
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.080]   of the term, yes.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.680]   - But the other way I think about it is,
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.600]   it is a skill to learn how to communicate
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   with large audiences.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.240]   And first I started streaming chess,
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.480]   which is something I just did and really loved.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.440]   But now I have to learn how to translate that format.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.240]   And if that's a skillset we could build,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.080]   then we could use it to do really important things.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.720]   And I've seen a lot of YouTubers
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.120]   who have done interviews about how,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.640]   they didn't love the kind of content they did at first,
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.040]   but what they're doing right now is really meaningful.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.720]   So I like to think of it maybe like skill development,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.280]   'cause not everybody hits off podcasts
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.960]   where they can talk to super interesting people
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.140]   right off the bat.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.240]   - Yeah, you can be slow and boring in a podcast.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.280]   You don't have to worry about the first 10 seconds.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.200]   I mean, people like keep pushing me for,
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.480]   'cause the first 10 seconds of the videos I do is,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.080]   well, I know it's most important for YouTube,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.760]   but I don't give a damn.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.160]   I wrote a Chrome extension
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.080]   that hides all the views and likes.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.800]   I don't look at the click through.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.040]   - I don't look at Twitch views, Andrea does.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.120]   So we also can relate.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.400]   - I love numbers too, but that's why I don't look at it.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.680]   'Cause you become like,
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   oh, you'll start to think that a conversation
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.760]   or I think you did sucks because it doesn't get views.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   But that's just not the case.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   The YouTube algorithm is this monster
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.160]   that figures stuff out.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.480]   And if you let it control your mind,
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.680]   I feel like it's gonna destroy you creatively.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.120]   So you have to find a nice balance.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.000]   - I have to say, I was laughing a little bit
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.920]   when I was listening to the Magnus episode.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.840]   In the first 10 minutes,
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.240]   you guys are talking about soccer, football.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.120]   - Two robots seem human in the conversation.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.560]   - I was like, let's have some fun,
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.760]   make conversation about non-chess related topics.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.200]   - Yeah, talk about sports.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   - Yeah, it was kind of hilarious.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.880]   I was surprised that even at his level,
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.680]   I wasn't sure, but I was surprised how much he loves chess.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.920]   It sounds cliche to say,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.520]   but the way he looked at a chess board,
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.360]   you know those memes,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.520]   like I wish somebody looked at me the way,
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.320]   he's still like the way he glanced down
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.160]   and he reached for the pieces of excitement
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   to show me something.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.960]   There wasn't like, okay, I'll show you.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.240]   It was like, there was still that fire.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.840]   - That's something that always shocks me
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.440]   about some of like super grandmasters.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.120]   Like one of my coaches was a person who also,
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.480]   his name's GM Hammer of Norway.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.280]   He also coached Magnus, he was his second.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.080]   And he was helping me train for my tournament.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.480]   And I was kind of putting off doing the homework.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.560]   He's like, if you're putting it off,
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.960]   that means you're studying the wrong thing.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.480]   Like you should be enjoying, even when you're practicing,
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.320]   which when I grew up, I thought to get to the top level,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.080]   like practicing has to be hard and unpleasant.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.040]   And when I was listening to your Magnus episode,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.920]   he was like, I didn't read books very much.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.000]   Or it was one thing that you said
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.240]   that's like very normal for studying classical chess
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.400]   that he didn't do just 'cause it didn't interest him.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.200]   - He says I suck at puzzles.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.160]   I don't like puzzles.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.280]   - Yeah, and he doesn't do what he doesn't enjoy.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.640]   And that's because it's like purely driven out of passion.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.360]   - I think the internet was like, I suck at puzzles too.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.200]   - Yeah, they like them.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.600]   - Yeah, grandmas. - They're related.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.040]   - I don't have to study at all.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.240]   It's just, it's fun.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.880]   But I think the lesson there that's really powerful
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.960]   is he spends most of the day thinking about chess
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.440]   because he wants to.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.200]   So do whatever, if you're into getting better at chess,
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.120]   do whatever it takes. - Exactly.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.720]   - To actually just the number of hours
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.400]   you spend a day thinking about chess, maximize that.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.080]   If you're like super serious about it.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.800]   - I actually get very addicted
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.720]   whenever I start studying chess,
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.120]   which is why I don't do it as seriously
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.600]   when I'm focused on content.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.160]   'Cause I go through these rabbit holes
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.880]   where if I'm focusing on chess,
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.560]   I wanna be as good as I possibly can at the game.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.320]   Otherwise it's hard for me to enjoy it
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.280]   'cause it's such a competitive thing.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.240]   And I remember training for tournaments.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.120]   And when you're training for tournaments,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.480]   you even start dreaming about chess
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.320]   and you can't stop thinking about it.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.200]   And it's as if you're flipped
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.360]   into this completely different world,
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.240]   which is also what I like best about the game,
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.360]   that it's a completely different living experience.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.360]   - And then you take some drugs
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.520]   and now you start to see things on the ceiling.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.400]   Is there some factual hallucination
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.680]   to the Queen's Gambit, like those scenes?
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.840]   - I think it's--
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.120]   - Is that based on your life story?
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.520]   - From, well, I can't say that on camera.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.000]   No, just kidding.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.400]   Actually, chess players are very careful to not take drugs.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.520]   They drink a lot.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.480]   They drink so much.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.320]   It's actually crazy for how good
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.440]   they're able to play chess when they do.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.800]   But when it comes to things like psychedelics
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.240]   or other things, they usually stay away from those
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.200]   'cause they don't wanna mess anything up in their brain.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.920]   - So this is actually an intervention.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.080]   I saw that you mentioned somewhere,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.360]   I think it was the lie detector test
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.080]   where you have a drinking problem.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.320]   Is that an actual--
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.400]   - I think that's actually a meme
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.280]   that we like to joke about on stream
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.000]   because occasionally we'd have a white claw on stream
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.240]   or something like that and then people meme about it.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.680]   It goes back to Andrea's point of amplifying
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.520]   a part of your personality to make yourself
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.520]   a little bit more entertaining.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.000]   - I'm gonna use that as an excuse from now on.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.400]   This podcast is just amplifying a part of the personality.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.640]   I'm not really like this.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.800]   But have you played drunk?
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.640]   Like Magnus has played drunk.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.520]   He says it helps him with the creativity.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.880]   Is there any truth to that?
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.600]   - Well, Andrea is under 21, so she's obviously--
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.080]   - Would never do this. - Would never do that.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.200]   But I have played while drinking.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.520]   Actually, I enjoy playing chess and drinking
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.840]   more than pre-gaming or going out to a club and drinking,
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.200]   which sounds really silly.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.800]   And I'll usually play against opponents
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.000]   who are also having some beer.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.120]   And it does make you feel like you're seeing the game
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.600]   from a fresher perspective where it can sometimes
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.280]   make you feel more confident, liquid confidence.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.800]   And it does help with creativity.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.440]   You just feel like you could pull things off.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.400]   But there's also a limit.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   It's more like you've had one drink or two drink,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.800]   but then it goes beyond that.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.520]   And then you just start missing tactics
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520]   and it's not worth it.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.360]   - Yeah, I think it only helps players
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.000]   in very short time controls.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.600]   One time I was challenging this grandmaster on stream
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.240]   and we were playing bullet chess,
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.960]   which is one minute chess.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   And I was giving him handicaps and I said,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.520]   "Okay, you have to take four shots before the next game."
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.640]   And he just got like 10 times stronger
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.360]   and transformed into like the Hulk
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.680]   and destroyed me more than last game.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.760]   So, but of course, if you're playing like a three hour game,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.600]   it's gonna get old.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.880]   But I think in short time controls, it's amazing.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.480]   - Yeah, definitely has to be blitz.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.440]   It has to be where it's more intuition
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.280]   rather than sitting and calculating.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.040]   - This is probably like negatively affecting
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.080]   your ability to calculate.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.360]   - Absolutely.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.640]   - How much, when you guys play,
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.680]   when you look at the chess board,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.000]   how much of it is calculation?
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.440]   How much of it is intuition?
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   How much of it is memorized openings?
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.600]   - It really depends between short form chess.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.640]   So five minutes, three minutes, one minute
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.960]   and classical chess.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   - What's your favorite to play?
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.360]   - I love playing blitz now because that's most of what I do.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.320]   And that's actually how I got into chess streaming
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.160]   'cause I couldn't spend entire weekends
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.320]   or weeks playing tournaments.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.400]   So I would just, while I was in college,
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.640]   log on and play these long blitz or bullet sessions.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.960]   And it's very fast.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.400]   So you don't have time to go calculate as deeply.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.640]   You basically have to calculate short lines pretty quickly.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.240]   And a lot of it is pattern recognition and intuition.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.280]   - That's three minutes you said?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.520]   - Three minutes, yeah.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.360]   - Okay, cool.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.920]   And so for that, it's just basically intuition.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.760]   - A lot of it is intuition, yeah.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.800]   - See, I saw on the streams,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.720]   you actually keep talking while playing chess.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.560]   It seems really difficult.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.400]   - Yeah, that helps my result.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.600]   That doesn't help my results.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.440]   - It doesn't?
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.480]   - It helps the content, not the game.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.880]   - But you can still do it.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.080]   'Cause it feels like,
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.000]   how can you possibly concentrate while talking?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.160]   - It's because so much of it is intuition.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.720]   You're not, while you're talking,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.080]   you're thinking about that topic,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.320]   but then you just come to the board
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.160]   and you just understand what you should be doing here.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.800]   And then sometimes you get in trouble 'cause you're talking
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.480]   and you have now lost half of your time.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.320]   You have a minute and a half,
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.480]   your opponent has three,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.320]   and you're kind of at a disadvantage.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.880]   But that kind of goes to show
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.720]   that that's how blitz chess usually works,
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.240]   whereas classical is very different.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.880]   - Which of you is better at chess?
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.280]   I mean, let's do it this way.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.480]   Can you, Andrea, can you say,
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.920]   in which way is Alex stronger than you?
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.760]   Which way is she weaker than you?
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.840]   Not physically in terms of chess.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.320]   - Well, yes, of course she is higher rated.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.400]   But when we do play,
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.840]   I think her strengths against me,
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.720]   where she really gets me, is the end game.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.840]   She has stronger end game.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.360]   So she can, and I actually have a stronger opening.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.200]   But as soon as she's able to simplify-
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.480]   - I'm supposed to say what is good about you,
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.320]   not you.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.720]   - Yeah, no, I'm getting there.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.960]   Well, see, this is what I'm saying,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.440]   because don't worry, it's related, okay?
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.280]   'Cause I can get an advantage in the beginning of the game,
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.240]   but as soon as she starts trading pieces down,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.520]   like my confidence drops,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.240]   because I know that the end game
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.600]   is the hardest part of the game and the longest,
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.320]   and that's where she ends up beating me.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.600]   So her end game is her,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.920]   I think really what makes the difference.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.760]   And she has to be a little bit-
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.640]   - It sounds like her psychological warfare is better too.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.480]   - That definitely.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.560]   - 'Cause if you're getting nervous.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.400]   - That is definitely.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   - But it's harder to play against higher rated players,
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.920]   same how Magnus in former World Championship champions
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.560]   have that psychological edge.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.600]   So I think it's always gonna be different for Andrea,
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.400]   'cause she knows statistically,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.960]   she should be winning something like one in four games,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.160]   but she usually does better than that,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.040]   'cause she's very distracting and talks a lot.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.120]   - That does help.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.960]   - What does it feel like to play a higher rated player?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.720]   What's the experience of that?
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.840]   Playing somebody like Magnus.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.920]   - So it depends on how much higher rated than you they are.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.840]   If it's someone who's like between me and Andrea,
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.280]   let's say it's a 200 point difference,
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.320]   you know they should win,
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.760]   but at least you still feel like you have a chance.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.900]   I was playing in Title Tuesday,
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.560]   which is this tournament chess.com has every Tuesday.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.840]   And I got really lucky, beat a GM,
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.960]   drew an international master,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.560]   and then I got paired against Hikaru Nakamura.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.520]   And my brain just went blank,
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.280]   'cause I just know that I'm so unlikely to win
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.600]   that I couldn't even play the game properly
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.080]   when it's that much of a difference
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.520]   where they should be winning like 99% of the time.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.860]   - But that's like psychological.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.600]   So you're saying that's the biggest experience
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.280]   is like actually knowing the numbers
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.640]   and statistically thinking there's no way I can win.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.760]   But I meant like, is there a suffocating feeling
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.900]   like positionally you feel like
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.880]   you're constantly under attack?
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.680]   - You just feel like you're slowly getting outsmarted.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.660]   And the worst is when you don't even know
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.840]   what you're doing wrong.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.600]   You come out of that and you're like,
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.480]   I thought I was doing great and I got slowly squeezed.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.400]   I didn't understand what was going on.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.740]   And you're just kind of baffled.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.280]   It's kind of like watching AlphaZero beat up Stockfish.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.720]   And you don't really understand
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.320]   why it's making certain moves
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.760]   or how it thought of the plan.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.600]   You just see it slowly getting the position better.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.280]   And that's what it feels like.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.960]   - I would add, it's kind of different for me
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.240]   if they're someone who's significantly higher rated.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.000]   So let's say more than like 300 points
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.720]   or you're playing Magnus.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.540]   What I notice is I just feel lost straight.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.560]   As soon as I don't know my preparation
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.360]   because they know so many opening lines
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.280]   that they're gonna know the best line to beat you
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.760]   that you haven't studied.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.120]   So then on move 10, you're like,
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.360]   he already has a maybe plus 0.5 advantage
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.620]   which is really small.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.720]   But for someone with such a significant skill level,
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.240]   you know you're already lost at that point.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.920]   And it's like a third of the game.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.760]   - What are the strengths and weaknesses of Andrea?
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.480]   - Andrea is very good at opening preparation.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.320]   - As she said.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.760]   - As she said, she likes bringing that up.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.360]   I mean, she's very meticulous about it
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.680]   where she'll really go in and learn her lines.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.020]   And having that initial starting confidence
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.640]   isn't just helpful for the opening
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.320]   but it helps develop your plans for the middle game.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.180]   So I think she's very good at that.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:27.880]   I think she's actually pretty good at tactical combinations.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.800]   - What is tactics?
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.560]   - Tactics is like solving puzzles
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.520]   or basically finding lines that are forced
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.120]   where if you find them, you're going to win.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.720]   - So that's like puzzles within a position.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.800]   Whereas strategic chess is making slow moves
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.240]   and over the process of like 20 moves,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.920]   you get a slightly better position
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.020]   based on an understanding of the overall strategy.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.020]   - So in my extensive research of you on Wikipedia,
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.560]   it says your most played opening
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.900]   is the King's Indian Defense
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.800]   in which "Black allows white to advance their pawns
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.340]   "to the center of the board in the first two moves."
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.200]   Is there any truth to this?
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.440]   - So the King's Indian-- - And what is it?
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.620]   - Probably is my most played opening.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.080]   And it's one where even when my coach
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.320]   who was a grandmaster taught me,
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.240]   he's like, "So you know,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.160]   "I've been playing the King's Indian for 10 years
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.200]   "and I still don't understand it."
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.580]   And it's one of those openings
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.600]   that computers really don't like
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   because you do-- - They hate it.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.320]   - Or at least Stockfish doesn't like it.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.940]   Maybe AlphaZero would change their mind.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.420]   I forgot to look at what--
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.880]   - Can you show me, by the way, what it is?
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.720]   - Yeah.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.880]   - Is it white's opening or black's opening?
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.880]   - Black responds to the d4 queen's pawn push
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.920]   and you take your knight out to f6.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.480]   I'll just put in the stereotypical,
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.180]   classical King's Indian more so to say.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.220]   - We actually have a very famous King's Indian game
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.580]   in the notes that we prepared for hours.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.180]   For the record, I asked you guys for some games
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.480]   that you find pretty cool
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.720]   and maybe to get a chance to talk about some.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.860]   - Yeah.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.420]   So this is the King's Indian.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:14.420]   As you can see, white has much more control over the center.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.720]   White has three pawns in the center
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.580]   while black has none past the fifth rank.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.940]   And you just have this pawn on d6.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.700]   And one of the ideas in chess is
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.160]   if you're not taking the center,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.140]   then your plan revolves around
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.640]   trying to continually challenge it.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.180]   But what is really fun about the King's Indian
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:38.080]   is that black sometimes gets these crazy king side attacks
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.820]   while white gets queen side attacks.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.300]   And even though it's a little bit suspicious for black
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.760]   and the computer could usually break it,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.260]   it's hard to defend as a human when you're being attacked.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.700]   But if you don't pull off the attack as black,
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.360]   then you're just gonna end up being lost in the end game.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.520]   - So it's like a very asymmetrical position.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.920]   - It's very asymmetrical.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.420]   Although a lot of people now stop playing
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.060]   into the classical King's Indian,
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.820]   even though computers give it a big advantage.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.960]   And they play these slower lines in the King's Indian,
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.700]   which are less fun to play.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.620]   - What's slower mean?
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.640]   It takes a longer time to like do something interesting with?
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.740]   - They basically don't let you get
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.660]   as much of a king side attack
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.000]   because they try opening up the center.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.780]   And then you have no weaknesses,
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.000]   but you're just slowly improving the position of your pieces
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.300]   instead of being able to go for that king side attack.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.580]   - So for people just listening,
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.820]   there is the white pawns are all on the fourth row
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.860]   in a row together.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.500]   That feels like a bad position.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.340]   - For black?
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.460]   - For white.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.380]   - Oh, you don't like taking the center?
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.460]   - No, I like taking the center.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.060]   Now you're talking trash already.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.900]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.460]   - But like, they just like, they're like, feel vulnerable.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.740]   They're in a row together.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.420]   Like it's like, you know,
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.940]   'cause they're like, who's gonna defend them?
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.560]   I guess the nice defend and the queen defends it.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.520]   - You're actually talking about a theme
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.400]   that you do see sometimes, which is called hanging pawns.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.540]   And when you have two pawns right next to each other
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.420]   with no other pawns to defend them.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.000]   So it is a valid point.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.800]   And actually as black, you're trying to break apart
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.520]   these pawns or get them to push
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.800]   and create some holes into the position,
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.680]   but it's a trade-off.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.920]   And that's a lot of what chess openings are about.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.200]   You get more space, but you'll also end up having
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.660]   to protect your pawns potentially or move them forward
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.220]   to the point where they're overextended.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.820]   - And plus the pawns being vulnerable, it's kind of fun.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.780]   This is like, there's more stuff in danger.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.500]   They're not, 'cause if it's like this,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.220]   everything's like trapped.
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.300]   Like you can't do anything.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.460]   - Everything's blocked, yeah.
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.060]   - Blocked off, yeah.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.940]   So you can't have fun.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.780]   - Yeah.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.140]   One of the most, one of the opening principles for white
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.540]   is get your pawns in the center.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.900]   So I'd say like, this is actually preferable for white.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.480]   - Let's go over some opening principles.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.320]   I have no clue about opening principles.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.000]   - 'Cause this is a very good learning lesson
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.020]   for any chess beginners in the audience.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:05.080]   Okay, so first thing you wanna do is control the center.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.200]   There you go, E4, the more aggressive one.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.760]   - Isn't that like the basic vanilla move?
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.920]   I didn't, somebody told me that's the most popular
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.360]   opening move in chess.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.200]   - It is.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.360]   - Why is that considered aggressive?
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.400]   - So it's E4 and D4, and the king's pawn is known
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.660]   as being for more tactical players,
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.860]   whereas D4 is known for more positional players.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.420]   So that's why it's considered more aggressive.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.420]   - Tactical. - More gambits with E4,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.260]   I think.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.580]   - So tactical means I'm gonna try to attack you.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.680]   - You're gonna try to go for puzzles
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:42.480]   and rely more on your combination abilities.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.540]   Whereas if it's something positional,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.820]   you usually have like three to four moves
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.020]   that are all good in the position,
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.740]   whereas tactics, you need to see this one line.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.260]   So it's more precise.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.540]   - So this one's cool 'cause he can like,
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.060]   you know, the queen can come out, the bishop can come out.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.500]   - Yeah, and that's one of the most popular checkmates,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.300]   and usually what you teach new students
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.740]   to try to cheese their friends,
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.940]   'cause then they feel really excited
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.340]   that they know this new trap where you bring the bishop
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.020]   and the queen out and you try to checkmate on F7.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.300]   - So the trap that queen's gambit,
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.260]   Beth Harmon falls for in their first game versus the janitor.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.700]   She gets all mad 'cause she gets checkmated very early.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.060]   - Oh, that's the one she gets checkmated with?
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.900]   - Yeah.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.100]   - Okay, I love how you guys were actually paying attention
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.940]   to the games carefully, which is pretty cool
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:29.260]   that they did a good job of evolving her game
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.740]   throughout the show to actually represent
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.420]   an actual growth of a chess player.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.580]   - Yeah, they really took every detail into consideration,
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.460]   which was cool.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.700]   - Okay, so what else?
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.540]   I brought stuff into the center.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.460]   - Oh, you wanna do the same?
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.620]   Okay, so then you wanna develop your pieces.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.740]   So in the beginning of the game,
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.180]   you wanna take out the bishops and knights first,
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.740]   because you don't wanna start with the most valuable piece,
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.900]   like the queen, 'cause then it'll become a vulnerability
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.140]   and it'll get attacked very early on.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.420]   And the reason you're taking out these two pieces first
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.500]   is 'cause you wanna castle your king.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.660]   So you can move a knight move or a bishop move,
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.700]   and that's considered developing.
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.300]   - Yeah, so at this stage,
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.940]   not like even before getting a few pawns out?
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   - You usually wanna start with getting a pawn
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.980]   because you wanna get space in the center,
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.900]   but also when you push pawns,
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.180]   it helps free up some of your pieces.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.860]   So usually start with one pawn first,
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.900]   and then you could start taking out your minor pieces,
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.220]   which is the bishop and the knight.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.380]   - I have anxiety about a pawn just floating out there,
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.700]   defenseless.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.460]   - But it's not attacked yet.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.100]   See, those are what you call ghost threats.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.500]   So you're scared of something that hasn't happened yet.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.180]   So if I were to attack it-
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.500]   - I feel like there's a deeper thing going on here.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.740]   Actually, let's say-
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.460]   - Yeah, so you're attacking the pawn in the center here,
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.580]   and it is vulnerable, but as soon as you do that,
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.740]   I can develop my own knight and defend it as well.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.380]   - Okay, and for people just listening,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.620]   there's two pawns that just came out to meet each other,
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.180]   and a couple of knights.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.060]   - We love the chess commentary.
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.020]   (laughing)
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.940]   - The pawns met after midnight.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.420]   Well, we gotta romanticize the game a bit.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.260]   - Exactly.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.100]   - Okay, cool.
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.860]   So if you bring out the bishops with the knights,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.580]   you're matching that with the other,
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.260]   the black is going to match it.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.740]   Whatever you're attacking with-
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.580]   - Yep, he's developing.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.420]   - Is gonna defend it.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.220]   - Now you can develop your bishop or your knight,
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.500]   whatever you'd like.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.300]   - Oh no, now you give him options.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.140]   - Oh, right, yeah.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:29.980]   There you go.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.460]   - Now I am attacking the pawn in the center,
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.580]   which is what you were afraid about before,
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.980]   but let's see how you defend it here.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.420]   (laughing)
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.660]   By doing this symmetrical thing,
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.660]   bringing out the knight on the other side.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.060]   - And actually your other move was good as well,
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.100]   defending with the pawn,
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.860]   because then you're freeing up space for your bishop.
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.500]   So you're basically trying to develop your pieces
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.460]   as quickly as possible, put your pawns in the center,
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.340]   and then get your king to safety.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.100]   And that's usually the basic opening tips that you get.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.060]   - And it is kind of counterintuitive
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.340]   that safety is in the corner of the board for a king.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.180]   - It's true.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.460]   - That was always confusing to me, but you know.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.780]   - Three pawns in front,
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.380]   though you typically don't push those.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.700]   Maybe like one, maybe I'll go one square,
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.060]   but these will be like the wall of defense,
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.060]   I keep them safe.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.060]   - But another way to also think about it
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   is your pieces usually wanna point towards the center.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.860]   If you have a knight closer to the center
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.420]   than closer to the side,
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.060]   it actually has more squares it can go to.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.220]   So a huge part of it is just wanting to have flexibility
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.620]   for where your pieces go.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.220]   So more pieces are going to be able
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.180]   to make threats in the center,
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.180]   or even open up the position.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.460]   So since that's where it's most likely to open,
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.420]   you want your king somewhere where the position
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.900]   will stay closed so that you have the pawns to defend.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.660]   - You know, there's like rules like this,
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.540]   but I always wonder, 'cause I build chess engines,
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.380]   but then you start to wonder like,
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.380]   why is it that positionally these things are good?
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.380]   Like you've built up an intuition about it,
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.340]   but I wish, and that's the thing that would be amazing
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.140]   if engines could explain,
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.300]   why is this kind of thing better than this kind of thing?
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.020]   You start to build up an intuition,
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.940]   but if I'm just like know nothing about chess,
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.260]   it feels confusing that cornering your king,
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.140]   like getting him like trapped here,
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.900]   like it feels like you could get checkmated easier there.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.920]   If I was just using like dumb intuition,
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.380]   but it seems like that's not the case.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.460]   - I imagine maybe, 'cause AlphaZero learned
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.580]   by playing games against itself, right?
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.820]   And I imagine if you have a lot of games,
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.340]   then you do build the intuition,
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.140]   because if you were to keep your king in the center,
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.400]   you just see that in those games,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.460]   you're dealing with threats a lot more often.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.300]   But yeah, there's shortcut rules,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.100]   and this doesn't even mean it's the best way to play chess,
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.700]   as we've seen with AlphaZero
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.020]   kind of changing the rules of the game a little bit.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.700]   But as a human, to learn it from scratch
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.280]   is a lot more difficult than to start with principles,
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.520]   so that's why beginners usually learn chess this way.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.940]   - Yeah, 'cause you're playing other humans,
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.940]   and the other humans have also operated
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.960]   on the different principles,
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.940]   and that's why people that come up now
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.640]   that are training with engines
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.360]   are just going to be much better
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.480]   than the people of the past,
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.860]   because they're gonna try out weirder ideas
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.940]   that go against the principles of old.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.980]   And they're gonna do like weird stuff,
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.780]   including sacrifices and stuff like that.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.020]   - Yeah, and I also think that's why AlphaZero
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:33.980]   was so shocking,
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.260]   because Stockfish was using an opening database,
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.660]   so it was already based off of knowledge
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.820]   that humans have from playing chess for years
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.800]   that we just thought is how you're supposed to play,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.260]   whereas AlphaZero just learned
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.200]   from playing the game so many times
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.820]   and came up with very novel opening ideas.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.940]   - Were you impressed by AlphaZero?
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.180]   Have you seen some of the games?
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.420]   - I have seen some of the games.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   I think impressed, bewildered, and motivated
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.380]   were the three things I experienced.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.660]   - Like I think Magnus said,
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.980]   he was also impressed that it could easily
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.980]   be mistaken for creativity.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.780]   That's his trash talk towards the AI.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.340]   - That was a beautiful sentence.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.460]   I was listening to the podcast.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.100]   - I mean, as a human, I agree with him,
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.380]   'cause you don't wanna give the machine
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.420]   the power of creativity,
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.420]   but if it looks creative, give it a compliment.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.340]   - That's fair.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.300]   I know that you're being nice to the machines
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.180]   in case they are ever looking back through this.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.180]   - What else is there?
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.940]   What other principles are there for the opening?
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.820]   - You can go a little bit more forward, let's say.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.820]   - Yeah, we can finish full development.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.260]   - Positions like this,
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.820]   let's just say you developed all of your pieces.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.500]   - So that's like a really nice,
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.660]   like nobody took any pieces
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.780]   and we're just in a nice positional thing.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.540]   - Yeah, so it's not actually a very accurate.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.740]   - Yeah, it's not too realistic.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.100]   - I could put a different one on the board,
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.100]   but usually after you've developed all of your pieces,
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.420]   you wanna get your queen out a little bit
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.660]   to connect your rooks,
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.260]   and you also start thinking about certain pawn pushes
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.140]   and getting more space.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.180]   But another good tip is just,
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.820]   can you improve the position of your pieces?
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:16.860]   Think about timing.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.940]   So if you've already moved a piece once
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.540]   and there's a piece that hasn't moved at all,
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.380]   then you wanna focus on the piece that hasn't moved at all
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.660]   to be able to have it more likely to jump into the game.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.620]   - Right, so don't move pieces multiple times.
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:29.460]   - Exactly.
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.420]   - Like try to move it to the most optimal position.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.260]   - Yeah.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.420]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.420]   So what's the Indian,
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.740]   I think we kind of went over it,
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.860]   but did you ever say why you like it so much?
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.420]   'Cause it's weird, 'cause it's king side?
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:48.180]   - I liked it because it's a very fun, aggressive defense
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.940]   where you're just throwing your pieces towards white,
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.700]   and there's so many sacrificing opportunities.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.300]   And for some reason, tactical games always feel
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.220]   like the most beautiful, the most satisfying.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.100]   And that's what I liked about the King's Indian.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.340]   But I also suffered a lot from this love
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.540]   because I would play things
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.420]   that are not necessarily correct,
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.020]   then my attack wouldn't pan out,
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.780]   and then I would just struggle the rest of the game
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.580]   having no play and just trying to defend.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.460]   - So if you're always,
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.900]   Wikipedia also says that,
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.740]   that you're known for your attacking play.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.620]   - It's also known for losses according to Stanford.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.860]   - Okay, let's not bring that up.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.860]   - Let's see, Wikipedia doesn't talk trash.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.700]   It just says nice things.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.140]   - Yeah, Wikipedia's a lot nicer.
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.660]   I actually played a lot of positional chess in classic
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.340]   'cause I really like the slow squeeze.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.660]   But when I transitioned to playing a lot of online chess,
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.620]   it's almost as if I was looking
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.340]   for more instant gratification
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:44.300]   'cause it feels so much better
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.340]   to beat someone with an attack.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.340]   And even if sometimes it doesn't pan out,
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.300]   I was okay with it 'cause you get so many games in.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.220]   So I think my style in online chess
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.340]   really changed from my classical chess.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.180]   - What about you, Andrea?
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.220]   Do you have a style?
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.180]   Are you attacking?
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.780]   Are you more like conservative defensive player?
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.700]   Are you chaotic?
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.260]   - Opening-wise, I like to play more positionally.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.740]   Like I like to push T4 and just slowly improve my pieces
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.780]   and slowly get an attack.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.460]   But like Alex said, if you're playing bullet chess
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.540]   or blitz against viewers,
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:19.220]   you often like wanna play riskier moves
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.700]   that may not be as good.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.140]   And then that's kind of when I would play more aggressive.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.380]   But I do enjoy tournaments for that reason
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.180]   'cause then like once you're 15 moves in,
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.460]   which as soon as you're out of your prep,
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:33.860]   I like sitting and thinking in more positional,
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.300]   yeah, positional middle games.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.900]   - One of the games you've found to be pretty cool
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.820]   is the Hakkar and Nakamura versus Galfond in 2009.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.700]   And that one, I think, includes the Kings Indian defense.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.540]   - Yes.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.220]   - Why is that an interesting one to you?
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.140]   - I also play the Kings Indian as black
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:56.220]   and I love this model game.
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.140]   But, and as Alex was saying,
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.420]   like all these advantages for the Kings Indian,
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.140]   but now there's this one line
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.340]   that like every higher rated player
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.580]   just destroys my Kings Indian.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.540]   And you see these beautiful games and like,
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.620]   ah, yes, I wanna play for these ideas,
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.260]   but now no one plays into it anymore
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.420]   and you just get demolished.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.340]   So this is why I don't play the Kings Indian anymore,
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.420]   but not to ruin the fun.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.260]   - It's a love-hate relationship, truly.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.300]   - The reality.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.940]   - But that's like the higher level players do
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:21.780]   or does everybody?
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.500]   - Yeah, if you're studying openings
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.420]   and you know this line as white,
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.900]   you just, you automatically get the upper edge.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.700]   - And that's kind of how openings develop.
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.780]   You start having players trying new lines
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.180]   and then you see ones and then everybody adopts it
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.540]   if they think it's the best one.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.460]   But yeah, so Hikaru is really known
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.940]   for his aggressive style of play.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.140]   - Is Hikaru black here or what?
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.220]   - Yeah, Hikaru is black here.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.220]   So he's playing the Kings Indian
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.500]   and as you can see in this position,
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.260]   white already has a lot, a huge center advantage,
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.820]   but what Hikaru is gonna start doing,
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.180]   even with the next move,
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.580]   is bringing all of his pieces towards the white king side
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.460]   because his plan is to start pushing his pawns
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.300]   towards the white king and ignore the attack
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.140]   that goes on in the queen side.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.820]   - This is a great example of the dream attack
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.860]   with the Kings Indian.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.900]   - So there's a complete asymmetry towards the king side
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.660]   on the left side of the board is a ton of pieces.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:13.740]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.380]   - Wow, he moved the knight like three times in a row.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.100]   - Yep, and that's what you need to do
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.620]   'cause you have to move the knight
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.620]   in order to make space for your pawn.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.820]   So again, this is why it's so counterintuitive
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.380]   and Stockfish doesn't like it.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.820]   You're putting almost most of your pieces on the back rank
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.580]   and you're pushing your king side pawns
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.540]   and you're blocking your own dark squared bishop.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.420]   So none of it makes sense.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.780]   - You're mimicking it, that's awesome.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.660]   - Okay, so yeah, here you see white going
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:40.900]   for a queen side attack,
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.660]   black going for the king side attack
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:43.940]   and you can keep going a little bit
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.740]   and I'll wait to where he starts with the pretty sacrifices.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.300]   - It's more fun to analyze games in person
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.500]   than on the computer, I think.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.340]   - Yeah.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:57.300]   - Okay, so here Hikaru is preparing the attack
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.140]   and what I really like about this game
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.580]   is that he finds these tactics
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:05.220]   that are not necessarily what a computer would go for,
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.740]   but it's very hard to face as a human
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.860]   and that's why a lot of people play the Kings Indian
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.140]   because in practice, it's hard to defend against.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.340]   So we can keep moving a little bit forward.
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.500]   Okay.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:21.780]   Yep, so white is just continuing the king side plan.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.940]   - Now is that like the first piece,
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.220]   I think that's taken in the game?
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.580]   - Yep, that's the first trade.
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:27.900]   - So he begins.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.740]   - Exactly, Hikaru had to pause his attack for a little bit
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.380]   to just make sure that white didn't have two dire threats
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.300]   on the queen side.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.540]   - So cool to see the asymmetry of this thing.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.300]   - Exactly, that's what's beautiful
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.140]   about the Kings Indian.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.340]   - And just one thing to highlight
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.220]   'cause his rook move here is very bizarre
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:47.020]   and typically like a computer probably didn't like this,
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.860]   but the ideas are very interesting
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.100]   'cause this is a major weakness for black
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.700]   that they're coming to attack
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.620]   and he's also making room for his bishop
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.100]   to come backwards and challenge.
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.140]   So this is like a human-like maneuver
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:58.980]   that computers wouldn't like.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.460]   - I think computers would like this though
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.460]   'cause you'd have to move it regardless
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:03.940]   'cause he takes the pawn here
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.700]   and his rook would be under attack.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.820]   - Yeah, well, having looked at it,
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.340]   when I actually studied this as a line
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.980]   and this right away isn't the best move
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.820]   for a current computer.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.180]   - So actually, that's just a good question.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.700]   So do you guys, when you study games,
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.060]   use your own mind, but do you also use computers
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.420]   to build up your intuition?
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.900]   Of like looking at a position like this
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.380]   and what would a computer do
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.820]   and then try to understand why it wants to do that?
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.580]   - When I was studying seriously,
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.580]   I would try to use my own mind
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.420]   because you're never gonna get the exact same position
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.540]   so you really need to notice trends
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.300]   and often computers will give you moves
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.060]   that are only specific to that position
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.340]   because of a certain tactic.
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.020]   But I do use computers to check what I did
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.820]   and make sure I didn't make any obvious blunder
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.980]   that I might've missed.
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.020]   - What does a computer tell you?
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.060]   Just like what is the best move
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.580]   or does it give you any kind of explanation of why?
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.100]   - It doesn't tell you why,
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.060]   but it gives you the different valuations of the position
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   like black is down a half pawn here or something like that.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.580]   But it hints you towards what the right move is
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.660]   and then it's on you to figure out why.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.300]   And you can usually figure out why if not right away
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.700]   than just by going through a few moves
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.900]   and being like, "Oh, okay, that makes sense."
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.060]   - I feel like a computer will take you down
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.980]   with some weird lines potentially.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.580]   - Sometimes. - Like sacrifice,
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.020]   like why the hell am I sacrificing this?
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.380]   - Well, we'll get to the pretty sacrifice soon.
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.900]   So we could just keep playing for a little bit.
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.500]   - The pawns are being pushed forward?
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.340]   - Yeah.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:33.860]   And Hikaru is kind of ignoring the queen side attack here.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:37.300]   They basically both only reply to each other's plan
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:38.340]   when they have to.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.980]   - This is where you convert all the podcast viewers
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.220]   to YouTube.
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:44.060]   - Yeah.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.260]   - They have no idea what we're talking about right now.
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.300]   - There is a Zen experience of just listening and imagining.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.140]   - The board.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:52.300]   - Just imagine that- - Imagine the pieces
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.140]   on the ceiling.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.260]   - Yeah, we should be calling them out
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.940]   and then people will be freaking out even more.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.540]   Am I supposed to keep track of what the position is?
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:02.180]   - It's too late now, it's too many.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.500]   - How hard is blindfold chess?
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.340]   Have you tried?
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.620]   Are you able to keep the board-
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.500]   - I've played blindfold chess before.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.700]   For me, it's pretty hard.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.380]   It's not a muscle that I've trained as much
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.540]   and I'm very visual when it comes to chess,
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.900]   but it is one as a top player
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.100]   that starts becoming very second nature for you.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.100]   - Actually, this is what, I talked to Magnus about this.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.460]   Maybe I was, again, influenced by Queen's Gambit.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.220]   What do you actually visualize when it's in your head?
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.420]   So for Magnus, it was a boring 2D board.
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:32.260]   - Right.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.100]   - Do you have some kind of-
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.780]   - Does every chess player know?
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:35.620]   - You don't have like,
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.540]   'cause you know some chess, like computer games,
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.820]   you can do all kinds of skins and like fancy stuff.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.660]   You don't have anything fancy?
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.940]   - Sadly, I don't have like a cool 3D warrior mode on.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.780]   It's just the basic.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.060]   - I just have a default chess-based board in my head.
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.860]   'Cause you don't, yeah, you can't use your brain power
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.260]   for adding colors to it
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.340]   'cause you already have to keep track of the pieces.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.980]   - As one board at a time?
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.060]   - Yes.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.060]   - The current position.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.260]   - Yeah, I bet every chess,
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.900]   I wonder if there's any who-
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.500]   - There's certain players who are really good
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.340]   and they can even play blindfold chess
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.560]   and play multiple games at the same time.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.500]   So I would be curious how they do it.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.180]   But usually when you're thinking of one game,
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.020]   that's the only one in your mind.
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.540]   - Yeah, but you have to do this operation
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.700]   where you move one piece,
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.820]   you're doing like the branch analysis.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:23.700]   - Yeah.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.460]   - And so you still have to somehow visualize
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:31.380]   the branching process and not forget stuff.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:34.660]   Maybe that's like constant memory recall or something.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.660]   You're always looking at one board at a time, but-
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.500]   - And you're also, oh,
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.900]   'cause you're also looking in the future?
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:39.740]   - Yeah.
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:40.580]   - Yeah.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:41.400]   - 'Cause then you have to backtrack to-
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.140]   - I guess you're keeping the position in your memory.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.900]   So you're remembering where all the pieces are
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.260]   and then you're playing it out on one board
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.700]   and then you can come back to the initial one
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.300]   that you started with that you kind of just
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.260]   keep in your brain.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.300]   And it's also easier to come back to it
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.580]   once you've played a position from it.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:02.580]   - I feel like it's that memory recall
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.740]   that gets you to blunder.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:09.140]   So I'll like see that I'm being attacked by certain things,
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.540]   but then because I get so exhausted
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:12.980]   thinking about a different thing,
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.500]   I actually forget about an entire branch of things
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.340]   that I was supposed to be worried about.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.940]   - Yeah, it happens very often.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:20.940]   Yeah, if you spend a bunch of time
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.120]   calculating in a position, let's say,
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.140]   like when you're really in trouble
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.780]   and you're spending 15, 20 minutes calculating,
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.780]   you'll forget about something that you spotted.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.660]   Like, oh, if I do these two, three moves,
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.060]   I'll walk into a trap
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.300]   'cause you've looked at so many lines
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.820]   and then you play it and then you see it
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.060]   and you're like, oh, I looked at it and I saw it,
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.980]   but I forgot about it.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:40.700]   - It's often called tunneling
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:42.880]   where you're just looking so deeply on one thing,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.100]   you forget about the rest of the board.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.920]   - And it's the worst when, at least in a beginner level,
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.300]   there's like a, I don't know, a bishop just sitting there,
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.820]   obviously attacking your queen or something.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:57.580]   And then you just forget that bishop exists.
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.420]   'Cause if they just sit there for a few moves
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.860]   and don't move, you just forget their existence.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.220]   And then it's just, yeah,
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.660]   that's definitely very embarrassing.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.500]   - Well, it happens to everyone, so.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.340]   - Yes.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.420]   Okay, cool.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:15.980]   - Okay, so we see a few trades happening on the queen side
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.920]   where he had to go for those, otherwise he's in trouble.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.140]   And this is where the game, oh, sorry.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.940]   - This is where it gets exciting.
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:28.860]   - Yeah, so knight H4 is really when the sacrifice starts.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.580]   And here, the two important pawns
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.820]   are the ones in front of the king,
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.860]   'cause they're helping with the entire defense.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.780]   And Hikaru's actually preparing to sacrifice his knight
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.460]   for a pawn just so that he can continue his attack
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.800]   and open up the position.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.760]   Because if you don't do that, here as black,
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.020]   and don't get some kind of attack,
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.180]   you are completely lost on the queen side.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.940]   And also, you've pushed all of your own king side pawns,
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.100]   so you're gonna be in danger.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.780]   So it's one of those do or die moments.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.700]   - Oh, okay, so that's what makes it all in,
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:58.860]   'cause the king is wide open.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.100]   - Yeah, yeah, the king is wide open,
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.900]   and all of white's pieces are pointed
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.100]   towards the queen side too, where you're also cramped.
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.980]   - So it's the attack primarily by black
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.300]   done by the two pawns and the knight.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.500]   - And the light squared bishop
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.140]   is always extremely important. - Oh, there it is.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.220]   - So you don't wanna trade this in the king's Indian,
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.460]   because it's very helpful for a lot of attacks.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.940]   - Even though it's on the other side of the board.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:20.780]   - Yeah. - I guess it can go
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:24.460]   all the way across in, like, I'm not sure
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.100]   what it's doing here, but probably threatening.
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.900]   - Like, for example, if it was another move
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.020]   black could have played, would be something like bishop H3,
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.220]   where if you take the bishop,
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:35.420]   you actually get mated on G2.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:36.260]   - With what?
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.500]   - So let's say you take here,
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.220]   and then you could push the pawn,
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.940]   and then it would be checkmate.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.460]   So you're kinda using your bishop to sacrifice
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.420]   against white's king side pawns.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.540]   - Yeah, I'll be freaking out if their bishop did that.
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.780]   - Exactly. - What are they up to?
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.180]   - Right, and that's the thing,
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.300]   this position looks very scary as white,
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:56.700]   because all of black's pawns
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.580]   are starting to come towards you,
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.220]   and it's one of those things where humans do start to worry
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.380]   in these positions, whereas computers, obviously,
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.820]   can just calculate the best line,
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.540]   and maybe the attack doesn't go through.
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.220]   - So you're saying a computer might say
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.140]   that the white is actually a slight favorite here.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.660]   - Yeah, potentially. - That's possible.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.020]   Okay, so then white makes a little bit of room
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.460]   by moving the rook. - Right.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.940]   - And the attack begins.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:21.820]   - I like the commentary here.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:22.660]   (laughing)
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:26.220]   - The knight is hugging the king.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.820]   - And actually, white can't even take the king here,
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.420]   because then h4 and h3 is coming in.
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.660]   - White can't take the knight.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.860]   - Yeah, oh, did I say king?
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.100]   Yes, thank you, the knight.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.460]   - White can't take the knight, because why?
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.420]   - So if white takes the knight here,
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.020]   then black starts pushing his pawn to h4,
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:45.420]   with h3 incoming, and the idea of trying
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:49.820]   to defend against this is, it looks very difficult.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.220]   So white just chooses.
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.220]   - It'd be cool to watch a chess game,
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.980]   to experience watching it without understanding it,
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:56.820]   just for a day.
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.460]   I feel like I could use that to make better content.
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:00.300]   - True.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.180]   Okay, yeah.
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.380]   - I mean, that's what getting drunk does.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:04.220]   (laughing)
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.740]   - Unfortunately for chess players,
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.620]   it never leaves you for that.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.860]   Doesn't matter how.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.860]   - But this is actually a very cute move,
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.500]   because black's queen is under attack,
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.860]   but the king is so cramped that he can't actually take it,
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.660]   or he's gonna get checkmated by a pawn,
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:20.900]   which is a sad way to go, truly.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.220]   - Yeah, those pawns are doing a lot of work here.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:24.860]   - They really are. - That is the king's Indian.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:26.700]   - This is the king's Indian player's dream.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:29.100]   - The attack of the king's side pawns.
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:31.260]   - Yeah, these pawns are like, right,
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:32.380]   so they're the ones that are doing
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.820]   a lot of the threatening.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.980]   - Right, and they're also opening up the position
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.660]   to bring more of the pieces in,
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:41.580]   but the pawns kind of help break open the king's side,
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.580]   but they can't checkmate by themselves,
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:44.900]   so after the pawns come in,
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.780]   that's when you need to start bringing in pieces as well,
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.940]   which you will see.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.380]   - Ah, he carded you here.
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.220]   Okay. - There you go.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.580]   He puts-- - One more sacrifice.
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:54.300]   - Yes, so this was actually another beautiful sacrifice
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.260]   in the game.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:59.100]   - But then puts the king in check with a pawn.
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.140]   - Right, and the pawn is going to be given here for free,
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.220]   but the idea is you're giving your own piece
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.700]   because you want to have more space and open up the king,
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.300]   which is what you're always trying to do
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.140]   when you have a king's side.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.220]   You're trying to remove as many of the king's defenders
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.620]   as you can without giving up too much of--
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.700]   - And then you have a ton of pieces on the king's side
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:21.380]   for black just waiting to-- - Exactly.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.220]   - To do harm, and then--
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.820]   - And notice how every single move white is getting attacked.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.480]   Like, they're just never getting a break.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.020]   Black just keeps throwing all their pieces.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.540]   - So it's funny that black's queen has been hanging
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.920]   for like three moves now,
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.660]   and white still can't do anything about it.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.900]   - Yeah, so rook puts the king in check.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.220]   - Yep. - The king runs.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.020]   - And then, again, we leave the queen hanging,
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.180]   and you develop a piece,
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.900]   the slight squared bishop, that's so important,
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.060]   and you're once again threatening checkmate on G2.
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:53.180]   - And then bishops coming to--
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.900]   - Yeah, once again, the queen hanging.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.520]   - I mean, the game is just so beautiful,
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.520]   the amount of calculation Hikaru put into this position.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.340]   - It just feels like so much is in danger.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.940]   - Right. - It's so interesting.
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.820]   And knight takes what, a pawns.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.180]   - So now his queen is attacked twice,
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.940]   and he doesn't care.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.860]   He takes the bishop,
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.780]   and he's still threatening the checkmate on G2.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:21.180]   - And then the queen takes the bishop.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.340]   - Yep, so now he's defending against G2,
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:29.700]   and black just goes and grabs some material back here.
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.340]   - So here, black is already winning.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.180]   - Well, he ends up winning a knight here,
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.200]   because black had to be so much on the defensive.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.380]   - He's just taking pieces.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.420]   - Yeah, I mean, at this point,
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.860]   you're up two whole pieces,
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.260]   so you would-- - Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.100]   - But--
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.320]   - And queen. - Queen.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.220]   And then you take, and then the rook takes,
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.700]   and there's not as much of an attack on the king anymore,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.700]   but Hikaru is up a knight here, which is GG.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.780]   - Yeah, what's the correct way of saying that?
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.980]   'Cause I played Demis Asabas, I played him in chess,
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.820]   and then I quickly realized,
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.380]   like from his facial expressions,
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:16.500]   that I should've stopped playing.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.780]   - Oh. - It was like,
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:19.940]   it's already set. - Yeah, when it's--
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:24.660]   - And then he's like, "This is a good time to give up."
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.780]   - Right. - "You're not gonna get
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.980]   "the checkmate," where, like, he could see,
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.420]   the checkmate is five or seven moves away or something.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.780]   And what's the play?
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.700]   - Usually, you have to resign if you're in a position,
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.460]   or you should, through chess etiquette,
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.820]   resign when you're in a position where your opponent
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.700]   is definitely gonna win out of respect,
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.540]   like if you're a piece down.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.660]   And obviously, all top grandmasters do that.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.940]   The only people who don't do that is kids,
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:55.020]   'cause their coaches-- - They love to play
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.420]   'til the checkmate. - Their coaches always tell
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.380]   them never resign, and they'll be in hopelessly lost
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:02.460]   positions, playing against, like, two rooks, a king,
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.980]   and they only have their sole king,
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.820]   but they're still playing on.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.020]   So that's a position where it's obvious they can't win.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.620]   - 'Cause the kids might make errors.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.300]   - Yeah, exactly. - And so might as well,
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.780]   that was the interesting thing about, I think,
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.780]   game six of the previous World Championship with Magnus.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.420]   - Was it the one where he beat Neb?
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.300]   - Yeah, the first time he beat him, where it was like,
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.020]   he said that, I don't know how often you come across
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.020]   this kind of situation, he said,
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:32.020]   "The engines predict a draw, but that doesn't mean
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.380]   "that it's going to be a draw."
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:38.380]   So you play on, hoping that you take a person into,
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.500]   I mean, this is, I guess, an endgame thing.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.460]   You take them into deep water and they make
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.860]   a positional mistake or something.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.020]   I don't know when, like, he, from his gut,
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.740]   knows that this is supposed to be a draw,
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.060]   but he still plays on.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:53.980]   - Yeah, I mean, that is one where it could theoretically
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.860]   be a draw, but it could be very hard to defend,
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:59.700]   'cause it's a hard technique to know as a human.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.820]   And especially in that game, I know that Neppo
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.660]   was also in time pressure, which makes it even harder.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.940]   So in situations like that, you should always continue.
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.220]   It's more where an engine would give you something
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:14.500]   like plus 10 or something where it's not just clearly a win,
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.060]   but anybody would know how to win,
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.860]   and that's where you're usually supposed to resign.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.820]   - So what do you find beautiful about this game?
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.820]   Is it the attacking chess and just the asymmetry of it?
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:31.660]   - It's the asymmetry, and it's the fact that this is
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.900]   the dream for the King's Indian, where you're able
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:38.100]   to get a beautiful attack, and there's also those two
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.620]   really nice sacrifices where Black just continuously
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.060]   kept putting pressure on White's King to the point
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.140]   where he was able to win material.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.700]   And the best part of it is that if the attack
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.460]   didn't work out, Black would have been completely lost.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.980]   - How often does that happen, by the way?
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.060]   Like as an attacking player, how often do you put yourself
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.820]   in the position of like, I'm screwed unless this works out?
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.100]   - In online chess, more than I should,
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.640]   and it's usually when I sacrifice, I know it's either
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.480]   gonna work or I'm lost.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.540]   And those are the most fun positions to play, usually.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.940]   - But in tournaments, if you're doing a sacrifice,
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.660]   you're playing it with 100% confidence,
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.580]   'cause you're taking the time to calculate it.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.940]   But yeah, when you have three minutes, you don't have time,
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.300]   so you take a whim and you follow your intuition,
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.020]   and you find out later.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.380]   - Or you're very confident it'll work,
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.540]   and you haven't calculated all the way until the end,
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.400]   but you've calculated to the point where you have enough
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.300]   in exchange for the stack, and you think you could
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.860]   play that position.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.820]   - How do you train chess these days?
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:45.780]   Do you practice, do you do deliberate practice?
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.020]   I mean, you're in this tough position because you're also
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.620]   a creator, an educator, an entertainer,
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:54.680]   so do you try to put in time of like daily practice?
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:00.340]   - I don't train chess anymore when I'm focusing on creating.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.920]   I do if I'm preparing for a tournament,
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.580]   but back in the day, I would train very tournament,
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.140]   very seriously for tournaments,
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:10.820]   and the way it would work is I'd do opening preparation
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.940]   for a specific tournament, because that's when
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.460]   you really need to have those lines memorized,
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.740]   and you could also prepare for specific opponents,
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.800]   and I would do tactics to make sure I stay sharp.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.080]   So those are the two things I would do every single day
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.060]   for a tournament, and then mix up the rest
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.380]   with like maybe some end games,
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.020]   maybe some positional chess.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.660]   - So what does tactics preparation look like?
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:34.820]   Do you do like a puzzle, like a random puzzle thing?
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.740]   - Yeah, I would just train puzzles
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.740]   for at least like 30 to 60 minutes, or books,
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.160]   and sometimes you were, and there's different kinds
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.740]   of puzzles, one you could train for pattern recognition,
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.860]   where you're supposed to go through them very quickly,
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.620]   and that's just so that when you're playing the game,
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:51.900]   if your mind is tired, it's still keeping track of things
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.640]   a little bit more easily, and then there's where
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.100]   you're practicing your combination,
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.380]   and those sometimes take like 20 minutes to find,
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.540]   'cause you have to just calculate a lot,
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:02.440]   and it's more like making sure that you've trained
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.880]   with that muscle, but Andrea's actually very good
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.020]   at finding ways to balance and still study
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.320]   while also doing content.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.640]   - Yeah, so what, you're able to do both?
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.660]   - That's the hard thing.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.760]   I was getting very irritated with content,
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.840]   because I'm very competitive, and I don't like playing chess
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.240]   if I'm losing, and if you're talking and entertaining,
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.540]   you're gonna be losing more games than winning.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.800]   So then I started doing more training streams,
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.080]   where I'd bring on my coach, and one of the things
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.580]   that I wanted to add to Alex's training repertoire,
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.760]   so I would do daily puzzles every time I'm streaming,
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.600]   which helped me a lot, even if it's like,
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.460]   there's this thing on chess.com called Puzzle Rush,
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.160]   where you have three minutes, and you just do
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.560]   puzzle after puzzle, where they get incrementally harder,
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.280]   and it's just a really good way to build
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.780]   your pattern recognition, especially when you're rusty.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.520]   So I would do that 'til I hit a high score,
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.840]   and I wouldn't play any blitz until I hit the score
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.040]   that I want, but that's kind of more like
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.000]   the fun part of chess studying.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.820]   The very important one is actually analyzing
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.500]   your losses in your tournament games,
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.560]   and first you sit and you look through your mistake yourself
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.120]   and try to see if you can find the better moves,
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.760]   and then that's when you would check over
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.900]   with the computer to see if you're right.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.800]   So game analysis is also very important, which I try to do.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.000]   - I remember to give a shout out, I listened to a couple
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.480]   of episodes of the Perpetual Chess podcast,
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.320]   which is pretty good, but whatever I listened to,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.520]   I remember the, it's, I think they really focus on
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.120]   like teaching people--
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.080]   - How to train.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.960]   - Yeah, how to play, how to train, all that kind of stuff.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.640]   They do like, yeah, I'm looking now, adult improver.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.640]   So basically, like how do regular noobs get better at chess?
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.060]   One of the things that, one of the person that said,
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.880]   I think he was the grandmaster, but he said,
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.200]   to maximize the amount of time you spend every day
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.320]   of like, basically, as you were saying, like suffering.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.560]   So like, you, it's not about the, like,
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.680]   you should be thinking, you should be doing calculating.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.280]   So it's the opposite of what Magnus said,
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.600]   like you should be doing a lot of time.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.220]   It doesn't matter what the puzzle is
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.720]   or whatever the hell you're doing,
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.740]   but you should be like doing that difficult calculation.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.720]   That's how you get better.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.480]   - Yeah, it really depends what you're training,
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.800]   'cause I used to think the same,
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.360]   but it depends what your weaker at,
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.080]   'cause if you're doing the really difficult puzzles,
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.320]   you're training for like visualization
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.440]   and calculating more moves ahead than you typically would,
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.280]   which maybe you wouldn't get into that
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.040]   as often in a regular game,
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.800]   because typically you run into like three to four tactics,
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.720]   which are actually the easier and more fun ones to solve.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.280]   So it really depends.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.600]   - And on top of that, as a hobbyist,
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.720]   your motivation is very different
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.560]   than when you're playing from a young age
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.880]   and have pretty high competitive ambition.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.340]   And a lot of people who are new to chess,
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.040]   you could basically work on anything
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.560]   and still improve.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.360]   So if you're focusing on something you like,
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.920]   you're probably gonna stick to it more
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.080]   and be more consistent,
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.520]   which I think is more helpful long-term.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.360]   - What was the most embarrassing loss of your career?
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.880]   - I had so many flashbacks,
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.400]   but I'm so glad it's a question for Andrea.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.400]   - I like that you specified.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.640]   You know, it's funny 'cause-
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.520]   (laughing)
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.480]   - I mean, because you said you're so competitive
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.600]   and like I could tell just even from the way you said it,
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.280]   like you hate losing.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.560]   - Yeah, I mean, that was the reason I hated chess
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.880]   in high school 'cause it always be like,
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.480]   but okay, there's many traumatizing losses
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.800]   where it's like you're top three,
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.880]   you're running for first,
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.360]   and then you throw a game you shouldn't.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.300]   But, and this shouldn't hurt my ego as much as it does,
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.280]   but it's always kids,
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.000]   or when I was a high school girl,
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.560]   it's the younger boys who are really cocky.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.720]   And when they win, they start rubbing it in your face
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.440]   and they're yawning and looking around
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.560]   when like 90% of the game you were destroying them
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.040]   and you had this one tiny mistake
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.000]   and now their ego's huge.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:57.980]   But I'll never forget,
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:01.400]   I was playing like for a chess scholarship
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.280]   and it was tiebreaker for first.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.160]   And I think I lost to a 12 year old girl
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   who couldn't even use the scholarship,
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.640]   but she beat me in one first place
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.500]   and she got some other prize.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.960]   So yeah, I was losing to that little girl
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.480]   who's literally like 2,300 now, so makes sense.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.840]   - Right, you keep telling yourself that.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.960]   What do you think,
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.380]   do you think Gaspar was feeling that
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.560]   when he was playing 13 year old Magnus?
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.080]   Like, why?
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.680]   - As much as it's a beauty of the sport
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.800]   that any age can be brilliant,
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.080]   any demographic, anything,
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.440]   I feel like when you're adults
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.280]   and you're paired against a kid,
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.760]   it's just hard not to let it get to you.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.880]   And it depends, maybe if they're a really sweet kid,
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.920]   but most times I play kids, they're just really arrogant.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.840]   And I don't think they do it intentionally
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.680]   'cause they're kids.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.240]   - I mean, there is a certain etiquette thing
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.920]   like you said, yawning and in general.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.600]   - You're kids, there's no etiquette.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.840]   - They don't care.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.560]   - Yeah, the kids traumatized me too.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.640]   I was playing in Vegas and it was not even my opponent,
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.440]   it was the board next to me.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.760]   And the kid was at least 10 years old,
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.640]   12 max, and he was playing against an adult
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.160]   and he takes out his hand
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.240]   and he starts doing a fake phone
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.440]   to which the kid sitting across diagonally
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.880]   picks up their banana and starts talking
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.920]   like it's a phone and they're just mouthing words
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.680]   while their two adult opponents
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.400]   are thinking intensely at the game.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.680]   And then I see the adult look up, look at the kid
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.480]   just making banana phone and the despair in his eyes
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.120]   as he sighs.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.320]   - Yeah, and they're not even doing it for trash talk.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.640]   - No, no, no, they're just bored kids.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.960]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.680]   - Well, what was the, 'cause you play a bunch of people
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.520]   for your channel, what was the most memorable?
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.120]   What's the most fun, most intense?
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.100]   There's a bunch of fun ones.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.680]   You've played kids before, some trash talking kids.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.160]   - That sounds great.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.840]   They trash talk kids.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.680]   - Yeah.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.720]   - Nothing like losing to a 12 year old
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.080]   who then starts doing a Fortnite dance.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.520]   - Yeah, so that actually happened?
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.680]   - That did happen.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.600]   He is a very young master.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.680]   I think he became master when he was like nine years old
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.200]   or something and he's very good at chess
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.520]   and doing a lot of training,
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.720]   but he's also incredibly good at trash talking
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.760]   and he beat me one game and he stood up
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.760]   and he started doing the Fortnite dance.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.420]   So, you gotta just swallow your pride in those moments.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:25.300]   - What is that culture of street chess players?
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.520]   It seems pretty interesting.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.540]   I don't know, that seems to be celebrating
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.620]   the beauty of the game.
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.380]   It's the trash talking, but also having fun with it,
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.300]   but also taking it seriously.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.940]   And you've done a few of those.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.620]   Did you go to New York?
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:42.300]   - Yeah, in Union Square Park in Washington Square.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.900]   - What was that like?
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.000]   - It's such a unique place.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.760]   I haven't seen it anywhere else in the US
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.680]   where people are just professional chess hustlers,
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:55.800]   even if they're not necessarily a top player,
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.120]   but they play chess every single day.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.240]   And so many of them learn chess by themselves
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:03.160]   and never had a professional coach,
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.000]   so they are quite good at it.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.780]   They're also very tight knit.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.360]   They all know each other and it's a very social thing
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.320]   where you're not just playing chess,
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.540]   it's the experience of getting to know this person
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.400]   who's very much a personality and they talk to you.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.100]   They could either give you tips
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.320]   or they could be really chatty and talk to you during.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.040]   So it's a chess experience rather than just playing a game.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.160]   - Do you tell them what your rating is
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.560]   or do you just let people,
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.040]   both ways, do you discover how good the person actually is?
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.600]   - Initially I loved going and not telling people my rating
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.060]   and just surprising them and winning games,
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.740]   but now we've gone so many times that they just know us,
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.360]   so we can't get away with it anymore.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.160]   - One time, actually I don't know if I should share this,
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.200]   but one time we dressed up as grandmothers
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.700]   and we had prosthetics on our face
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.300]   and I think they still recognized us.
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.740]   - Yeah, it's probably the, there's other components,
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.660]   like probably the trash talk and all that kind of stuff.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.260]   - Actually, no, it was funny.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.600]   We were talking like grandmothers,
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.560]   but it was the way I held.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.400]   It was the way I held.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.040]   - Grandmother talk like, back in my day.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.880]   - You don't wanna hear that, you know who it is.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.440]   Ask Blitz for a bonbon if you want some bonbon.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.000]   - We're not bringing this back.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.160]   - Okay, what were your names?
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.160]   - Don't read the code names.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.000]   - Oh my God.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.320]   - I think it was Edna.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.520]   - Edna, and I had a really, I can't remember the other one,
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.440]   but it was embarrassing because we were walking so slowly
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.680]   and Andrea dropped her cane or something at one point
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.440]   and then people in the park came to help her
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.880]   and we felt so embarrassed.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.240]   - And I'm like, my bonbons.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.280]   But yeah, it was funny 'cause they didn't know it was us
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.680]   until he saw the way I reached for my pawn
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.240]   and he said, "The way you held your pawn,
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.560]   "I knew it was you."
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.800]   It was like such a sneak thing.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.640]   That was what blew the grandma cover.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.120]   - Yeah, do you have a style of how you play physically?
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:47.960]   Is that recognizable?
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.000]   - I didn't think we did until grandma went to play chess.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.120]   - Yeah, I've never thought about that.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.720]   - Yeah, I think our style is just trash talking now.
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.840]   If you're talking about style on YouTube and Twitch,
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.800]   we definitely have a distinctive style.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.640]   - What's that?
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.480]   What's your distinctive?
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.320]   - Just talking shit.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.160]   - Just talking shit?
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.280]   - Yes, but not going too far.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.240]   - No, no, definitely.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240]   That's definitely going to,
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.120]   if it's us two against each other.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.760]   - Oh, we trash talk each other so hard.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.600]   - So brutally.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.800]   - And I love looking at Andrea
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.880]   and watching her little nose scrunch up as she's annoyed
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.840]   and the satisfaction I get when that happens.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   - How many times do you play against each other
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.360]   online publicly?
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.960]   I think I've seen a couple of games.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.200]   - We've played a lot of times.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.440]   We try not to do it too often 'cause it's repetitive,
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.920]   but every now and then when we haven't done it for a while,
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.000]   we'll go at it again.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:37.840]   - What do you mean repetitive?
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.360]   Is that implied trash talk right there?
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.800]   - No, it's just, we play similar openings.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.640]   So you just start seeing the same position too often.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.480]   - Every time.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.240]   - And Andrea's really good at opening.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.080]   So I just start playing bad openings
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.880]   to get her out of her preparation.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.680]   'Cause I don't like opening theory very much.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.920]   I just like playing the game
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.320]   and getting into middle games and end games.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.560]   - But yeah, typically the only time we're playing each other
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.040]   is when we're setting up in the park
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.000]   and we don't have opponents yet and we need content.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.960]   So we just play each other until people show up.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.760]   - But we always put stakes on the line,
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.200]   which makes it very interesting.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.960]   'Cause otherwise it wouldn't be fun to play each other
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.080]   if there's no stakes.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.320]   - Where's the most fun place you've played?
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.400]   Is it New York?
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.240]   - I think so.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.680]   And it was actually when we set up in Times Square one night,
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.680]   we just brought a table with us and chess.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.240]   And it's not even where people usually play chess,
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.640]   but it was so lively.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.960]   There were all of the lights out
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.560]   and so many people just kept stopping by to play chess.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.760]   And it was really one of my favorite streams.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.760]   - Just the opposite of like the classical chess world.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.680]   It's super loud.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.000]   There's music, there's cars,
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.200]   there's street dancers,
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.360]   even some naked people walking around
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.480]   who we had to be careful not to get banned.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:47.160]   But I honestly really like the chaotic environments
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.360]   for chess games.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.880]   'Cause I think it's a good way to break more
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.200]   into the mainstream culture and make it entertaining
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.960]   and appealing to anyone who doesn't know anything
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.320]   about chess.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.160]   So that's what I really like.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.600]   - And also in an authentic way,
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.960]   because it's what we really like about chess
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.480]   when you're just enjoying the game,
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.240]   but also the atmosphere
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.320]   and the people who you're playing with.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.800]   And that's one of the things that I think you see less
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.840]   when you're just thinking of chess as a competitive thing.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.440]   - You've, you mentioned a few other games,
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.160]   like the Bobby Fischer games,
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.200]   the Canada's match,
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.200]   the game of the century,
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.280]   which I feel like is a weird game
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.440]   to call the game of the century
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.880]   when there's still like a few decades left in the century.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:25.720]   But yeah.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.000]   - I mean, it wasn't an official thing.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:27.840]   It was just the chess journalist.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.000]   - It's just like made on a chess article.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.960]   - But it's stuck if you look on Wikipedia.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.720]   This is all I do research wise.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.640]   - Because there's, so that particular one
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.520]   was a 13 year old Fischer
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.960]   and he did a queen sacrifice.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.240]   I wonder, there's that movie searching for Bobby Fischer.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.240]   Was that related?
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.480]   'Cause didn't they have a young,
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.680]   somebody who's supposed to be kind of like Bobby Fischer
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.480]   played by Josh Waitzkin.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.520]   - Yeah, I think he ended up being an international master.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.040]   It wasn't based on Bobby Fischer,
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.240]   it was based on another player,
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.560]   but I liked how they told it through the lens
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.760]   of being inspired by Bobby Fischer.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.880]   - Do you remember that game?
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.160]   Like why do you think it was dubbed the game of the century?
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.040]   It was just journalists being like.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.720]   - I think part of it was the atmosphere
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.040]   where you have the US junior champion
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.200]   who's this 13 year old nobody.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.440]   And it's the first time he's playing
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.200]   in a very competitive landscape
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.800]   against some of the top American players.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   And he goes up against an international master.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.560]   So somebody who's a lot stronger than he is,
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.800]   who's played in Olympiads for the American team.
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.520]   He's having a bad tournament,
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.200]   but then he has this one game
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.960]   where he just shows off his tactical prowess
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.600]   and plays incredibly well.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.400]   And I don't know if this is true,
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.920]   but in the paper clippings of it,
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.160]   they'd say things like grandmasters were by the board
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.640]   and they would say things like,
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.040]   oh, Bobby is lost in this position.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:51.880]   What is he doing?
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.160]   But there's this 13 year old kid
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.080]   who's just playing incredibly well.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.320]   And then that also happened before
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:01.120]   Bobby's started really rapidly improving at chess.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.160]   Not that people knew that,
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.880]   but he kind of seemed like a rising star.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.280]   So I think the game was beautiful,
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.440]   but I also think the idea of a 13 year old kid
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.520]   coming out from nowhere
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.400]   and beating a top American player was very fascinating.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.680]   - And there was aggressive chess
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.840]   and it was interesting ideas.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.960]   - Yep.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.080]   - Yeah, taking big risks.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.920]   It's cool to see a 13 year old do that.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.280]   - Yeah.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.560]   - What about the,
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.280]   you mentioned that his match against Mark Taimano
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.000]   from their 71 candidates match was interesting in some way.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.480]   Why is it interesting to you?
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.200]   Move 45.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.920]   I'm looking at some notes.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.880]   - This is with the Bishop E3.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:41.160]   I think I know which one you're talking about.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.760]   It's, I wouldn't say,
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.640]   a lot of these games on these lists,
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.080]   I think are really great combinations
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.760]   that when tactics come into play,
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.320]   which is what we were talking about,
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.000]   but they're very good at exemplifying lessons.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.320]   This is why you study famous games.
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.880]   So you can apply these lessons to your own games.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.400]   And I think the main takeaway for this one was
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.880]   they were punishing their opponent from steering away
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.560]   from opening principles,
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.200]   which is something that we learned a little earlier,
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.120]   where he delayed the development of his king
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.160]   and put his queen out a little bit too exposed.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.920]   So Bobby Fischer immediately punished that.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.320]   And then there was just like a beautiful combination
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.840]   where it was like a 12 in a row perfect moves,
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.720]   which was a tactic, just winning the game.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.400]   But it only came from punishing those mistakes.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   - The mistake being bringing the queen out?
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.720]   - Bringing the queen out and yeah,
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.840]   not castling your king right away.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.920]   And these were just like opening principles
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.320]   that now they're written in books,
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.360]   but for books you would study these principles
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.480]   by studying games.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:48.120]   - And also I'm looking at some notes,
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.120]   his dominance during the candidates' turn
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.160]   was unprecedented.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.560]   He swept two top grandmasters.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.640]   I mean, that guy's meteoric rise is incredible.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.400]   Sad that I think at whatever, in his 20s,
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.280]   he then quit chess.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.200]   One has to wonder where he could have gone.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:11.200]   - Yeah, it is sad that we lost such a brilliant mind
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.040]   so early on.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.360]   And it's also sad, I think,
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.720]   kind of what ended up happening in his life
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.120]   and the slowly going crazier.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.520]   - Is there some aspect of chess
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.440]   that opens the door to crazy?
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.640]   Like how challenging it is on you,
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.800]   the stress, the anxiety of it, the--
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.800]   - Isolation and being alone.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.760]   - Yeah, 'cause it's a very lonely sport.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.800]   - It is, even to you guys, since you both play it,
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.960]   it's still lonely, the experience of it?
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.960]   - It was when I was competing a lot.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.480]   I think the crazy part of it for me
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.440]   was how obsessed you can get about a board game
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.080]   where you're optimizing your entire life
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.120]   to beat another person at pushing wooden pieces
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.880]   across a board and it doesn't necessarily translate
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.080]   to other things.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.920]   And the fact that so many people
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.080]   spend so much of their life on it,
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.920]   but you can also spend so much of your life
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.660]   because it's so deep and so interesting.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:09.640]   And I mean, I've definitely experienced moments
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.480]   where I didn't want to do anything but chess.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.240]   And I had that before I went to college
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.640]   where I just wanted to take a gap year and focus on chess
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.760]   because I went to high school, we moved a lot,
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.160]   there was always other things going on.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.760]   So I felt like I could never really focus on chess.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.640]   And the one time I could by taking a gap year,
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.040]   I ended up not doing, because my parents really wanted me
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.760]   to go to university right away.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.000]   But I think maybe if I had taken that gap year,
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.640]   I don't know if I would have gone back to school.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.240]   So maybe it wasn't a bad thing.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.840]   - I also say that's pretty universal.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.200]   I think if you want to be the best at anything you do
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.360]   or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.760]   So I don't know if that's only chess.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.920]   - Well, some things, some obsessions are more transferable
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.800]   to a balanced social life.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.400]   - That is true. - Like healthy development.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.600]   - Yeah, chess is a lot less social than most other sports.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.040]   - Yeah, there's something deeply isolating about this game.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.720]   I mean, the great chess players I've met,
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.960]   I mean, it's really competitive too.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.960]   And there's something that you're almost nonstop
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.880]   paranoid about blundering at every level.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.520]   And that develops a person who's really anxious
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:26.280]   about losing versus someone who deeply enjoys perfection
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.840]   or winning and so on.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.280]   It's just this constant paranoia about losing.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.720]   Maybe I'm misinterpreting it,
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:36.720]   but that creates a huge amount of stress
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:41.960]   over thousands of games, especially in a young person.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:45.760]   - And that blundering is such a painful experience
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.880]   because you could be playing a game
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.900]   that you've played for five, six hours,
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:53.960]   and you have one lapse in focus and you blunder
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.600]   and you throw the entire game away.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.240]   And sometimes not just the entire game,
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.240]   but the entire tournament.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.520]   Now you can't place or do anything anymore.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.920]   So you just feel those mistakes so strongly.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.080]   - Yeah, there's no one to blame but yourself.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.200]   - Are you guys hard on yourself?
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.400]   Have you been about losing?
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.600]   Like before you became super famous for streaming,
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.960]   where you could be like, well, fuck this, at least I can.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.200]   - So I was really hard on myself
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.300]   and I went to play a tournament in Canada
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.420]   to try to qualify for the Olympiad team.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:28.820]   And I was like, well, I'm an adult now.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:31.640]   I'm not gonna feel emotional if I lose.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.140]   And then I got there on the first day.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:38.200]   I think I was ranked like fourth in Canada for females.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.740]   - How long ago was this?
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:44.160]   - This was like earlier in the year, actually.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.120]   And I go and I lose to somebody lower rated
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.520]   on the first day.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.520]   And I think it was because I had blundered.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.240]   And I went back to my room and I was like,
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.400]   I am not an adult.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.440]   I'm not eating, I'm not leaving this room.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.540]   I feel terrible and I know I shouldn't,
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:00.080]   but it just cuts so deep.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.280]   And then I actually ended up qualifying
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.780]   for the Olympiad team, but I didn't wanna play
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.400]   'cause I didn't have enough time to train
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.120]   and the losses are so painful.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.960]   I was like, it's not worth it.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.560]   - Yeah, in high school and growing up,
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.280]   I just remember weekends.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.680]   And I think being competitive in any sport,
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.200]   again, probably people relate to this,
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.040]   but just spending weekends crying
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.120]   and even like Alex said, punishing yourself
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.920]   'cause you're disappointed in yourself
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.360]   'cause you fight so hard and you prepare and you study
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.280]   and you're like, oh, yeah.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.880]   But that's, once again, on the bright side though,
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.160]   when you're studying so hard and after a four hour game
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.200]   and you actually are on the opposite end and you win,
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.880]   you feel such a huge rush of dopamine and serotonin
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.340]   and you're on a high from the win.
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:47.720]   So there's also plus sides or you can turn this around.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.440]   But yeah, like Alex said,
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.960]   like losing after preparing for something
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.440]   and fighting on hours and hours
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.800]   is the worst feeling in the world.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.240]   - Did you ever get anything like that with martial arts?
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.000]   - Yeah, so wrestling.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.400]   I wrestled all through high school and middle school.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.800]   Definitely, so it's an individual sport.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.760]   I did a lot of individual sport, tennis,
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.200]   those kinds of things.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.720]   But I think even with wrestling and tennis,
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.500]   you're still on a team.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.820]   You can still like, there's still a camaraderie there.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:15.760]   I feel like with chess,
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:18.440]   especially you go on your own with the tournaments,
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.760]   like you really are alone.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.160]   But I mean, I always personally just had
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.360]   like a very self-critical mind in general.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.200]   I would not.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.640]   This is one of the reasons I decided not to play chess
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.480]   because I think when I was really young,
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.480]   I met somebody who was able to play blindfold chess.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.200]   They were teaching me.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.160]   They were laying in there on the couch,
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.000]   trashed, drinking and smoking.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:42.840]   (laughing)
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.960]   - Sounds like a Russian.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.960]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.900]   They're now a faculty somewhere in the United States.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:53.140]   I forget where, but he making jokes,
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.940]   talking to others and he would move the pieces.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.460]   Like he would yell across the room.
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:03.460]   And I remember thinking that if a person is able to do that,
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:08.020]   then that kind of world you can live in inside your mind,
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.260]   that becomes the chessboard.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.540]   To me, that meant like the chessboard is not just out here.
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:15.520]   It could be in here and you can create
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.840]   these beautiful patterns in your mind.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.840]   I felt like I had such a strong pull towards that
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.520]   where I had to decide either I'm gonna dedicate everything
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.420]   to this or not.
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:30.800]   You can't do half-assed.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.040]   And then that's when I decided to walk away from it
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.320]   because I had so much other beautiful things in my life.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.560]   I love mathematics.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.920]   I loved just everything was beautiful to me.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:44.700]   I thought chess would pull me all in.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:47.540]   And there was nothing like it, I think,
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:49.600]   in my whole life since then.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.400]   I think it's such a dangerous addiction.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.980]   It's such a beautiful addiction, but it's a dangerous one,
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.360]   depending on what your mind is like.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.960]   - It reminds me of something I thought of
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:01.440]   before I stopped competing as much.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.400]   And I'd look at people and think,
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.220]   imagine being so intelligent
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:07.840]   that you could become a grandmaster
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.200]   and yet only spending the rest of your life
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.600]   being a grandmaster.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.600]   'Cause it's one of those things
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.440]   where it does require a lot of mental power,
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.740]   but by doing chess, you're not gonna be able
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.800]   to explore other subjects deeply.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.520]   - Yeah.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.080]   - And not in a way that is bad necessarily,
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.460]   more an admiration and wondering what else could have been.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.800]   Because I've just seen people get to these levels
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.760]   of obsession where it's all they wanna do.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.160]   And they're grandmasters, but they're not even top players.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.080]   So they're never gonna make a living out of it.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.760]   They'll make like maybe 30, 40K a year max.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.760]   They can't even focus on their competitive chess
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.280]   'cause they have to supplement it by teaching
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:45.440]   and doing things they don't like.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.340]   And it's just because of how strong
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.840]   of an obsession it can be.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:52.600]   Because it truly is very intellectually rewarding.
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.400]   And I think that's what people are addicted to
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.360]   in the self-improvement,
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.160]   but you can get that from a lot of other things as well.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.000]   - Well, I think for me,
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.520]   what I was inspired by that stuck with me
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:06.520]   is that a human being could be so good at one thing.
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:11.880]   But to me, that person on the college rink and so on,
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:15.000]   I assumed he was the best chess player in the world.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.780]   Like to be able to play inside your head,
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:22.320]   it just felt like a feat that's incredible.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.440]   And so I fell in love with the idea
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.640]   that I hope to be something like that in my life
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:27.960]   at something.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.320]   It would be pretty cool to be really good at one thing.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.360]   And like life in some sense is a search for the things
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.920]   that you could be that good at.
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.160]   I didn't even think about like how much money does it make
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.400]   or any of that.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.560]   Is can I fall in love with something
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.840]   and make it a life pursuit where I can be damn good at it?
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:50.600]   And the being damn good at it is the source of enjoyment.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:55.220]   Not to win because you wanna win a tournament
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:59.320]   or win because you just wanna be better than somebody else.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.440]   No, it's for the beauty of the game itself
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.520]   or the beauty of the activity itself.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.760]   And then you realize that that's one of the compelling
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.600]   things about chess.
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:10.480]   It is a game with rules and you can win.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.520]   If you wanna be really damn good in some aspect of life
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   like that, it's a harder and weirder pursuit.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.000]   - Don't you feel like you kind of did that
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.160]   with computer science or AI related things?
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.480]   Like getting that level of damn good.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:31.760]   - That's one of the cool things about AI and robotics
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.120]   or intellectual pursuits or scientific pursuits
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.480]   is you can spend until you're 80 doing it.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.960]   So I'm in the early days of that.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.800]   One of the reasons I came to Texas,
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.520]   one of the reasons I didn't wanna pursue an academic career
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:49.040]   at MIT is I wanna build a company.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:52.760]   And so that's, I'm in the early days of that AI company.
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.680]   And so it's an open world to see if I'm actually
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:57.640]   going to be good at it.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:01.160]   But the thing that's there that I've been cognizant
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.120]   of my whole life is that I have a passion for it.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:06.600]   Something within me draws me to that thing.
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.120]   And you have to listen to that voice.
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.720]   So with chess, you're fucked unless you like early on
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:16.200]   are really training really hard.
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.020]   I think life is more forgiving.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:22.560]   You can be world-class at a thing
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.760]   after making a lot of mistakes.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.920]   And after spending the first few decades of your life
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.600]   doing something completely different.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.400]   And chess, it's like an Olympic sport.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:38.620]   There's no perfection is a requirement, is a necessity.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:42.400]   What do you think is that pursuit for you?
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.440]   Like, why did you decide to stream?
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.880]   What drew you?
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.040]   - I like these questions now are really getting deep.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.800]   - Yeah, this is like a therapy session.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.840]   I mean, isn't it terrifying to be in front of a camera?
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:58.200]   - Well, it's terrifying to be in front of five cameras
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.400]   instead of six. - Corrections, six.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.240]   - Six, okay.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.320]   - It's more terrifying for me to try to remember
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.240]   if I actually turn them all.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.600]   Like I mentioned to you off mic,
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.880]   I'm still suffering from a bit of PTSD
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:13.540]   after screwing up a recording of Magnus.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:19.120]   He had to console me because that was the thing
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.680]   is I felt, okay, you wanna build robots.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.320]   If you can't get a camera to even run correctly,
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:30.600]   how are you gonna do anything else in life?
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.080]   - Oh no, don't let it spiral like that.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.240]   - It was spiraling hard and I was just laying there
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.640]   and just feeling sorry for myself.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:40.760]   But I think that feeling, by the way,
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.200]   and the small tangent is really useful.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.160]   I feel like a lot of growing happens when you feel shitty,
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.880]   as long as you can get out of it.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.000]   Don't let it spiral indefinitely.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.600]   But just feeling really, really shitty
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.760]   about everything in my life.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.840]   I was having an existential crisis.
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:02.400]   How will I be able to do anything at all?
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.960]   You're a giant failure, all those kinds of negative voices.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:08.840]   But I think I made some good decisions
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:11.320]   in the week after that.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.160]   - Do you think you couldn't have made those decisions
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.860]   if you were less hard on yourself?
[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:19.600]   - Me personally, no, I'm too lazy.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.040]   - Okay, so you really need to be angry at yourself enough
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.480]   to go and do what you need to do.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.240]   - It's not even angry, it's just upset
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.520]   of being self-critical.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.640]   Also for me personally,
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:33.420]   because I don't have proclivities for depression,
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:39.720]   I have a lot more room to feel extremely shitty about myself.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:45.780]   So if you're somebody that can get stuck in that place,
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.320]   like clinically depressed,
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.900]   you have to be really, really careful.
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:50.300]   You have to notice the triggers,
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.760]   you don't wanna get into that place.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:54.160]   But for me, just looking empirically,
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.200]   feeling shitty has always been productive.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.920]   Like it makes me long-term happier.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.200]   Ultimately, it makes me more grateful to be alive,
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.120]   it helps me grow, all those kinds of things.
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:10.120]   So I kinda embrace it.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.680]   Otherwise I feel like I will never do anything.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:13.700]   I have to feel shitty,
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.600]   but that's not a thing I prescribe to others.
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:19.760]   There's a famous professor at MIT,
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:22.000]   his name is Marvin Minsky.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.400]   And when he was giving advice to students,
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.560]   he said, "The secret to my success
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:33.560]   "was that I always hated everything I did in the past."
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:36.080]   So always sort of being self-critical
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.080]   about everything you've accomplished.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.880]   Never really take a moment of gratitude.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.640]   And I think for a lot of people that hear that,
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:42.600]   that's not good.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:45.640]   You should take a pause and be grateful.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.360]   But it really worked for him.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.600]   So it's a choice you have to make.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.680]   - Yeah, it reminds me of the quote,
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.480]   "Be happy but never satisfied."
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.600]   Where you can have a positive spin
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.600]   and still want to improve yourself.
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:05.600]   - But yeah, when did you decide
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.220]   to take a step in the spotlight?
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.160]   That terrifying spotlight of the internet?
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.280]   - It was actually my senior year of college,
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:17.840]   and I was really busy with work and school.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.000]   And chess was kind of like this lost love.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.800]   And the interesting thing is that
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.240]   the longer I don't play chess,
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:26.320]   the more I kind of miss playing it casually
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.360]   and enjoy it more.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:30.040]   'Cause then I start looking at it with fresh eyes.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.000]   But I didn't have time to play tournaments.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.720]   So I started streaming online
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:35.920]   because it was more social
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.320]   than just playing strangers on the internet
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.120]   without knowing anything about who they are.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.400]   And I started slowly growing a community
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:47.480]   and got in touch with chess.com pretty quickly too.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:50.120]   So then it was this hobby that I would do once a week,
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.400]   every Thursday at 8 p.m.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:55.880]   And it was one of the things that brought me a lot of joy.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.800]   And actually, speaking of depression,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.120]   did struggle for at least 10 years of my life.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:06.080]   And it was one of those things where chess and streaming
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.840]   was such a distraction and it brought me such great joy
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.200]   that I just kept doing it 'cause I really, really liked it.
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.120]   And then I was working on something that didn't pan out
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.040]   and decided to go and take a risk
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.560]   and just stream full time,
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.560]   which seemed a little bit weird at the moment.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.040]   - Was that terrifying, that leap?
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.240]   - It was terrifying,
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:33.360]   but I had taken so many terrifying leaps in the past.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.600]   And the last two hadn't worked out,
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.480]   but I was like, "Well, I'll get it eventually." (laughs)
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.120]   So somehow having failed before
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.000]   and going through failure and knowing that I'll be okay
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.360]   made me more likely to just try something
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.360]   that was a very, very weird job.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.280]   - Goodbye, camera.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.160]   - I saw it die.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.840]   - Yeah, the camera, we don't need it.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.680]   But one of the cameras died.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.640]   - Luckily, we have another five.
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.480]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:02.040]   - I was like, "This is where, this triggers the spiral.
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.200]   "Alexa's gonna go to the aid ofstead now."
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.360]   - It's still somehow awake.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.440]   - Is there advice you can give
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.920]   about the dark places you've gone in your mind,
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.080]   the depression you suffered from,
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.560]   how to get out from your own story?
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.480]   - Whenever I go to those really dark places,
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.720]   the scariest thing is that it feels like
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.520]   I will never get rid of this feeling,
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.600]   and it is very overwhelming.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:36.680]   And I just have to kind of look back over timespans
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.840]   and remember that every single time I have got through it
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.680]   and remind myself that it is just temporary.
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.040]   And that has been the most helpful thing for me
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.880]   'cause I just try to combat the scariest thing about it.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.600]   - And then believe, have faith that it's gonna,
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.720]   like this will go away.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:57.000]   - And take action, obviously, to make sure it goes away.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.480]   And I've also tried to spin it as depression
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.240]   is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with,
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:03.480]   but also one of the biggest motivators
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.400]   because if I just am left with my own brain,
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.800]   I get very depressed,
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.640]   then I really like working or focusing on things.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.520]   So it actually pushed me to try to focus on school,
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.200]   try to focus on chess, focus on whatever I'm doing.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.000]   And also if I'm feeling really bad,
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.680]   then there's probably something a little bit off,
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:23.320]   and I use it as a signal and try to think of it as,
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.440]   okay, this is just a sign that there's things
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.720]   that could be improved for long-term.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:28.880]   - What about you, Andrea?
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.400]   Have you gone to dark places in your mind?
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.280]   - I'd say I, my family,
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:36.400]   like I see Alex going through this.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.880]   My mom also has very serious depression.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.600]   Luckily, I got the genes where I don't go through
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.640]   that serious level of depression that they do.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.280]   I'd say mine is much more temporarily.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.040]   - So it's more similar to what I was feeling
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:50.880]   when I was feeling shitty about it.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:53.440]   - Exactly, you go through periods, yes, exactly,
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:55.880]   where like, but I know that it's not something
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.320]   that's clinical and that's just a genetic thing
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.600]   or a mental thing,
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.720]   whereas I know it's more serious for like my family members.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.840]   And I did relate a lot with you where you're saying
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.000]   where that really pushes you.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.600]   And I felt that a lot through content
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.320]   where you're just kind of feel hopeless
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.720]   and kind of like an existential crisis
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.240]   where I don't like the content I'm doing.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.480]   And that's what pushes me to like, okay,
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.320]   you have no choice but to try something
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.800]   that now you're gonna be passionate about
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.880]   'cause otherwise you're gonna be stuck
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.920]   in this never-ending cycle.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.400]   So it does, it's short-term,
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.280]   and then it helps me come up with the things
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.120]   that I enjoy the most content-wise.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.960]   And it also long-term taught me
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.480]   just how to have a more balanced life,
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.760]   like doing small things that make me happier
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.520]   on a daily basis to like working out,
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.200]   to eating healthier, which I noticed when I don't do
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.560]   for weeks, I just get a lot more depressed.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:48.720]   - What has playing chess taught you about life?
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.880]   Has it made you better at life in any kind of way?
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.240]   Or has it made you worse?
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.800]   You know, a lot of people kind of romanticize the idea
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.160]   that chess is kind of like life,
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.880]   or life is kind of like chess.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.240]   And becoming better at making decisions on the chessboard
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.120]   is gonna make you better at making decisions in life.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.560]   Is there some truth to that?
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:11.880]   - I always shy away from these comparisons
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.120]   with chess and life.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.680]   'Cause yeah, it has both positives and negatives.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.000]   So one thing it really helps develop from an early age
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.160]   is having an analytical mind,
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.880]   but then you could also get like paralysis of analysis
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.200]   where you've just thought of everything to death
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.520]   and you're moving too slowly
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.320]   when you just have to keep going forward
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.560]   'cause there's not a great path ahead.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:38.560]   So it's more like exercising your brain and staying sharp,
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.360]   and then also applying that to other things.
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.000]   Whereas if instead of playing chess,
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.520]   you're watching TV or something like that,
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:47.200]   you'd probably end up being less sharp.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:50.800]   - Yeah, I used to, in high school, I'd always preach like,
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.960]   "Ah, chess, transfer school life skills."
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.800]   - College essays.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:56.960]   - I would teach, I taught chess for juvenile department,
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.320]   for special education school.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.800]   I'd cite studies in prisons where like,
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.840]   "Oh, playing chess helped them with X,
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.160]   "and for your kids, it helps with teamwork
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.360]   "and thinking over life choices."
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.920]   And now that I'm older, I don't believe in any of that BS.
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:14.920]   But I do think that the process of working really hard
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.640]   at something which takes really long to see results,
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:20.320]   and you have to be really dedicated.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.920]   And like, I remember in high school and in middle school,
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.480]   well, all my friends, they were having fun on the weekends
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.920]   and I have to be there studying to hours of chess a day
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.600]   and knowing one day it'll pay off,
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.600]   but for like two, three years, nothing paid off.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.920]   Kind of learning that type of patience with anything,
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.840]   it's like, you know, like getting a real job.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.280]   I can't say I ever really worked a real job in my life
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.760]   since I went straight into streaming
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.680]   and I got to work for myself,
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:47.640]   but I'd say it's what people go to college for.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.360]   Like, they learn how to live in the real world.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:52.360]   And I'd say that that's what chess taught me as a kid.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:57.000]   - When you're streaming, when you're doing the creative work,
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.280]   do you feel lonely?
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.520]   So a bunch of creators talk about sort of the,
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:03.880]   it's counterintuitive 'cause you're famous now.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:06.320]   You know.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.680]   - Sort of, not quite, but we're very lucky
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.040]   to have each other.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.080]   - So is that the source of the comfort and the,
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:18.040]   like, is there some sense where it's isolating
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.240]   to have these personalities,
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.100]   they have to always be having fun, being wild and so on?
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:25.560]   Or is it actually the opposite?
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.320]   Like, is it a source of comfort to know
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.920]   that there's so many cool people out there
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.320]   that are giving you their love?
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:34.240]   - It started as a source of comfort
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.000]   because it started with a very small community
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.640]   who would be something,
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.260]   it would be around 200 to 300 viewers.
[01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:43.320]   And you know, only like 30 to 40 of them
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.000]   would actually chat actively.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.960]   So you felt like it was a community, not an audience.
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.480]   - So you like knew them personally almost.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.040]   And it was people who were interested in chess
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.200]   and I would really enjoy that.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.140]   And then as, you know, we started growing bigger,
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:59.860]   the audience kind of changed
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.300]   where they're not there for you personally,
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.680]   they're there while you're entertaining.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:08.360]   And it changed for me.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.160]   And I ended up being a lot more self-conscious
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:14.280]   of things online and started even thinking of myself
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.120]   more like a product than a human being when I'm online
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:17.960]   because I had to--
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:18.920]   - Brand.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.880]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.080]   Otherwise you just start taking everything personally
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.440]   that people comment about you
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.320]   and it's based off a very small clip.
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.720]   - I see, so it was almost a kind of a defense mechanism.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.400]   - Exactly.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.760]   And it took time to get enough,
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.620]   'cause even if you have tough skin,
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.240]   eventually it gets to you when you're online
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:37.080]   every single day,
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:40.080]   listening to thousands of people's feedback on you.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:43.760]   - I think the loneliest part of being a creator
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.100]   is going through burnout,
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.680]   which everyone is just bound to happen,
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.200]   which is why I think we're very lucky
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.360]   that we have each other because, right,
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.040]   it's a numbers game and you're viral and trendy at one point
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.000]   and then you have to fall.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.080]   And then there's months where you're just grinding.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:00.920]   - And I just come in 10 minutes,
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.880]   and I'm like, Andrea, we're irrelevant.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.280]   - That's where I'm bad.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.480]   That's really the worst part of being a creator
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:08.840]   and figuring out how to get over that hump.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.720]   But it makes me very grateful that I have my sister
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:12.880]   because I know that I'm not the only person
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.840]   going through it.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.960]   And yeah, I know that most of my creator friends
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.400]   feel very lonely in that process
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.280]   'cause they don't have someone who's their family
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.240]   and their business partner,
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.080]   and they're working by each other side by side.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.920]   - You kind of tie in your self-worth to your job
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:30.480]   and your content, and maybe even more extremely
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.640]   than other jobs because you also are the entire company
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.000]   and the entire product.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.520]   So when things are going well or when things are not,
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.560]   you just need to be careful to not reflect it like,
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.720]   oh, I am doing bad.
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:44.240]   I am bad rather than the trends have now changed.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.160]   There's outside things.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.000]   We're gonna keep going.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.840]   And this is just the normal waves,
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.720]   which is how we think about it now.
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:52.320]   And also just about, are we enjoying this?
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.440]   Is this what we wanna make?
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:56.280]   But we were stuck in the camp for a while
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:00.440]   when we 10Xed our viewership after the pandemic
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.280]   because people were home and playing chess.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.440]   And then of course that dropped by like 70%.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.640]   And then you see that and you're trying your best,
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.360]   and you just kind of have to deal with it and be like,
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.000]   okay, I'm just gonna keep persevering
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.680]   and maybe it'll get better.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.560]   - That's so fascinating.
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.560]   I mean, this is a struggle of sorts in the 21st century.
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:23.360]   Of like how to be an artist, how to be a creator,
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:27.160]   how to be an interesting mind in response to this algorithm.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.440]   I'm telling you, turning off views and likes is really good.
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.880]   - I don't look at Twitch views for that reason.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.680]   And I get obsessed with the numbers too.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.160]   And I know Andrea does, but for me,
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.560]   what I try now is to be more focused in the moment,
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:42.400]   but Andrea somehow can do it even with the views.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.320]   - So you just, you get, you have fun with it.
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.280]   Like, ooh, number one.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.720]   - I'm too much of like a given to the temporary satisfaction.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.040]   Like I like seeing, I like knowing
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.720]   that if something happens right now,
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:55.120]   viewership's gonna boost by a couple hundred
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.120]   and seeing that I'm right, of course.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:46:59.200]   - But what about when the viewers start dropping it?
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.280]   - Well, and I always, like you just have this intuition now.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:04.040]   And, but I think also the reason
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.480]   that it doesn't affect me so much
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.840]   is when we first started our content journey,
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.800]   we were only Twitch streamers and we, our livelihood,
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.280]   were based on Twitch viewers.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.400]   But now like I've learned how to recycle that content
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.800]   into like YouTube and Shorts and other things
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:21.280]   where I know like, okay, if this stream does badly,
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:22.720]   there's so many more things you can do
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.820]   that also just have a much larger output.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:27.800]   So it doesn't get to me as much as it did.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.680]   - Do you ever feel that with your podcasts
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:32.360]   or do you feel like it's been authentic since the start?
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:35.200]   - No, so there's a million things to say there.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.200]   So one is there's a reason I stopped taking a salary at MIT
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:46.120]   and moved to Texas is I wanted my bank account to go to zero
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:48.680]   because I do my best with my back against the wall.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.600]   So one of the comforts I have is I don't care
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.720]   if this podcast is popular or not.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:54.700]   I want it to not be popular.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.200]   So I don't want it to make money.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.080]   - You're failing, Lex.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.800]   - Yeah, I wanna, I mean, I just do best
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.040]   when I'm more desperate.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.400]   That's like one thing to say.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.120]   - Seems like a reoccurring theme
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.600]   with how you build up your greatest work,
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.880]   which is honestly very respectable.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.720]   - Yeah, so--
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.560]   - Don't even tell me.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:14.400]   - I thank you.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.560]   This is like--
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.040]   - I wouldn't recommend.
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:17.880]   - Right.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.720]   Thank you for finding-- - If you're watching,
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:19.540]   just don't try it at home.
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:23.180]   - The silver lining for a not healthy mental state.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:26.600]   But the other thing is I was very conscious,
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.740]   just like with chess and those kinds of things,
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:31.980]   that I love numbers.
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:35.040]   And I would be, if I paid attention,
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.320]   if I tried to be somebody at their best,
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.900]   like Mr. Beast, who really pays attention to numbers,
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.100]   I would just not, I'd become destroyed by it.
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:48.880]   The highs and the lows of it.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:50.700]   And I just don't think I would be creating
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:54.260]   the best work possible.
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:56.540]   But one of the, I mean,
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:00.860]   one of the big benefits of a podcast is listeners.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:02.940]   And there's an intimacy with the voice.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:06.540]   And I think that is much more stable
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.920]   and a deeper and a more meaningful connection than YouTube.
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.140]   YouTube is a fickle mistress.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:18.140]   So it's a weird drug that like, it really wants you--
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:20.060]   - With very addicting feedback loops.
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:23.460]   When you have a video that's number one out of 10,
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.820]   oh my God, the adrenaline you get.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.680]   - And then the thing I really don't like also
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.500]   is the world will introduce you
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:37.000]   as a person that has a video on YouTube
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.080]   with some X number of views.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.340]   Like the world wants you to be addicted to these numbers.
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:45.500]   - Because they associate it with having done a good job.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.260]   'Cause that's what people think views are,
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.140]   even if it's not.
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:50.420]   - Right, and primarily because they don't have
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:53.700]   any other signal of what's a good job.
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:56.180]   I think the much better signal is people
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:59.040]   that are close to you, your family, your colleagues,
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.060]   that say, wow, that was cool.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.820]   I listened to that, that was really,
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:03.740]   I didn't know this, this was really powerful,
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.760]   this is really moving and so on.
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.020]   But definitely I'm terrified of numbers
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.660]   'cause I feel like, just like I said,
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:15.660]   I'd rather be a Stanley Kubrick.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:20.340]   You'd rather create great art,
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:22.580]   not to be pretentious,
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:24.740]   but the best possible thing you can create.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:26.040]   Whatever the beauty that's,
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.460]   the capacity for creating beauty that's in you,
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:29.740]   I would like to maximize that.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.400]   And I feel like for some people like Mr. Beast,
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.140]   I think those are perfectly aligned.
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:37.660]   'Cause he just loves the most epic thing possible.
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:38.660]   But not for everybody.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.820]   I think there's a lot of people
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:42.340]   for whom that's not perfectly aligned.
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.780]   And so I'm definitely one of those.
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:46.260]   And I'm still really confused
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:48.060]   why anybody listens to this anyway.
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:53.060]   But that's also something I guess you're trying to find,
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:54.240]   you're trying to figure out.
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:58.140]   - I get very afraid of ever becoming someone
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:00.060]   who just makes junk food content
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:03.600]   where you can't stop while you're in the moment
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.340]   and it has all of your attention,
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:06.660]   but when you're done,
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:09.740]   it didn't really bring any value to your life,
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:11.940]   which is something that I think the algorithm
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:14.220]   still does really reward.
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:16.760]   And making sure that as we are learning
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:18.140]   how to create better content,
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:21.300]   it's still something that is gonna be meaningful long-term.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:25.100]   - Well, ultimately, you inspire a lot of young people.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.940]   - Yeah, those are the best.
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:30.140]   When I get messages from people who are like,
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:33.140]   I played you a year ago and my rating was 1400
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:34.180]   and now I'm 1900.
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:35.460]   I'd like to challenge you again
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:38.100]   and it's a 14 year old writing a former email.
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.740]   Those things are always very, very fun to get.
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:42.260]   - And even just outside of chess,
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.860]   it's just empowering to see,
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.340]   and like for young women too,
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:46.740]   to see that kind of thing.
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:50.080]   I mean, you guys are being yourself
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.860]   and making money for being yourself
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:54.860]   and having fun and like growing as human beings,
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:57.680]   which I think is really inspiring for people to see.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.300]   So in that sense, it's really rewarding.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.780]   And then like the way I think about it is
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:06.420]   there is some benefit of doing entertaining type of stuff
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.020]   so that you get the,
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:13.320]   kind of like Mr. Beast does with philanthropy, right?
[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.060]   The bigger Mr. Beast becomes,
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:16.220]   the more effective he is
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:18.380]   at actually doing positive impact on the world.
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:22.320]   So those things are tied together.
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:25.000]   But of course, with podcasts,
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.140]   you guys, well, maybe you have these kinds of tense things,
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:31.960]   but what kind of ideas, what kind of people do platform?
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.460]   What kind of person,
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:38.140]   what kind of human being do you wanna be?
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:42.140]   Because you actually are becoming a person
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:47.140]   and a set of ideas in front of the public eye.
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:49.460]   And you have to ask yourself that question really hard,
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.900]   like really seriously,
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:54.540]   because if you're doing stuff in private,
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:57.260]   you have the complete luxury to try shit out.
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.260]   - Right.
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:01.260]   - I think you have less of a luxury to try shit out
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.040]   because the internet can be vicious
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.640]   in punishing you for trying shit out.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.640]   - And do you think that's sometimes a bad thing
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.040]   where you have less freedom to make mistakes?
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:12.840]   - Yeah, you have two choices.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:15.360]   So one, you put up a wall and say,
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.720]   I don't give a shit what people think.
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.560]   I don't like doing that
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.200]   'cause I like being fragile to the world
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:23.320]   and keeping my, sort of wearing my heart on my sleeve.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:26.080]   Or the other one, yeah, you have to be,
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:30.560]   you have to actually think through what you're gonna say.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:33.760]   You have to think of like, what do I believe?
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.640]   You have to be more serious about what you put out there.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.320]   It's annoying, but it's also actually,
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:43.600]   you should have always been doing that.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:46.500]   You should be deliberate with your actions and your words.
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:50.560]   But I don't know, it's a,
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.000]   but some of it, it's such a balance
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.720]   because some of my favorite people are brilliant people
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:00.280]   that allow themselves to act ridiculous
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:01.240]   and be silly.
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:03.760]   Elon Musk, who's become a good friend,
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.400]   is the silliest human of all.
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.640]   I mean, he's incredibly brilliant and productive and so on,
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:11.780]   but allows themselves to be silly.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:13.600]   And that's also inspiring to people.
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.440]   Like you don't have to be perfect.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:18.240]   You don't have to, you can be a weird,
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.880]   a giant weird mess and it's okay.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.560]   So it's a balance.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.000]   I think when you start to delve into political topics,
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.200]   into topics that really get tense for people,
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:29.720]   then you have to be a little bit more careful
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:31.320]   and deliberate.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.360]   But it's also wise to stay the hell away
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.440]   from those topics in general.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.840]   Like I mentioned to you offline,
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.880]   somebody I have been debating whether I want to talk to
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:42.080]   or not is Karyakin on the chess board
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.160]   because chess is just a game,
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.480]   but throughout the history of the 20th century,
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.720]   it was played between the Russians and the Americans
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:56.380]   and so on where they were at war, cold or hot war.
[01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:58.280]   And those are interesting.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.520]   Those are interesting conversations to be had
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.280]   at the Olympics and so on.
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:05.840]   It's not just a game in some sense.
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.120]   It's like a mini war.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:11.280]   And so I have to decide whether I want to talk to him
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.120]   or not and those kinds of things.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.440]   You have to make those kinds of decisions.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.120]   For now, you guys are not playing chess
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:18.920]   with Donald Trump or Obama or so on.
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:20.920]   - We are not right now, no.
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.200]   - How long is a stream?
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:23.280]   Like a few hours, right?
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.880]   - Now they're two to three hours.
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.080]   When I was first streaming,
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.520]   I'd stream for like six hours a day.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:29.360]   - A day.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.480]   - At least usually.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.320]   Yeah, for like six to seven days a week.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.880]   - Are you doing just like a talking one?
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:38.320]   - No, I would be playing chess the entire time while talking.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:41.340]   And when I started streaming,
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:44.480]   that's kind of how everybody blows up on Twitch.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.400]   You're just putting in crazy hours and you're always there.
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:49.240]   It's not about making the best content.
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:51.880]   It's about letting people feel like
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:53.440]   they're hanging out with you
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.840]   and just being on as much as you can.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:58.120]   But I ended up feeling very burnt out
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.400]   'cause it's hard to be your best self
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:02.400]   when you're in front of a camera for that long
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:06.580]   because you do get scared of going into places
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:09.440]   where you wanna learn but you might not be the best in
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.920]   'cause it's harder to learn in public
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.360]   than do something that like, yeah,
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.840]   we're better than 99% of our viewers at chess.
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.440]   So that's a lot less scary
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:19.080]   than trying to play a game that you're bad at
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.240]   or discuss topics that you're interested in.
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:26.740]   - Yeah, have the beginner's mind and be dumb at something.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:27.580]   - Right.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:28.900]   - Yeah, which is where the fun is
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:30.100]   and you get to learn together
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:32.340]   but people punish you for it on the internet.
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:35.980]   What about you, Andrea?
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:38.340]   - Yeah, I think like Alex said at the beginning
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.780]   when we were grinding a lot,
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:43.100]   you don't really even have time for much of a private life
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:45.540]   'cause you're streaming every hour of your life
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:49.180]   and people want it, like the appeal of streamers,
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.580]   it's called like being parasocial
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:52.060]   where you feel like they're your friend
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:54.580]   and they like it 'cause they want you
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:57.100]   to share everything about your life.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:59.860]   Really the main challenge for me at first
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:03.780]   when trying to prioritize quantity over quality,
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:05.420]   which we're not doing anymore,
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:08.540]   was realizing that I can't turn everything I'm interested in
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:10.740]   and every passion into content.
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:14.080]   Before I'm like, well, I must stream more
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.900]   but I like music and I like playing piano
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:20.220]   and I like reading into these topics and I like fitness
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:21.940]   and then I'd try to live stream all of it
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:24.660]   and that's just, at some point it's like
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:27.500]   just enjoy your time off for those hobbies
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:28.940]   and prioritize what you're good at
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:32.700]   'cause that's just gonna be better for the channel overall.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.340]   So that was a learning lesson for sure.
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:36.500]   It's nice 'cause there are some intersections
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.940]   when I have tried new things that I really enjoy
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:41.760]   and it pays off but that's more less often.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.500]   - So it's more like you can be yourself
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:46.700]   but only specific parts of yourself online
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:50.780]   and the rest, sometimes it's nice to just keep private
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:55.780]   and feel that you could just give it your 100% freedom.
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:58:01.860]   - See, I feel like I try to be the exact same person
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:04.000]   on podcasts as in private life.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.860]   I really don't like hiding anything.
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:08.620]   - But you're also a generalist, right?
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:10.300]   Where you have people with all topics.
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:13.580]   For us, we built our audience off of very specific things.
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:15.120]   So people sometimes feel like,
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.020]   even at the start when we started playing less chess,
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:18.940]   they're like, I subbed for chess.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:20.980]   Why are you not playing chess?
[01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:22.460]   - Exactly, people are tuning in
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:25.020]   for an interesting conversation on a bunch of topics.
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.980]   So like the more you are yourself, the better it is.
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:29.060]   But it is very hard when you build your brand
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:31.900]   on like one type of gaming content.
[01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:32.860]   - Build your brand.
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:36.460]   But yeah, the way you become a journalist
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:38.940]   is you slowly expand.
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:42.960]   It's like expanded checkers.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:47.540]   I guess that's the downward--
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:48.580]   - Maybe poker.
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:50.020]   - Poker, yeah, exactly, poker.
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:52.940]   But also just the ideas, the space of ideas.
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:54.300]   And one of the cool things about chess
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.500]   is when you're talking over the chess board,
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.900]   it's a kind of podcast.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:02.700]   - That is actually an idea we've had with playing chess
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:05.380]   while also doing a podcast and talking with people.
[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.700]   It's kind of like an icebreaker
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.940]   where you're also focusing on the game at the same time.
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:12.480]   But we are slowly evolving and we're doing more things.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:14.020]   Like one thing we wanted to do
[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:16.260]   is spend less time in front of the computer.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:18.140]   So now we're doing a chess travel show
[01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:19.460]   where we go to different countries
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:20.860]   and look at the chess culture.
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:23.100]   So it actually feels like we're doing things
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.980]   that we would wanna do and explore anyway.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:28.540]   And maybe it's not as much in the idea space,
[01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:31.580]   which we both enjoy and do a lot in our own free time,
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:34.780]   but in the sharing cool experiences with our audience
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:35.980]   that we actually wanna do.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.620]   - Where do you look forward to going?
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:41.300]   - We're going to Romania on September 9th.
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:44.340]   And I think this is the most exciting for me
[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:46.940]   because we're going back to the country
[01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:48.900]   where our entire family's from,
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.340]   where our grandmother taught our dad,
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.980]   who taught us how to play chess.
[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:54.980]   It has a very strong chess culture.
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:57.620]   So it'll be very unique to go back
[01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:59.700]   and see how everything is
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:01.660]   when we haven't been back for a very long time.
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.700]   - And for Romanians, it's very rare
[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:07.900]   when there's a famous Romanian who accomplishes something,
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.620]   which is why right now Andrew Tate's
[02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:10.820]   the most famous Romanian.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:11.660]   - But he's banned, so we're at this spot.
[02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:13.660]   - For a bad reason, exactly.
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:15.420]   And there's something very special
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:17.420]   about Romanian pride.
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:19.660]   And when we meet fellow Romanians in the US,
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:22.140]   like it's just an amazing connection.
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:24.020]   And like, I hear the way my dad talked about,
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:26.580]   like, for example, Nadia,
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:28.620]   who was a famous Romanian gymnast.
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:30.100]   And he's like, "Yeah, like Romania,
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:31.220]   we sucked at everything.
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:34.620]   But when she won the Olympics for gymnast,
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:36.460]   every kid on the street was doing gymnastics."
[02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:37.660]   'Cause it's very rare
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:39.500]   that they make it to that level of success.
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.940]   And I was saying that we're super successful, super famous,
[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:44.180]   but it is really cool to meet other Romanians through chess
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.940]   'cause it's a very special bond.
[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:50.420]   - Yeah, you feel like it's a community and like you belong.
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:53.340]   - Yeah, you can't get that anywhere else.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:55.580]   - Let me ask your opinion since you mentioned him,
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:56.700]   Andrew Tate.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:00:59.700]   You're both women, successful women.
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:01.220]   You're both creators.
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:03.740]   So Andrew Tate is an example of somebody
[02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:06.180]   that has become exceptionally successful
[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:10.340]   at galvanizing public attention.
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:13.620]   But he's also, from many perspective, a misogynist.
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:16.740]   So let me ask a personal question.
[02:01:16.740 --> 02:01:19.180]   Do you think I should talk to him on this podcast?
[02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:22.580]   How would you feel as a fan,
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:28.580]   somebody, I'm talking to the great Alex and Andrea Botez,
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:32.220]   and the next episode is with Andrew Tate.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:34.540]   - I think it's a double-edged sword.
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:37.840]   And most of these things are not as black and white
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.880]   as they seem.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.340]   'Cause on one hand, I don't agree with his beliefs.
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:45.940]   And I think he's said a lot of things that are very hurtful
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:49.480]   and that influence people's opinions.
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:54.860]   At the same time, talking to someone through that
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:57.140]   and trying to get to the root of it
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:02:01.060]   and how much of it he used just as a social media tactic
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:03.620]   to maybe change the opinion of people
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.500]   who have been so influenced by him
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:08.420]   towards something that is maybe more understanding
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:12.500]   towards women or things like that could do some good.
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.220]   But at the same time, platforming someone like that
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:18.260]   and giving them more attention also signals to other people
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:20.100]   who have a platform that it's okay.
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:22.580]   So it's kind of weighing the pluses and the minuses.
[02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:26.020]   And it's a very tough decision 'cause it's not clear.
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:28.300]   - And the thing about the internet,
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:30.500]   you make the wrong decision, you're gonna pay for it.
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:31.320]   - Right.
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:33.420]   That's the thing.
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:36.260]   Like personally, and it is funny,
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:38.000]   like I think the whole way he rose to fame
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.100]   is just a growth hack.
[02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:41.500]   And I've seen other people do it where like you just say
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:44.220]   kind of, I don't, honestly,
[02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:45.700]   I don't really listen to his content
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:47.020]   'cause I just find it so dumb.
[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:49.660]   But I think he knows that by saying the dumbest,
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:52.860]   most controversial things, that's like a quick rise to fame.
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:56.500]   And I think surface level, like he can really hold it up,
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.660]   but that's why I would honestly enjoy tuning
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:00.820]   into a conversation where you're really breaking down
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:02.220]   to the core of those beliefs.
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:04.700]   And I think like the young kids who look up to him
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:06.940]   and when you actually hear someone challenging it
[02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:09.140]   could actually be helpful for people.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:12.340]   But at the same time, it's a lot of bad publicity.
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:15.020]   People see your podcast, they see, wow, like they don't,
[02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:16.620]   if they don't know you and they don't know
[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:18.340]   why you're interviewing him and they don't listen,
[02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:20.540]   they'll see that and then 100% think
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:22.360]   it's for the other reason.
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:24.260]   - But I'm also afraid of a society
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:27.180]   where you can't have discourse with people you don't,
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:29.020]   with people you disagree with.
[02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:31.140]   And even though I don't like Andrew Tate,
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:33.860]   I think the fact that he got banned from all the platforms
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:36.900]   is kind of scary because it sets a precedent.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:38.200]   And you always have to ask yourself,
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.660]   would this be ethical if I was on the other side?
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.640]   And even things with a president like Trump,
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:45.740]   even if let's say you're somebody who was on the left,
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.660]   if that would have happened to a leftist president,
[02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:48.500]   how would you feel?
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:49.880]   Would you think that's morally ethical?
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:54.100]   So that is something that I think is important.
[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:56.420]   We try to find ways to have conversations
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:59.140]   and reach some mutual understanding
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:02.140]   and try instead of just amplifying the worst
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.560]   about every human being.
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:07.580]   - Well, so one of the major reasons I'm struggling with
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:11.560]   is because I really enjoy talking to brilliant women.
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:14.880]   I think it's also, a lot of women reached out to me
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:17.900]   saying like, it is what it is,
[02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:20.060]   but they're inspired when a female guest is on.
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:23.240]   And to me, if I talk to somebody like Andrew Tate,
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.440]   even if I have a really hard hitting,
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.320]   I think it could be a very good conversation
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:34.480]   that lessens the likelihood that a brilliant,
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.560]   powerful female will go on the show.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:39.820]   Because they'll never watch it,
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:41.540]   but the thing we do in this society
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:42.700]   is we put labels on each other.
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:46.740]   Well, Lex is the person that platforms misogynists.
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:53.120]   I did a thing where Joe Rogan got in trouble
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:56.780]   over an N-word controversy earlier in the year.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.780]   And Joe's a good friend of mine.
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:00.500]   I said that I stand with Joe,
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.900]   that he's not a racist or something like that.
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:06.460]   And within certain communities,
[02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:09.840]   I'm now somebody who's an apologist for racists, right?
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.360]   Or a racist myself, that kind of thing.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:14.620]   And we put labels without ever listening to the content,
[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:17.660]   without ever sort of, actually,
[02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:19.540]   just even the very simple step,
[02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:21.680]   or it seems to be difficult, of like,
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:27.200]   taking on the best possible interpretation
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:28.560]   of what a person said,
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.440]   and giving them the benefit of the doubt
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.880]   and having empathy for another person.
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:34.320]   So you have to play in this field
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.680]   where people assign labels to each other,
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.360]   and it's difficult.
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:41.260]   But ultimately, I believe, I hope,
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:45.000]   that good conversations is a way,
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.760]   like a greater understanding of what people
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:50.000]   to grow together as a society,
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.440]   and improve and learn the lessons,
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:52.420]   the mistakes of the past.
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:54.440]   But you also have to play this game
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:56.800]   where people just like putting labels on each other
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:58.520]   and canceling each other over those.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.560]   Or that guy said one thing nice about Donald Trump,
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:04.840]   he must be a far right Nazi,
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:06.260]   or the opposite,
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:11.000]   that this person said something nice about the vaccine,
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.760]   he must be a far left whatever,
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:18.760]   'cause apologist for whatever, for Fauci.
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:23.200]   Where most of us, I think, are ultimately in the middle.
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.500]   It's a weird thing.
[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:28.080]   But I think, and it's also painful on a personal level.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:31.960]   Like people have written to me
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:35.080]   about things like single words,
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.640]   half sentences that I've said about
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:39.900]   either Putin or Zelensky,
[02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:42.640]   where they have hate towards me because of what I said.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:45.240]   Both directions.
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:48.600]   I've now accumulated very passionate people
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:52.120]   that some call me a Putin apologist,
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:54.440]   some call me a Zelensky apologist.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:58.720]   And it hurts to, given how much I have family there,
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:00.920]   how much I've seen of suffering there,
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.640]   and to carry that burden over time
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:04.560]   and not let it destroy you is tough.
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:07.940]   So like, do you wanna take on another thing like that
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:09.520]   when you have conversations?
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:10.360]   - Right.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:13.120]   - Or can I just talk to awesome people like you two?
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:14.200]   Where it's not that burden.
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:16.120]   - We're not controversial.
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:17.680]   - Or you're interesting, you're fascinating,
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:21.000]   you're inspiring, you're like fun, you know?
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.400]   Not all those difficult things
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:25.720]   are gonna come with more difficult conversations.
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:27.760]   - Right, but somebody has to be
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:30.160]   making those difficult decisions
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:35.160]   and challenging the notions that we should cancel someone
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.640]   just for slightly disagreeing with us.
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:40.640]   And it's very hard to take that on personally.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.280]   And I think that's a huge part of it.
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.280]   When you know it's something you're doing
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.400]   for the right reasons,
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:46.800]   and you're getting a lot of people
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:50.340]   coming and misinterpreting it, it's very painful.
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:56.400]   But I think you have to ask yourself long-term
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:57.920]   if when you made that decision,
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:00.600]   you ultimately thought it would be better or worse
[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:02.800]   for your listeners to know that conversation.
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:05.880]   And then if you can sleep with it at night, take the risk.
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:08.640]   - Yeah, when actually when I talk to people that,
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:10.000]   especially like astrophysicists,
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.760]   and you realize how tiny we are.
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:12.600]   - Right.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.680]   - How incredible, like how huge the universe is.
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:16.960]   Like, it doesn't matter, you can do anything.
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:20.880]   You could like, you can walk around naked,
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.320]   talk shit to people, do whatever the hell.
[02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:25.600]   And actually in modern social media,
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:27.000]   people just like forget.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.160]   It's like, it's ultimately liberating.
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:32.520]   Just try to do, at least from my perspective,
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.720]   the best possible thing for the world you can.
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:37.280]   Take big risks, and it doesn't matter.
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:39.620]   - And that's the other thing with being canceled nowadays,
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:43.400]   because everyone's attention is much more short-sighted.
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:44.440]   You can get canceled,
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:46.160]   and then it'll blow over in three days.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:48.440]   And you actually see things like this on Twitch very often,
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:51.240]   where people just have bursts of outrage,
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.360]   and they come into your chat,
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:54.080]   and they're all spamming and saying mean things,
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:55.680]   and then three days after.
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:57.960]   And of course, they're not actually ever serious things.
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:00.080]   They're usually like things clipped of any streamers
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:01.200]   in like their worst moments,
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.860]   but then people forget about it pretty soon after.
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:06.960]   - So you're able to accept that,
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:09.900]   like when somebody's being shitty to you for a day?
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:12.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I still get sometimes emotional about it,
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.200]   especially when I'm like, oh wow,
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.760]   like these things that are being said are not true,
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:19.280]   or like this is clearly taken out of context,
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.440]   but I've just accepted that it's part of the job.
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.080]   And if I am trying my best,
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:29.240]   and I am trying things with as good intentions as possible,
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:31.080]   then I just try to learn every time that happens,
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:32.840]   and be like, okay, what could I do better?
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:34.780]   And what is just part of the job?
[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:37.160]   - Well, let's start some controversy.
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:39.400]   Who's the greatest chess player of all time?
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:42.320]   Is it Magnus Carlsen?
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.280]   Is it Garry Kasparov?
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:45.360]   Is it somebody else, Bobby Fischer?
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.280]   Do you have a favorite, Alex?
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.760]   - So whenever I hear this question,
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:53.720]   I interpret it in a very specific way,
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:57.320]   where it's not who was the most talented chess player,
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:59.240]   or who had the most impact on the chess world,
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:02.860]   but who is the greatest at playing chess?
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.400]   Where if you were putting all of these players
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.960]   at their peak, who would be the best?
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.460]   And we're kind of living in a world
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:14.120]   where obviously humans are becoming more like cyborgs,
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.320]   and their tools make them a lot more powerful.
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.480]   - Yes.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:22.000]   - And the computer is the most powerful tool for chess
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.480]   that we've ever witnessed.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:26.540]   And the top players now, someone like Magnus Carlsen,
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:30.080]   or Garry Kasparov, if they were gonna go towards people
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:35.080]   like even Lasker, or Bobby Fischer back in the day,
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:38.060]   Lasker, he was world champion for 27 years,
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.080]   he was the best in his field by far,
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.640]   but would he be able to stand up to someone
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:44.240]   like Magnus Carlsen who has had these tools?
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:45.600]   I don't think so.
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:49.680]   So most chess players have said Garry Kasparov,
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:52.480]   and I think even Magnus has said that in the past,
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:55.320]   but I like to think of it as Magnus in his peak,
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:57.600]   and Garry at his peak, and because Magnus was able
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:59.400]   to live more in a computer era,
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.560]   I feel like so far he's the greatest of all time.
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:04.000]   And some studies say things like
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.760]   how there's rating inflation,
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:06.980]   but I looked into some of them,
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:11.400]   and they basically calculated people's play
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.800]   over the years, and it seems that there hasn't
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.360]   been inflation, people are just getting better,
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:18.320]   and I think it's 'cause you have better tools at chess.
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.960]   - And also one of the cases, what's your--
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:24.560]   - I was gonna say, I actually, I disagree with that.
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:26.480]   - Good, make it interesting.
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:31.480]   - I think I would judge the greatest player of all time
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:33.680]   in relative to the time that they lived in,
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:36.680]   and Magnus, although he is technically
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:38.440]   the strongest chess player in history,
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.960]   that is because he had computers to study chess with,
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:45.640]   and of course, if you compare him to Garry Kasparov,
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.840]   he plays most like Stockfish,
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.640]   but Garry Kasparov, at his time,
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:53.680]   he beat more players of his skill level than Magnus did,
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:55.320]   and Magnus loses more often.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.660]   He also, of course, held the belt for 20 years more,
[02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:01.120]   so I'd say actually, because Garry lacked the help
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:03.480]   of computers to study chess,
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:06.580]   and overall performed better against players
[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:09.280]   of his skill level, I think he would be number one.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:11.880]   - Nice, yeah, but I mean, the case that people make
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:16.360]   for Magnus, and many, I mean, what Alex said,
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:21.080]   but also, Magnus plays a lot, and he doesn't,
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:24.960]   he plays a lot of blitz, bullet, and he puts,
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.520]   he gets drunk, and he's really putting himself out there,
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:31.480]   and in all kinds of conditions,
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:33.640]   and he's able to dominate in a lot of them.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:36.280]   We get to see many of the losses, or blunders,
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.120]   and all that kind of stuff,
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.000]   because he just puts himself out there,
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.520]   and I think Kasparov was much more like--
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:44.160]   - Never saw him play drunk, right?
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:47.080]   - Yeah, and it's very focused on the World Championship,
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.120]   it's very, like, very limited number of games,
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:55.080]   and very focused on winning, and so there's some aspect
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.160]   to the versatility, the aggressive play, the fun,
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:01.800]   all of that, that I think you have to give credit to.
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:02.800]   - Oh, 100%.
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:07.800]   - In terms of just the scope, the scale of the variety
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:10.760]   of genius exhibited by Magnus.
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:12.280]   - And he might not even be done yet,
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.680]   I don't know if he'll ever hit 2,900,
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:17.580]   but we can't judge yet, 'cause he's not at the peak
[02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:18.960]   of his career, potentially.
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:20.900]   - What do you think about him not playing World Championship?
[02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:23.080]   Isn't that wild?
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:26.800]   The entirety of the history of chess in the 20th century,
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:27.840]   going like, "Meh."
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:31.720]   It's walking away from this one tournament
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:34.320]   that seems to be at the center of chess.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:37.400]   What do you think about that decision?
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.440]   - I mean, you can't help but be disappointed,
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:43.040]   as a chess fan who wants to see the best player
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:46.760]   in the world defend his title, but I also understand it
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:51.360]   on a personal level, and not feeling as satisfied
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:53.800]   when you're going to the World Championship
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:55.720]   and having to defend against people
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.360]   who are less strong than you.
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.540]   And also, imagine winning World Championships
[02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:02.040]   and not feeling a joy out of that.
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:02.880]   - Yeah.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:05.640]   - So maybe by not doing that and focusing instead
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:09.160]   on a goal like 2,900, he'll be more likely to accomplish it,
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:12.480]   because he's focusing on what actually motivates him
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:17.480]   to play chess, but I do think that it will hurt
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.440]   how we judge the next World Champion.
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:23.880]   - I think it won't change him being the best player
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:27.320]   in the world, and for someone to replace him,
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:29.900]   even let's say like Nepo versus Ding,
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:32.900]   even if one of them win, and right, on some stance,
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:35.260]   it does lower the merit, because now,
[02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:37.700]   who has the World Chess Championship title
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:39.620]   isn't actually the best player in the world,
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:41.700]   and that has happened before in the past,
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:45.460]   but still gonna take 'em the same effort to prove
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:48.100]   when they would pass him, like 10, 20 years,
[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.460]   to become stronger than Magnus,
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:51.220]   so I don't think it changes the skill level
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:54.180]   that it takes to become the best chess player in the world.
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:56.740]   I think for chess fans, it's very disappointing,
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:14:58.700]   but I think in the overall grand scheme
[02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:01.660]   of the public view to people who don't really,
[02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:04.700]   so what breaks the popular culture,
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:08.300]   and you think of what names people know
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:10.620]   who don't play chess, like Bobby Fischer did it,
[02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:12.320]   most people know Kasparov or Magnus,
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:14.420]   it takes the same ability and talent,
[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:15.480]   and that doesn't change.
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:16.980]   - I think it does change, though,
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:20.360]   if you're playing a player who's not as strong,
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.820]   but I see your point as well, and I know we differ on this.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:25.220]   Like I said, I heard you ask Magnus,
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:26.720]   but what is your take on it?
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:33.940]   - Well, listen, his answer is kind of brilliant,
[02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:38.940]   which he's not saying he's bored of the World Championship,
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:41.660]   he's bored of a process
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.660]   that doesn't determine the best player.
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:47.100]   Like, and it's too anxiety-inducing to him
[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:49.760]   to have a small number of games.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:54.780]   He doesn't mind losing, which is really fascinating,
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:58.620]   to a better player, or somebody who's his level.
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:02.060]   He's more anxious about losing to--
[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:04.220]   - A weaker player.
[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:07.180]   - The weaker player because of the small sample size.
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:09.840]   Now, if poker players had that anxiety,
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:11.620]   they would never play at all, right?
[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:13.340]   That's the World Series of Poker.
[02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:17.580]   You get to lose against weaker players all the time,
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:19.420]   that's the throw all the dice,
[02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:21.980]   but that's an interesting perspective
[02:16:21.980 --> 02:16:25.140]   that he would love to play 20, 30, 40 games
[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:26.140]   in the World Championship,
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:28.180]   but then he would enjoy it much more.
[02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:29.980]   And also play shorter games
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.620]   because they emphasize the pure chess,
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:35.880]   actually being able to,
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:41.220]   much more variety in the middle game,
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:42.760]   just to see a bunch of chaos
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:44.460]   and see how you're able to compute, calculate,
[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:46.500]   and intuition, all that kind of stuff.
[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:48.180]   I mean, that's beautiful.
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:50.740]   I wish the chess world would step up
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:53.360]   and meet him in a place that makes sense.
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:56.540]   Change the World Championship,
[02:16:56.540 --> 02:17:00.460]   so FIDE changing it somehow that allows for that,
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:03.620]   or having other really respected tournaments
[02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:05.300]   that become like an annual thing,
[02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:06.480]   that step up to that.
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:12.120]   Or more kind of online YouTube type of competitions,
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:14.580]   which I think they're trying to do more and more,
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:16.420]   like the Crypto Cup and all those kinds of things.
[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:17.860]   - Yeah, and the Grand Tour.
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:18.700]   - The Grand Tour.
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:19.520]   - Where players play in,
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:21.100]   which takes a lot of the top players
[02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:23.740]   and they do it online in shorter formats.
[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:25.060]   - But there's, you know,
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:26.260]   so that's his perspective.
[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:30.320]   My perhaps narrow perspective
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.340]   is I romanticize the Olympic Games,
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:33.660]   and those are every four years,
[02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:36.300]   and the World Championships,
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:38.220]   because they're rare,
[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:40.420]   because the sample size is so small.
[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:42.180]   That's where the magic happens.
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:45.100]   Everything's on the line for, you know,
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:47.920]   for people that spend their whole life,
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:50.580]   20 years of dedication,
[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:51.600]   everything you have,
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:54.740]   every minute of the day is spent for that moment.
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:56.300]   You know, you think about like gymnastics
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:57.580]   at the Olympic Games.
[02:17:57.580 --> 02:17:59.780]   There's certain sports where a single mistake
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:01.300]   and you're fucked.
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:03.940]   And that stress, that pressure,
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:08.940]   it can break people,
[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:11.180]   or it can create magic.
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:13.580]   Like a person that's the underdog
[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:15.540]   has the best night of their life,
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:18.220]   or the person that's been dominating for years,
[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:19.860]   all of a sudden slips up.
[02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:22.080]   That drama from a human perspective is beautiful.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:24.560]   So I still like the World Championships,
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:28.320]   but then again, looking at all the draws,
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:33.320]   looking at like, well, the magic isn't quite there.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.440]   So to me, when I see faster games of chess,
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:39.360]   that's much more beautiful.
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:41.520]   But I don't understand the game of chess
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:43.200]   deeply enough to know,
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:48.220]   like, does it have to be so many draws?
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:51.420]   Like, is there a way to create a more dynamic chess?
[02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:53.820]   And he talked about random chess
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:55.380]   with a random starting position.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:56.220]   That's really interesting.
[02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:58.460]   But then of course, that's like,
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:19:00.540]   then you do have to play hundreds of games
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:01.820]   and that kind of stuff.
[02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:03.300]   - Right.
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:07.300]   - But I think it's great that the world number one
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:12.420]   is struggling with these questions
[02:19:12.420 --> 02:19:13.800]   because he's in the position,
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:16.800]   he has the leverage to actually change the game of chess
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:19.480]   as it's publicly seen, as it's publicly played.
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.920]   So it's interesting.
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:24.120]   He's still young enough to dominate
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:26.280]   for quite a long time if he wants.
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:27.120]   So I don't know.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:32.120]   I, with Kasparov, the fight between nations,
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:34.760]   I hope they have the World Championship
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:38.520]   and I hope he's still a part of it somehow.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:40.400]   I hope he changes his mind.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:41.240]   - And comes back.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:44.640]   - Comes back, some kind of dramatic thing, I don't know.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:47.860]   But it is, his heart is not in it.
[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:48.700]   And then,
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:54.460]   and then that's not beautiful to see, right?
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:20:01.980]   Yeah, it is beautiful that the thing he wants
[02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:04.420]   is a great game of chess against an opponent
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:06.120]   that's his level or better.
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:10.060]   And that's great that he's coming from that place.
[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:11.840]   But I hope he comes back somehow
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:13.340]   'cause the World Championship
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:16.900]   is a special thing in any sport.
[02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:18.500]   - So you do wish that the person
[02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:19.980]   who wins the World Championship
[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:21.700]   is the best player in the world?
[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:24.660]   - No.
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:28.580]   I hope that the best people in the world,
[02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:31.660]   the two best people in the world are the ones that sit down.
[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:35.780]   But the person that wins is the person that,
[02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:37.140]   that's the magic of it.
[02:20:37.140 --> 02:20:39.100]   Nobody knows who's going to win.
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:41.460]   I think Magnus is so,
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:43.880]   he really wants the best person to win.
[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:48.460]   That's why he wants the large sample size.
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:50.420]   But to me, there's some magic to it.
[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:53.340]   The stress of it, the drama of it,
[02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:55.260]   that's all part of the game.
[02:20:55.260 --> 02:20:58.060]   Like it's not just about the purity of the game,
[02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:01.740]   like the calculation, the pure chess of it.
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:03.120]   It's also like the drama.
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:07.740]   Yeah, the pressure, the drama, all of it.
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:10.740]   The shit talking, if it gets to you, the mind games.
[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:12.540]   - This is the part that's fun to watch,
[02:21:12.540 --> 02:21:14.460]   but less fun to be playing.
[02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:15.700]   - But that's why it's great.
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:18.620]   Who can rise under that pressure
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:20.320]   and who melts under that pressure.
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:24.140]   There's a lot of people that look up to you,
[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:26.180]   like they're inspired by you
[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:28.700]   'cause you've taken a kind of nonlinear path through life.
[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:30.980]   Is there any advice you have for people
[02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:32.340]   like in high school today
[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:35.740]   that are trying to figure out what they want to do?
[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:36.980]   Do they want to go to Stanford?
[02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:41.380]   Do they want to pursue a career in, I don't know,
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:45.980]   in industry or go kind of the path you guys have taken,
[02:21:45.980 --> 02:21:48.460]   which is have the ability to do all of that
[02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:50.620]   and still choose to make the thing
[02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:52.660]   that you're passionate about your life?
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:56.740]   - I always like the calculated risks approach
[02:21:56.740 --> 02:22:00.340]   where when you're younger, it's okay to take more risks
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:02.300]   'cause you have a lot more time,
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:04.000]   but there has to be a reason
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.060]   why you're doing that particular risk.
[02:22:06.060 --> 02:22:08.340]   Is it something that you've spent a lot of time already
[02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:09.860]   really passionate and working on
[02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:11.300]   or is it just something that's trendy
[02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:12.140]   and you want to do it
[02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:13.780]   'cause you don't have a better option?
[02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:16.300]   And that's actually similar to what Andrea did
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:19.500]   when she decided to go into streaming instead of school.
[02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:21.900]   - Yeah, it was the reason I got into streaming
[02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:24.220]   'cause I was initially going to go to college,
[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:25.420]   but the pandemics,
[02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:27.340]   it was right at the beginning of the pandemic
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:29.300]   and all my classes were online.
[02:22:29.300 --> 02:22:31.900]   And I never thought, ever since I was 12,
[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:33.660]   my dream was school
[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:37.900]   and I saw myself nowhere else than going to university.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:40.420]   And I thought of it and kind of weighed out the risk.
[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:41.700]   I'm like, "Well, if I take a gap year
[02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:43.940]   and I try streaming with my sister,
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:45.140]   what do I have to lose?"
[02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:47.340]   I gained some experience working with someone
[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:49.820]   who has a lot more experience than I do.
[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:52.300]   And then I can go back to school after.
[02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:53.960]   And if I go to school right now,
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:55.420]   I do online classes for a year
[02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:57.340]   and that's something that I could do at any time.
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:00.900]   So that's why it made a lot of sense for me to go into this.
[02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:04.220]   But of course, this is also a very unique opportunity.
[02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:05.580]   So I don't know how applicable,
[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:07.700]   but I do think overall the calculated risk
[02:23:07.700 --> 02:23:08.540]   is a really good lesson.
[02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:10.340]   - So life is like chess.
[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:11.380]   (all laughing)
[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:12.860]   - Exactly. - Maybe sometimes.
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:13.820]   - Exactly.
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:15.940]   - You also, have you considered a career
[02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:16.860]   in professional fighting?
[02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:20.260]   I saw you did a self-defense class, you did a little jiu-jitsu.
[02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:22.860]   - Did you see the 10-year-old kid who-
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:24.220]   - Throwing her? - Threw her?
[02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:26.500]   - Yes, and apparently I could have broken a leg.
[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:29.380]   But it's actually funny, like chess boxing is a thing
[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:31.380]   and I have been doing a lot of boxing.
[02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:33.620]   Physical activity is like,
[02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:36.020]   honestly, one of my favorite things to do.
[02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:38.300]   And I have been testing it out on content.
[02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:40.060]   And we have a creator friend
[02:23:40.060 --> 02:23:42.060]   who's hosting a chess boxing tournament,
[02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:45.820]   but there's no woman who's could match me, unfortunately,
[02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:50.140]   'cause all the opponents are male and I can't fight a guy.
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:51.700]   - How does chess boxing work?
[02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:54.180]   - So you do a round of chess and a round of boxing.
[02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:56.540]   And we actually did a training camp for it before.
[02:23:56.540 --> 02:23:59.380]   And of course, like after you go into the ring-
[02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:00.220]   - Is this real?
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:01.060]   Is this serious? - Yes, it's amazing.
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:03.340]   - We went to a London chess boxing club.
[02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:04.180]   - And like, after you get-
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:05.140]   - No, it seemed like videos,
[02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:07.020]   I thought it was something you do in Russia or something.
[02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:08.180]   - No, it's a real sport.
[02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:09.420]   - Yeah, it's a real sport. - Yeah.
[02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:10.460]   No, it's very cool.
[02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:12.320]   - But after you get really tired,
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:13.980]   you're more likely to make a mistake
[02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:16.060]   and you call them Jaffers or something.
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:17.300]   - Yeah, that's probably a good strategy,
[02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:19.380]   is like, what do you want to,
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:21.340]   because some of it is a cardio thing.
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:23.740]   Do you wanna work on your chess or your boxing?
[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:25.580]   - They do both, it's very fun.
[02:24:25.580 --> 02:24:27.140]   But yeah, from a content perspective,
[02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:28.740]   I'm sure there's a lot of people that like-
[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.060]   - And it's also very entertaining.
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:31.540]   - Would love to see.
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:33.820]   - Yeah, I don't wanna see Andrea getting hit.
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:35.540]   That would be- - I would love to-
[02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:36.620]   - Unless she doesn't get hit.
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:37.740]   - I would get-
[02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:39.660]   - Our roommate fought in a fight
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:42.340]   and she did end up winning, but seeing her get hit,
[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.740]   I thought I was gonna throw up off screen.
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:44.940]   - I just think it was so cool.
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:47.140]   She had no experience in boxing whatsoever.
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:49.540]   And then coming from someone in the content world
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.140]   where you start like waking up six days a week at 6 a.m.
[02:24:52.140 --> 02:24:53.500]   and she's training every day,
[02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:55.820]   like a real professional athlete,
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.220]   I think it's such a unique experience
[02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:00.620]   and also a really test of how much
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:02.900]   you can really commit to this and progress.
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:05.100]   And I think that's really rewarding.
[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:06.900]   - Did you ever end up doing the marathon
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:08.980]   with David Goggins that you were training?
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:11.820]   - No, I got injured, but we're gonna do it soon.
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:15.540]   That's on my bucket list, just to see what your limits are.
[02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:16.380]   - You're ready to do it?
[02:25:16.380 --> 02:25:18.220]   - What did you do leading up to this?
[02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:21.020]   - Nothing. - You're just gonna go into it.
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:22.580]   - It's mental anyway.
[02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:25.140]   But I do run a lot to make sure there's no,
[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:29.980]   you have to have a base level of fitness
[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:32.300]   to make sure your body doesn't completely freak out.
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:36.340]   But other than that, 50 plus miles is just about
[02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:39.500]   taking it one step at a time
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:42.220]   and just being able to deal with the suffering
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:43.780]   and all the voices, the little voices
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:44.900]   that tell you all the excuses,
[02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:47.380]   like why are you doing this?
[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:49.180]   This blister is bleeding,
[02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:53.020]   whatever the thing that makes you want to stop,
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:53.860]   just shut it off.
[02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:56.940]   - Sometimes it feels like you like pain.
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:00.140]   - No, well, no, no.
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:05.140]   But the pain does seem to show the way to progress.
[02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:07.020]   So what-- - In your turn.
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:08.940]   - In my world.
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:11.660]   Something that's really hard and I don't want to do,
[02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:14.140]   that's usually the right thing to do.
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:17.980]   And I'm not saying that's a universal truth,
[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:22.060]   it's just, if there's a few doors to go into,
[02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:24.340]   the one that I want to go into least,
[02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:27.340]   that's the one that usually is the right one.
[02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:29.860]   Afterwards, I will learn something from it.
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:31.860]   The David Goggins thing, I don't know.
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:34.180]   Listen, we're talking offline,
[02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:36.020]   the conversation with Liv,
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:38.700]   she's a very numeric, calculated risk.
[02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:39.740]   Everything is planned.
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:40.860]   I go with the heart.
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:42.900]   I just go whatever the hell.
[02:26:42.900 --> 02:26:44.860]   I think two years ago, I woke up,
[02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:50.420]   summer, I decided to tweet,
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:53.340]   I will do as many pushups.
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:55.660]   I don't know why I did this.
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:58.260]   But I will do as many pushups and pull-ups
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:00.500]   as this tweet gets likes, something like that.
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:05.860]   And then it got like 30,000.
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:08.380]   - Once you put it out on the internet,
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:09.220]   you're held accountable.
[02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:11.580]   - Well, for myself, I mean, in some sense.
[02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:12.940]   And then that's when,
[02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:15.540]   I already was connected to David at that point,
[02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:16.940]   but that's when he called me.
[02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:19.820]   And then I have to do it.
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:20.660]   And then I did it,
[02:27:20.660 --> 02:27:21.500]   and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done.
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:23.100]   - How long did you take?
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.980]   - I did it for seven days and I got injured.
[02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:27.580]   So I did about a few thousand.
[02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:29.860]   - Wait, so this is what got you to be injured?
[02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:30.980]   This tweet? - This challenge?
[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:31.820]   - No, it's different.
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:32.660]   I keep getting injured.
[02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:34.340]   I keep getting injured doing some stuff.
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:36.580]   But this particular thing, I started doing the,
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:39.140]   you don't realize that you have to really ramp up.
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:42.500]   So I got like overuse injury tendonitis
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:46.060]   on the shoulder all the way down to the elbow.
[02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:49.940]   So I took like eight or nine days off
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:51.260]   and then started again.
[02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:55.100]   And then it took about 31 days to do.
[02:27:55.100 --> 02:28:01.580]   The number was like 26, 27,000.
[02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:02.740]   Yeah.
[02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:06.220]   And it took like three, four hours a day.
[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:07.220]   - Oh God.
[02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:08.060]   - Yeah.
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:08.900]   - Sounds like torture.
[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:10.100]   - And not, you know,
[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:13.180]   and constantly asking myself, what am I doing with my life?
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:16.660]   This is why you're single was the voice in my head.
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:18.220]   This is what are you doing?
[02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:19.980]   It's like face down on the carpet.
[02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:21.660]   (laughing)
[02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:23.100]   Like exhausted.
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:24.700]   Like what, what?
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:25.740]   Because of a tweet?
[02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:26.860]   What is this?
[02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:28.500]   - Did you record it or you just--
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:30.340]   - I did, I did record it for myself.
[02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:31.180]   - Okay.
[02:28:31.180 --> 02:28:32.900]   - Now imagine doing this every day
[02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:34.940]   and that's what it's like to be a Twitch streamer.
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:35.780]   Just kidding.
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:37.100]   - Right. - Doing stupid things.
[02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:37.940]   - Thanks for the content.
[02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:39.220]   - That was really important to me actually
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:41.100]   to not make it into content.
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:43.340]   You know, I recorded everything.
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:44.980]   So maybe one day I could publish it.
[02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:48.380]   I recorded it mostly because it's really hard to count.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:49.220]   - Yeah.
[02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:50.380]   - When you get exhausted.
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:51.220]   - Yeah.
[02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:54.660]   - Like I just, so you actually enter the Zen place
[02:28:54.660 --> 02:28:58.100]   where with pushups, where it's just like,
[02:28:58.100 --> 02:28:59.700]   it's almost like, like breathing.
[02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:02.620]   You get into a rhythm and you can do quite a lot.
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:04.100]   But I wanted to make sure, like,
[02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:05.580]   if I actually get this done,
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:08.900]   I want there to be evidence that I got it done
[02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:10.500]   for myself so I can count it.
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:12.220]   I had this idea that I would use machine learning
[02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:15.100]   to like automatically process the video to count it.
[02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:17.540]   But then like after like 10 days,
[02:29:17.540 --> 02:29:19.020]   I didn't even give a shit what anyone thought.
[02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:20.260]   It was about me versus me.
[02:29:20.260 --> 02:29:21.180]   (laughing)
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:22.020]   I didn't even care.
[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:22.860]   - That's the main thing.
[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:23.700]   - Lex versus Lex.
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:24.540]   - Yeah.
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:25.940]   And then, yeah.
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:27.500]   And David was extremely supportive.
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:28.660]   But that's when I realized like,
[02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:31.160]   I really want to go head to head with him.
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:34.700]   Yeah, those kinds of people are beautiful.
[02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:35.980]   They really challenge you to your limits,
[02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:37.060]   whatever that is.
[02:29:37.140 --> 02:29:40.100]   It's like, the thing is physical exercise
[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:42.820]   is such an easy way to push yourself to your limit.
[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:44.620]   There's in all other walks of life,
[02:29:44.620 --> 02:29:46.380]   it's trickier to configure.
[02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:48.780]   Like how do you push yourself to your limits in chess?
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.420]   It's hard to figure out.
[02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:51.260]   But like in physical--
[02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:53.180]   - Do you think it's ever dangerous?
[02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:54.020]   - Yeah.
[02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:56.100]   And that's why it's beautiful.
[02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:56.940]   The danger--
[02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:57.780]   - She just likes the pain.
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:00.020]   I don't like that your eyes lit up as I said.
[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:01.260]   - Yeah.
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:04.780]   - Like if you don't know how you're gonna get out of it,
[02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:07.260]   you're gonna have to figure out something profound
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:09.240]   about yourself.
[02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:13.060]   And I mean, one of the reasons I went to Ukraine
[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:18.060]   is I really wanted to experience the hardship
[02:30:18.060 --> 02:30:23.980]   and the intensity of war that people are experiencing
[02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:25.980]   so I can understand myself better,
[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:27.440]   I can understand them better.
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:30.740]   So the words that are leaving my mouth are grounded
[02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:32.860]   in a better understanding of who they are.
[02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:36.060]   I mean, the running a lot with David Gong
[02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:39.340]   is a much simpler thing to do,
[02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:42.420]   simpler way to understand something about yourself,
[02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:44.460]   about like the limits of human nature.
[02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:47.740]   I think most growth happens with voluntary suffering
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:50.220]   or struggle, involuntary self,
[02:30:50.220 --> 02:30:52.680]   that's where the dark trauma is created.
[02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:55.860]   But I don't know, maybe it is,
[02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:57.500]   maybe I'm just attracted to torture.
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:59.540]   - And what is it that your mind does
[02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:02.060]   when you're going through this involuntary suffering?
[02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:03.900]   - I think,
[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:15.900]   there's like stages.
[02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:17.780]   First, all the excuses start coming,
[02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:20.380]   like, why are you doing this?
[02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:23.380]   And then you start to wonder like,
[02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:26.940]   what kind of person do you want to be?
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:28.420]   So all the dreams you had,
[02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:30.440]   all the promises you made to yourself and to others,
[02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:34.540]   all the ambitions you had that haven't come yet realized,
[02:31:34.540 --> 02:31:39.540]   somehow that all becomes really intensely like visceral
[02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:41.500]   as the struggle is happening.
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:46.500]   And then when all of that is allowed to pass from your mind,
[02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:49.300]   you have this clear appreciation
[02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:50.800]   of what you really love in life,
[02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:53.020]   which is just like just living,
[02:31:53.020 --> 02:31:57.300]   just the moment, the like, step at a time.
[02:31:57.300 --> 02:32:00.060]   I think what meditation does and it's most effective,
[02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:02.460]   it's just that pain is a catalyst
[02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:05.020]   for the meditative process, I think.
[02:32:05.020 --> 02:32:07.900]   For me, for me, I don't know.
[02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:10.700]   Magnus said there's no meaning to life.
[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:11.600]   Do you guys agree?
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:14.420]   Or no?
[02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:15.500]   Why are we here?
[02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:20.500]   - I do not know why we're here,
[02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:25.500]   but I do know that having some kind of meaning
[02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:29.180]   that I give my own life makes it
[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:32.000]   a lot more motivating every day.
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.980]   So I just try to focus on finding meaning within my own life,
[02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:37.400]   even if I know it's just self-imposed.
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:40.720]   - And then chess is a part of that?
[02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:44.860]   - Chess is a part of it.
[02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:47.780]   Maybe it was more so when I was younger
[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:50.100]   'cause it was easier to just feel like
[02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:52.140]   I want to improve as a person
[02:32:52.140 --> 02:32:55.060]   and to use chess to kind of measure
[02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:57.220]   some kind of self-improvement.
[02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:00.460]   And now it's more different than that.
[02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.860]   And I think I need to once again find
[02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:06.940]   what that Northern Star is.
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:09.740]   Basically, I need to have a why for why I'm doing things
[02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:12.240]   and then I feel like I could do very hard things.
[02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:18.500]   - What role does love play in the human condition?
[02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:20.300]   Alex and Andrea.
[02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:23.140]   - I'll let Andrea start this one since I took the last.
[02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:26.820]   - Sure, and yeah, just to add my answer for the last one.
[02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:30.740]   I also kind of think, well, life is meaningless,
[02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:32.820]   but I like the stoic idea where that's something
[02:33:32.820 --> 02:33:35.260]   that you live to revolt against.
[02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:37.440]   But for the second question.
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:41.180]   - The revolt against the fundamental meaninglessness
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:43.260]   of life, I like it. - Yes, exactly.
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:44.300]   - Yeah.
[02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:45.780]   - It was what does love play?
[02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:47.100]   What role does love play?
[02:33:47.100 --> 02:33:48.660]   - Yeah, in the human condition.
[02:33:48.660 --> 02:33:51.240]   - The way I see it,
[02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:56.240]   I, love is a reason you want to share experiences
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:33:59.200]   with other people.
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:00.040]   That's how I see it.
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:01.320]   Like the people you really love,
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:04.220]   you wanna share the things you're going through with them.
[02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:06.520]   - The good and the bad.
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:08.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:09.820]   That's my simple take on love.
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:16.820]   - My take on it is that part of what it is to be human
[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:20.600]   is to be somebody who feels things emotionally
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:25.260]   and love is one of the most intense feelings you can have.
[02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:28.480]   Obviously there's the opposite of that
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:30.060]   and there's things like hate,
[02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:33.200]   but I think the love you feel for people like your parents
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:35.760]   and your friends and romantic love in that moment
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:40.100]   is much more intense than in other situations.
[02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:44.480]   And I think it's also just very unique to humans
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:46.920]   and that's what I appreciate about it.
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:49.400]   - Maybe that's the meaning of life.
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:52.240]   Maybe that's what the Stoics are searching for.
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:54.640]   Andrea, Alex, thank you so much for this
