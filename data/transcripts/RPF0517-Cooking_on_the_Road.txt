[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.920]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.760]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.400]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.160]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.000]   This week we've had some pretty deep and heavy philosophical discussions.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.760]   I wanted to switch it up right now and talk to you a little bit about how to save money
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.480]   while cooking on the road.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:30.120]   I'm going to give you some very, very, very practical tips.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.600]   I enjoy traveling.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.200]   Sometimes I enjoy traveling more than others.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.040]   There are times in which travel is a real joy and there are times in which travel is
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.680]   a lot of work.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.400]   But I think most of us are going to engage in some kind of travel and that travel may
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.120]   be for fun and for pleasure because we're really into it.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.360]   That travel may be because it simply is something that we should do and need to do to help our
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.680]   business, our career to expand.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.280]   I make a recommendation to you that you plan to go to, say, about four seminars per year,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.160]   one per quarter, seminars that are in your industry or the conventions that are appropriate
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   to your work.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.920]   Well, if you're going to do that, there's an expense associated with that and that expense
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.060]   can be very significant.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.200]   It wouldn't be unusual for somebody who wants to attend a convention or a workshop or a
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.760]   class or a seminar that will help further their career.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.360]   It wouldn't be unusual for that to cost a thousand bucks just for a two or three-day
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   seminar.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.200]   Maybe it's a couple hundred dollars for your ticket, a few hundred dollars for your flight,
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.440]   a couple hundred dollars for your hotels, and a couple hundred dollars for your food.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440]   That's really significant.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.300]   And if you start doing that regularly, two, three, four times per year, that could add
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.320]   up to multiple thousands of dollars.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.080]   And the same thing would apply if you're just traveling for fun.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.760]   You want to go on a trip with your family, with your wife, with your husband, with your
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   children.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.280]   That can very quickly add up to significant amounts of money.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.720]   And I want to give you some ideas to help you defray those costs because there is a
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.760]   certain amount of travel that I think is really important and valuable for you to do.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.080]   And if you're going to go to a seminar, there's a big difference in your travel plans.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.360]   If you're going to go to a workshop or a convention that's helpful to you in your career, there's
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.720]   a big difference in how you can approach that.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.600]   So I've talked at other times about how you can minimize your costs.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.880]   I talked about the idea of, for example, staying in your car.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.280]   I've done that many times at conventions and workshops.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.640]   I sleep in my minivan, put a nice mattress in there.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.600]   That saves me hundreds of dollars on hotel bills.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.080]   You might be adventurous enough to do that.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.180]   Or maybe you have a small RV or you stay with a friend or you just get a good hotel deal.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.500]   You can figure out ways to minimize those costs.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.240]   You can always cut your costs of entrance to the seminar if you are a speaker.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.600]   That's one of the most valuable benefits of speaking in public.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.480]   I frequently, routinely speak at seminars.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.960]   And my major, I don't necessarily always get a fee, but sometimes I'll do it just for entrance
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   into the seminar.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.200]   And that saves me a few hundred bucks.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   It's great.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   It works out fine.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.960]   I don't mind giving a 30-minute talk or a 60-minute talk or participating in a breakout
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.600]   session or sitting on a panel if that'll save me a few hundred bucks.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.100]   I'm happy to do that.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.360]   And then especially if it's something that's in my industry where my opinion and advice
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.480]   is going to be useful, then that's the right context for it.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.720]   And then the expenses of getting places, sometimes that's more straightforward.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.640]   I think most of us do our best with shopping airplane tickets or driving there if you need
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   to.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.160]   But one of the things I haven't talked a lot about is food.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.560]   And food can be a significant expense.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.440]   It can especially be a significant expense if it's not just you as an individual.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.680]   As an individual, especially if you're an adult individual, there are lots of things
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.920]   that you can do to save on your food.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.080]   I frequently will engage in some simple strategies when traveling such as eating less frequently.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.720]   I'll often only eat a couple of meals a day.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.520]   Generally, we don't really need three meals a day, especially if we're not doing heavy
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   manual labor.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.040]   So a couple of meals per day will get you through.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.120]   I'll frequently try to eat a breakfast at a place that serves a very large breakfast,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.720]   maybe a buffet, and I'll intentionally overeat at breakfast time, so knowing that I'm not
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.440]   going to eat again until the evening time.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.600]   As an individual, it's relatively easy for you to just take some basic snack foods, whether
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.440]   you travel with a bag of nuts when you are getting on the airplane so you don't have
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.060]   to buy airplane food, or if you make your own trail mix, or those types of tricks.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.240]   Those are simple kind of entry-level stuff that you should be doing, and that's relatively
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.440]   simple to do as an individual.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:34.040]   And frankly, as an individual, money is just—sorry, food is often not that big of an expense.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.240]   In just about any city in the world, any American city, you could eat on $10 to $15 a day as
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.280]   an individual if you're willing to be flexible.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.420]   Maybe that means a few dollars to pick up a breakfast sandwich somewhere.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.840]   Maybe it means a few dollars for an inexpensive fast food hamburger or a couple of tacos from
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.440]   a taco truck.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   And then maybe you allow yourself one full restaurant meal.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.960]   You can go into just about any city in the world in most normal environments, and you
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.800]   can find a mid-to-low-tier mass-market restaurant where you can purchase a hamburger and fries
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.960]   for $8 to $10.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.640]   So you bring in a tip on top of that, drink water, and you can do it on $15 a day.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.400]   $20 a day, very without a problem.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.840]   If you're just going for a three-day convention, if you set yourself a food budget of $15 or
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.240]   $20 a day over three days, that's really not that disruptive to a budget.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.040]   It's not, in the grand scheme of things, that big a deal.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.880]   But all of that changes if you're not only one person or not only two people.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.120]   And this is something that those of you who are single or who are simply married and operating
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.380]   as a couple, you may not appreciate this the way that those of us who have children do.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.000]   People talk a lot about the expenses that children bring into your life.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   That's fine.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I think it's fine to look at those things.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.640]   I think many of those estimates that we read from time to time, "Children will cost you
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.920]   $150,000 to raise," are stupid.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.640]   They're dramatically overinflated.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.560]   Children will cost you as much money as you have or as little money as you have, and you're
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.000]   the one who decides how much they cost you.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.480]   So I like to discard many of those things because the cost of children is generally
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.640]   not a multiplied cost.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.320]   For example, it doesn't cost you if you have – let's say that you're married, you have
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.300]   a wife and you have two children.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.300]   It doesn't cost you four times as much to have a house that can accommodate a family
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.480]   of four than it does for you to have a house that can accommodate a family-size unit of
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   one.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.680]   It doesn't cost you four times as much to do that.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.120]   It doesn't cost you four times as much to drive around in a vehicle that can accommodate
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.760]   your family of six than it does for you to drive around in a vehicle that can accommodate
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.200]   your family of one or two.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   It just simply doesn't.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   Children don't cost – there's not a straight additional cost for each and every one of
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.120]   them in most categories.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:19.000]   But there are a few categories in which children absolutely will multiply on a one-to-one ratio
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.640]   your expenses.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:27.920]   And one of those categories is food, especially when it comes to food of eating out.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.720]   Now there is an increased cost of food when you are buying groceries.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.160]   However, that increased cost is not just times four.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.520]   But there is an increased cost.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.040]   But when you are going out to a restaurant, if you're going out with your family of four,
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.300]   especially if they are not children who are going to pick at a few bites and be done or
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:52.900]   to order off a kid's menu, there is a 4x cost for a family size of four that's different
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.620]   than one.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.540]   Everything multiplies.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.040]   Now everything doesn't multiply when you're doing groceries because you can purchase a
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.780]   larger quantity for just a little bit more money.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.700]   There is a bigger quantity with the quantity of food.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.760]   But frankly, the quantity of food, at least basic ingredients, for much of the food that
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.460]   most of us eat is really not that big a deal.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.220]   There's a cost of heating up the food, cooking the food, the utensils, but those things aren't
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.220]   times four.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.580]   But in a restaurant, they are.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:27.180]   If you've got three teenagers in your household, you know that it costs you five times as much
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:33.060]   to go out to dinner with your three teenagers as it does to go out to dinner by yourself.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.780]   Because the teenagers just aren't happy, like my children still is, picking off of my plate.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.140]   That's not going to work with your teenager.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:46.140]   Your teenager would prefer to have their own glass of strawberry pink lemonade, not to
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.860]   have a few sips from yours.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.340]   And so it costs you five times as much.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.140]   That can be a real problem when it comes to traveling.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.820]   Now of course most of us with children learn new skills, and I'm in the process of learning
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.180]   those new skills to deal with it.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.260]   You'll frequently find that families will approach things differently.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.500]   And it's by necessity.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:12.220]   If you're going to take a trip, whether that's your annual pilgrimage upstate to visit your
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.460]   family for Christmas, or if you're going to go on your weekend at the local resort or
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.420]   go down to Disney or wherever, you've got to learn new strategies to deal with it.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.500]   And since the money is not infinite, many of those strategies involve saving money.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.900]   So I want to give you some specific tips and tactics here.
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.140]   And I think these are really valuable because if you'll implement these, and if I can get
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.540]   your creative juices firing where you can start to plan ahead, if you'll implement some
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.260]   of these things, then they'll be helpful for you and will probably free you up to be able
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260]   to get more value even out of your trip.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:53.380]   I, like you, really enjoy the gastronomic experience of travel.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.980]   It's super fun.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.100]   That's part of visiting a place.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.160]   Engaging with local cuisine, whether it's a down home Louisiana jambalaya or whether
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.700]   it's fried crickets, all of these are part of the fun of traveling.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:16.220]   I love to get up early and go and sit by the fireplace and have a tremendous meal on a
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.180]   beautiful snowy day or to go to some great place that you've always wanted to go to.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.140]   I think of many experiences that I've been fortunate to have.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.780]   I remember I went to, in the James Bond movie, Casino Royale, which was one of the really
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:38.140]   popular James Bond movies a decade ago, where they were just changing the whole series over.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:46.700]   The main hotel from that is actually a hotel called the Grand Hotel Poop in Karlovy Vary,
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.220]   Czech Republic, and poop is spelled P-U-P-P.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.660]   The Grand Hotel, I think that's how you pronounce it, poop, Grand Hotel Poop, maybe pop, let's
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.660]   go with that.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.620]   Grand Hotel Pop in Karlovy Vary, which is a little resort town in the Czech Republic
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:07.380]   that is famed for its, what is it, the spring water, the tonic, I forget what it is, but
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.300]   basically the water is supposed to have these tonifying effects.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.220]   So it's this famous resort town where people would come from all over Europe to go there
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.220]   and it's a beautiful hotel.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.260]   I was in the Czech Republic and of course we went and had a great big breakfast there
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.700]   and just to enjoy the whole experience of being in this magnificent, beautiful hotel
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:31.220]   that was used as the backdrop for the Casino Royale, the James Bond.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.540]   I was single at the time.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.100]   It was easy to do as a single man, but you know what?
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.860]   Even with my children, I still would want to do that.
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:45.100]   I still would want to enjoy those gastronomic experiences, but for me to enjoy those peak
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.540]   experiences, I'm going to need to minimize in some other areas.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:55.180]   I don't want to just go to Ruby Tuesdays and eat out and have a breakfast at Cracker Barrel
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.940]   every single morning, which with a family of five, it'll cost you $70 and then go and
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:07.820]   have some mediocre, normal food experience at some mid-tier mass market restaurant.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.220]   I want to enjoy the richest experience that I can.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:18.020]   I want to go to the steakhouse on the 51st floor.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.540]   I want to go to the Korean barbecue place that is just world renowned.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:29.940]   I want to go and eat the xuelongbao, the Shanghai dumplings from the world famous restaurant,
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:35.060]   which in my opinion is one of the best places for you to go if you're traveling and if you
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:40.940]   have the chance to go to a city where there's a restaurant called Din Tai Fung.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.940]   They're in Hong Kong.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.940]   There are a couple of locations in Hong Kong.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.420]   I think there's one in Shanghai and Singapore.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.420]   They've expanded around the world.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.420]   There may be one in Tokyo.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.380]   We're in a place where you can get xuelongbao.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.020]   It's the name of the specific kind of pork dumpling.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.020]   It's a dim sum type of dumpling, but it's very intensive.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.340]   Sorry, one of my favorite foods in the world.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:10.340]   It's called xuelongbao, X-I-A-O-L-O-N-G-B-A-O, or you can just call it Shanghai dumplings.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:21.620]   But it's this just delicious pork mixture that gets wrapped up inside of a wrapper and
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.100]   it gets cooked in a steamer basket.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.420]   It just has this ... I don't even know how to describe it.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.420]   It's amazing.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.460]   So I want to take my whole family out and I want to go to Din Tai Fung and I want to
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.740]   spend ... It's not even that expensive there.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.100]   I want to spend the money to have those peak experiences.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.260]   I don't want to waste my money on mediocre food just to get the budget through.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.620]   I want to enjoy that aspect of it.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.540]   But in order for you to do that, you're going to have to cut back because most of us, you
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.140]   can't ... It's too expensive to do that all the time.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.700]   And so the best way for you to cut back is to figure out some ways for you to cook some
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.260]   of your basic food for yourselves on the road.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.860]   But this is going to require some planning.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:10.580]   Now I want to ... There is a measure of simplicity to this that you don't really need anything
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.300]   more than me just to say, "Figure out how to eat cheap on the road by having your own
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.500]   food with you."
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:22.340]   You can take a loaf of bread, a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jelly with you and you can
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.060]   eat peanut butter and jelly three times a day and you can survive.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.220]   And frankly, it's not that bad.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.020]   But it does get really boring.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:35.860]   And in terms of the richness of travel, there's a big difference for you and there's a big
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.940]   difference for your children of how good it feels to have a long day traveling, maybe
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:47.500]   a long day out sightseeing or a long day on the road, to come into your hotel room and
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.620]   to sit down and eat a cold peanut butter or a room temperature peanut butter and jelly
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.260]   sandwich.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.060]   That's very different than if you can come into your hotel room and sit down for a nice,
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:04.380]   fresh, hot meal, maybe some hot rice, a fresh pork roast, something like that.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.980]   There's a big difference to those things.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.980]   And it's not that hard to cook on the road, but you got to have a little bit of gear.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.100]   So that's enough preamble to ... Let's get into some of the ideas.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.580]   Here's some things that I want you to think about.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.500]   Number one, are you traveling in the car or are you traveling on an airplane?
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.180]   There's a big difference, of course, between these two in terms of the amount of gear that
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.460]   you can have and what you can bring with you.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:35.620]   Don't think just because you're in an airplane you can't take things with you.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.580]   You can.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:43.220]   No matter whether you're flying from New York City to Paris, you can still take food with
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.900]   you, food and cooking utensils.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.300]   You may have to take a much more basic kit.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:57.100]   You may have to really streamline, simplify, lighten and minimize what you're doing.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.540]   But you can still take things with you in an airplane.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.700]   It is, of course, easier to take things with you in a car.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.260]   And many of the times with families, you'll wind up traveling in a car more.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:12.660]   One of the other areas where kids are absolutely five times as expensive is when it comes time
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.940]   to buying airplane tickets.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.740]   Pretty easy for ... I live in Florida.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.620]   There are cheap tickets all the time up to the Northeast.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.580]   Pretty easy for me as a single man or my wife and I to pretty much grab a ticket up to the
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.620]   Northeast any time.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.620]   That's cheap.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.980]   When you multiply that times five, all of a sudden you need a really good ticket deal
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.500]   in order for that to be the best move.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.060]   And it becomes a lot cheaper and easier just to maybe just get in the car.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.100]   I had a day on the road and you can get somewhere.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.540]   So that's why families will tend to use more car travel.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.300]   The great thing about car travel is it does give you the ability to carry more stuff with
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.000]   you generally.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.660]   But don't think that it's just one or the other.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.020]   If you are traveling on an airplane, you're flying somewhere, staying at a resort, staying
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:02.780]   at a hotel, renting a cabin, getting an Airbnb, or you're renting a car there, still seriously
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.260]   consider and add to your packing list some cooking gear that you may or may not need.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.300]   Many times a family will choose to rent a place that has equipment such as renting a
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.820]   house or a cabin or an Airbnb facility where they're going to give more equipment.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.620]   One of the benefits is that you can cook for yourself more easily than if you're in the
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.260]   best Western.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.100]   But even if you're in the best Western, I want to give you some ideas.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.060]   If you're flying on an airplane, don't be scared to take an extra bag or pack an extra
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.060]   bag.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.340]   And there is this place, I think this is the place where checking bags is really great.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.380]   Everyone has a different philosophy on checked baggage.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.740]   I know people who refuse to carry on baggage and I always admire how light and free they
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.420]   are when you see someone walking on an airplane and they got nothing more than a book under
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.580]   their arm.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.220]   I've always operated under the assumption that there are two kinds of baggage, carry
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.940]   on and lost.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.420]   And so I've always carried on and I've always tried to have the smallest bag possible because
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.020]   that makes you much more mobile.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.620]   But that has to change.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.380]   That changes when it's just me versus when it's me and multiple other people that I'm
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.260]   responsible for.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.580]   In order for me to handle things and be adequately prepared, there comes a place to check the
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.580]   bags.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.740]   And I'm not scared to check a bag full of cooking gear if that's what it comes to.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:24.340]   The two basic things you need to plan for is how to keep your food and how to cook your
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.500]   food.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:32.860]   Now there are many options and you can choose something that is as simple or as gourmet
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.540]   as will be appropriate for you and your family.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:43.660]   There are plenty of ways that you can eat without any need to keep food fresh.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.100]   You can eat peanut butter and jelly.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.060]   And yeah, they say refrigerate after opening with a jar of jelly, but you can keep a jar
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.700]   of jelly unrefrigerated for a week and it's not going to have a bit of a problem.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.580]   So you could just take your peanut butter and jelly and there's no need to refrigerate
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.580]   it.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.740]   You can take a bag of almonds and soak them a little bit to soften them up and you don't
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.860]   need to put yourself in a situation where you don't need refrigeration.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.220]   You can get vegetables and they can go many days without refrigeration and be perfectly
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.220]   fine.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.660]   So you don't always have to keep your food.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.260]   The big thing where you usually will wind up keeping your food is if you're getting
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.220]   into something that involves meat.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:29.020]   Meat is basically really the only guaranteed thing that you're going to need to keep it
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.620]   cool or eat it.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.460]   But even meat, there are other options that you could do.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.860]   So here's some ways that if you are, for example, traveling on an airplane and you don't have
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:43.420]   the room to bring a separate cooler with you, then don't forget about the fact that you
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.820]   can always use canned meats or bottled meats.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.580]   You can also use dehydrated meats.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.660]   And canned meats, bottled meats, dehydrated meats, all of these types of ways will allow
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:00.580]   you to have meat on the road without the need to engage with refrigeration.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:05.060]   This could also just be the time to go ahead and embrace your vegetarian side.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.500]   I've been learning how to do more vegetarian cooking, pulled back a lot on the amount of
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.760]   meat that we've been eating, and it's a skill set.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:19.700]   But the great thing about vegetarian food is that much of it can be stored and kept
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.300]   for a very long period of time without refrigeration.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.160]   Meat is where you really get into it, where you need that refrigeration.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.420]   If you're actually going to cook something, then I think your best bet, if you want meat,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:41.660]   is probably to learn more about some of the dehydrated meat options.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.260]   There are canned meat options as well.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.200]   But generally, you're going to need to look a little bit and practice a little bit to
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.660]   find it.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:55.180]   Canned tuna is, of course, crazy easy to find, and canned chicken, of course, is relatively
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.300]   easy to find.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.100]   You can actually can lots more kinds of meat, but there's not a huge commercial market for
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.100]   it.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.860]   If you wanted to have bacon, you can buy canned bacon.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.260]   And you can buy many more kinds of canned meats.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.420]   They're just not as prevalent as things like tuna and chicken are.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.640]   But look into that market and see what your options are.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.900]   You can also find some kinds of meats that are, say, packed in a foil pouch or a plastic
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:28.140]   pouch and by virtue of their method of preparation don't require refrigeration.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.820]   Obvious thing would be jerky or things like smoked salmon.
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:36.240]   There are various options, things that are smoked and dehydrated that will provide options
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.540]   for you.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:44.780]   One of my goals is to eat more and to learn how to cook with more dehydrated foods and
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.780]   freeze-dried foods.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.460]   There have been major breakthroughs in the last decade with the technologies of freeze-drying
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:58.920]   and dehydration, where at this point today you can purchase from many manufacturers dehydrated
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:04.920]   meats and freeze-dried meats and everything else as well that are really good and seem
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.480]   to have really good results.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.900]   So don't be scared.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.380]   Even if you don't have refrigeration, don't be scared to look around and learn a little
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.380]   bit.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.740]   Many things that we think need to be refrigerated don't.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.300]   Eggs, you can keep eggs for, well, if they're fresh eggs, you can keep them for many weeks
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.180]   without refrigeration.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.660]   The sailors all have learned how to, if you're going out on a sailboat, you're provisioning
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.100]   a sailboat, you can take eggs with you on the sailboat.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.540]   The key, if you're going to keep eggs without refrigeration, is a fewfold.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.180]   Number one, they need to be relatively fresh and the mass market eggs that many times that
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.420]   we buy from the supermarket are already a few weeks old.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.820]   So if you are going to be traveling without refrigeration and you want to have fresh eggs
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:54.420]   with you, then your best bet is to get the freshest eggs as possible so that you can
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.860]   keep them, that they'll be good for a longer period.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:04.580]   Incidentally, a little trick for you, using fresh eggs for hard-boiled eggs is where you
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.180]   wind up in a disaster.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.780]   So I don't know if you've ever been in this situation.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:14.380]   If you find yourself hard-boiling eggs and the eggshell won't separate from the actual
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.240]   flesh of the egg, it's probably because the egg was very fresh.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.960]   The best types of eggs to hard-boil are eggs that are old, that have been out for a few
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.060]   weeks and have had some age to them.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.060]   I don't know why.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:33.940]   I've never researched the actual molecular science of what's going on, but it's one of
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.100]   the reasons why you know that your eggs that you buy standard are a few weeks old, because
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.300]   they hard-boil really well generally when you get them from the grocery store.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.400]   But if you're going to be keeping eggs for a long time, one of the things that the sailors
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.740]   teach is you want to, from time to time, rotate your eggs.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.060]   So you flip them upside down and you keep moving them upside down.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.280]   They used to do things, I think they call it Isinglass, where they would go and create
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.600]   a brine, basically, that you would put the eggs down under for extra long storage.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.180]   And then if you're doing things like that, say keeping eggs without refrigeration, then
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:09.020]   you want to add another step to your cooking process, where instead of breaking all of
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:14.500]   your eggs into a single bowl all together, you never know if you might run into a rotten
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.500]   egg.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.980]   And so crack your eggs one at a time into a separate bowl.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.040]   So that way, if you do have an egg that's rotten, your nose will tell you, your eyes
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.300]   will tell you.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:27.260]   God gave you a good eyes, a good nose, and a good sense of discernment about food.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.380]   You know when the food's bad because it's disgusting.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.660]   So you'll know if you crack the egg if it's rotten, and that's the one that you throw
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.660]   away.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.660]   You don't eat that.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.660]   Just trust your eyes.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.620]   So many people are so squeamish and throw food away because it's reached its expiration
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.580]   date or throw food away because it's been in the fridge for three days, and this is
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.580]   absurd.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.580]   It's a waste.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.220]   Your eyes work well, your nose works well, and that's about all you need to figure out
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.700]   if you should eat something or not.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.200]   Follow your gut.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.780]   So there are ways.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.620]   You can keep many foods without refrigeration.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.460]   It's just for a shortened lifespan.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.900]   Now if you do have refrigeration, probably your best, easiest move is to just have a
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.900]   cooler.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.780]   Coolers are easy to get.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.780]   They're cheap to get.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:13.500]   You can get the cheap ones, and they're relatively easy to service.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.280]   You can buy a bag of ice at any gas station nearby.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.200]   If you're staying in a hotel room, just about every hotel is going to have an ice machine,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.540]   and so your most sensible option is to carry a cooler with you, use the ice machine in
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:32.940]   the hotel, and to just keep your cooler fresh.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.460]   Now a couple thoughts on coolers.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.180]   There has been tremendous breakthrough in cooler technology over the last few years
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:44.380]   with the development of roto-molded coolers and what they call it, roto-injection.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.820]   I think there's two technologies, something like that, but basically the Yeti style of
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.820]   cooler.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.780]   The first big brand to break into the market in a big way was the Yeti cooler, and there
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.300]   have been a bunch of other ones now that are available as well.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.740]   You can buy high-end ones.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:04.780]   You can go down to your local Walmart, and Walmart now sells roto-molded coolers under
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.280]   the Ozark Trail brand.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.740]   You could buy an Ozark Trail brand of these coolers at your local Walmart.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.560]   They have a superior technology where instead of being the old-style technology of plastic
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:23.460]   with a foam core, which would give you a few days of coverage, the roto-molded coolers
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.780]   have a superior technology where they're insulated much better.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.500]   Of course, if you're a DIYer, you can always enhance that insulation yourself.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.140]   Wrap a blanket around that cooler, make sure it's always in the shade, maybe adhere on
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.520]   some insulation to the outside if you need to do that, but you can do that with a cooler
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.580]   and you can keep yourself going.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.820]   In a hotel room, there's no reason not to have a cooler.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.540]   Grab a luggage cart to get it in and out of the hotel room.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.020]   You got fresh ice every day.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.220]   Bathtub you can pour the water into.
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.100]   It'll work really well and it'll expand your options to give you options on some of the
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.060]   things that you wouldn't otherwise have the chance to use.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.500]   You have to ask the question of do you have electricity or not.
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.980]   In a moment, we'll talk about cooking, but there are many times when you need to make
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:11.020]   sure that you plan ahead of whether you're going to have electricity available.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.900]   If you don't have electricity available to you at all, ice is, of course, a little bit
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.300]   harder to generate.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.180]   If you're out in the woods and you're not going to have access to a refrigerator or
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:29.500]   a freezer, then one of the technologies that you could consider doing is consider, if you
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:36.100]   have a car, consider getting one of these small countertop ice makers and ice machines.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.220]   The great thing about a small countertop ice maker is that it's very efficient from an
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.840]   electricity perspective and it's very, very fast.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:50.700]   The reason it's efficient is because the way that they create ice is they put the water
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:56.100]   directly in contact with, basically they have little metal fingers inside that have a coolant
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.520]   going through them, and they put the water directly in contact with that.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.660]   That's a very, very efficient way of making ice.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.700]   Many of these countertop ice makers, if you get one and you turn it on, you can go from
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:15.600]   water to a half a dozen to a dozen cubes of ice in six to 10 minutes.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.180]   Very quickly, with a small machine, you can create a significant amount of ice.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:26.400]   That means that if you're in the backcountry and you need ice to keep your cooler cold,
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.920]   one of the things that you should consider is grab an inverter to hook up to your battery,
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:38.340]   to use the battery in your car, and then use that, plug in your countertop ice maker, use
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.920]   some of the water that you brought with you, and have that create some ice for you, and
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.620]   then dump that ice into your cooler to keep your food cold.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.760]   That would be a good way, if you didn't have electricity available, figure out a way to
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.400]   use your battery or your car or a small generator to run one of those countertop ice makers
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.960]   to keep your cooler.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:03.280]   Of course, if you have the money or have the gear, you can purchase an electrical cooler
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.560]   or refrigerator or freezer.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.900]   There's been some great breakthroughs in these in the past years as well.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:16.020]   You can purchase fairly inexpensively a cooler that will run on 12-volt electricity for your
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.020]   vehicle.
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.480]   It's not a true refrigerator, it's not a true freezer, but it's a cooler.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   That can help too.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.240]   They sell it in truck stops and you can find them easily if you go and look online.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.640]   Or you can plug into a cigarette lighter socket on your car, and that's the technology that
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.480]   you use for keeping your drinks cool in your truck while you're driving down the road.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:41.280]   There are also 12-volt coolers that are well-liked in the traveling and overlanding marketplace
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.760]   now, which are very, very efficient.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.200]   They are legitimate refrigerators and they're legitimate freezers.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.240]   You can keep your ice cream cold, you can keep your beer cold, you can keep your ice
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.080]   rock hard, you can keep your meat cold.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.600]   They really, really work well.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.800]   They're so efficient that you can actually practically use them with a normal vehicle,
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.760]   a normal 12-volt battery system.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.080]   You don't have to have some triple battery backup system.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.040]   They're very, very good and they're very efficient now.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.680]   They're also very, very expensive, anywhere from $600 to $1,000 and up.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   So this is serious.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:22.320]   You would have to really be sure that you were going to get benefit from them by owning
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.240]   them for a long time if you were to pursue that path of option.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:35.200]   So that's some ideas on keeping your food cool, on cooking without cooled foods.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.380]   You can do it in any circumstance.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:44.280]   If you're traveling to the hinter boonies in Africa, then go ahead and just toss in
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.520]   some – all you need to do is toss in some freeze-dried meals, maybe some backpackers,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.040]   mountain house type of things that are ready in a foil pack and grab yourself one of these
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.520]   little folding stoves that you can fold up into a little flat sheet of metal about the
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.800]   size of your palm.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:06.920]   And when you get to the hinter boonies in Africa, grab some twigs off the ground, stick
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.600]   that in there, borrow a pot from somebody, heat up some water and pour it into your mountain
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.640]   house.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.680]   You can eat well in that context.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.720]   If you're just loading up your family in the minivan and going to stop at the Best
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.840]   Western tonight or the cheap hotel on the road while you're on your way to grandma's
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   house, you can eat well.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.320]   So let me go on to cooking and give you some ideas on cooking.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.600]   There are about a bazillion options that you have.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.360]   Again though, you want to think through whether you have electricity or you don't.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.320]   Let's start with electricity though because that's the situation that most of us are
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   going to be in.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.640]   I'm primarily thinking about you actually being in a hotel room on the road.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.200]   Now first, if you don't have any gear, you could actually figure out how to do some stuff
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.840]   even with what's standard equipment in a hotel room.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.800]   This is in a way harder than it was before but you could figure out how to do some stuff.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   You could use the iron.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.920]   I've seen people do this where they'll take the iron and they'll use the iron as a hot
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.600]   pad or a hot plate of sorts.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.100]   Turn the iron on high.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.080]   You better have some aluminum foil but if you put a little bit of sheet of aluminum
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.360]   foil down on top of a high iron and crack an egg on that, you can fry up an egg on top
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.000]   of your iron.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.840]   You can just toss a piece of bread on that iron and you can toast a piece of bread directly
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   on the iron.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:27.880]   I've seen people take aluminum foil, wrap up a couple pieces of bacon and cook it with
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.640]   the iron on some aluminum foil on top of the ironing board.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   So you can do that.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.160]   You can use the iron and in a pinch, that may be what you're doing.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.040]   I think that's more of a gimmick than anything else.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.120]   I'm not going to cook for my family of five with an iron, at least not effectively and
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.040]   not in anything except an emergency.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.700]   But it's kind of a cool gimmick and it might be fun for you to do sometime to fry up an
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.280]   egg and a piece of toast on your iron.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.400]   Another actually more practically useful one would be the coffee maker.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.560]   This is harder to find than it used to be.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.880]   In years past, it was relatively easy to find a full-size coffee maker with a carafe in
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   a hotel room.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.440]   And that's a very useful tool because a coffee maker will easily heat water.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.080]   Once you have hot water, you can use that for oatmeal.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:17.920]   You can add instant oatmeal and whip up a pot of oatmeal in your coffee maker pot.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.000]   You can use hot water for cooking some eggs.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.520]   You're not going to be able to hard boil them because it doesn't ever actually boil.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:30.880]   But you can drop some eggs into the pot, put some hot water in there, let them sit for
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.400]   10 minutes or so and you're going to have some nice soft or medium boiled eggs.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.300]   That's perfectly reasonable.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.720]   So the coffee maker can be used to do all kinds of things.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.120]   Mostly, at least in the hotels that I've stayed in in the last few years though, those old
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:52.680]   style of carafe coffee makers have given way to an individual cup style of coffee maker.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:59.800]   And frequently, the coffee service comes with a small pouch of coffee grounds, an individual
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.640]   serving size cup and that's about it.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   Lot harder to do something with that.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   I've never tried it.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.200]   Maybe you could still soft boil an egg, one egg in each cup, but it's just not quite the
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.680]   same ease of use.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:18.480]   But don't be scared to use what is actually in there because I think there are options
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.560]   that you could pursue.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.520]   Now I think it's more practical for you to bring some gear with you.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.540]   And you can go from very simple to very complex.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:36.520]   This would depend on, in my opinion, how much you were traveling for, how long you were
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.360]   traveling for and what you actually needed.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.000]   There's no reason if you're just going to make one or two meals at a quick stopover
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.500]   in a hotel on your way somewhere, on your way to grandma's house and way back, keep
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.680]   it simple.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.000]   But if you're going to be living in a hotel for two weeks, take some gear with you so
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.120]   you can have some variety.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.220]   Your children are going to want some variety and so take some gear with you.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.240]   Now the first place I start when it comes to gear is to serve up power.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:08.200]   And I think it's very valuable for you to consider just taking a power, a spare extension
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.560]   cord and a power strip with you.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.920]   Frequently, what I have found is that the way that I want to set up my stuff, if I'm
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.640]   going to be in a hotel room for a little bit, doesn't necessarily align with the way that
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.360]   the original person said that they wanted to set up my stuff.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.520]   If you're staying in a business class hotel, it's relatively easy.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.900]   They have the lamp that's the hotel style lamp with the power outlet right in it, right
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.900]   on top of the desk.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:37.260]   That's a good place for you to plug in your cell phone charger, your laptop charger, etc.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.500]   That's fine.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:47.660]   But if you're staying at the cheapo place with the cigarette burns on the, what's the
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.780]   thing called that goes over the bed?
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.180]   The comforter or whatever that thing is called.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.820]   You know, where the cigarette burns there and you don't want to walk around with your
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:03.140]   feet off, with your shoes off because you're worried about the creepy crawlies in the carpet.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.580]   When you're staying in one of those places, usually they're not set up quite so nicely.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:13.540]   And so I always like to travel with a small extension cord and I will also set up multiple
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.840]   power strips.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.140]   And so when I go to a hotel room, one of the things that I've found very convenient to
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.300]   do is when I first get there, just I plug in my extension cord.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.820]   Usually the outlet is hidden behind the bed or something and I set up my central station.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.380]   Extension cord goes right where I want it.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:35.060]   I plug in all the travel with a four gang USB strip so I can charge multiple things
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:39.860]   when I'm charging camera batteries, cell phone batteries, various gear, plug in the laptop
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.140]   charger, whatever gear that I'm traveling with.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:47.740]   And it takes about 45 seconds to set up a station that makes the whole experience much
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.260]   more pleasurable.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.460]   Instead of having to reach over behind the TV or reach over behind the refrigerator
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.220]   to plug in this dinky little three foot Apple power cord that they gave you and you got
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.100]   your ear down while you're trying to make your calls.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.300]   A lot easier just to go ahead up and set up a station.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.500]   If you're planning on cooking, then remember to take a power cord.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:11.860]   In that case, I wouldn't take one of the small gauge ones that I carry for just simple
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.860]   electrical stuff.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:21.180]   If you're going to be plugging in a hot plate or a rice cooker or a hot pot, then I would
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.660]   take one that's a full gauge.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.180]   I take one with a strip.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:30.860]   So that way if you're in a place where the power outlets aren't set up right, you can
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.380]   still cook in a place where you have a flat surface.
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.260]   Safety is going to be really important.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.820]   And if you don't think ahead and carry with you a power cord and maybe a power strip if
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.300]   necessary, then you might wind up cooking in a wrong place where it could be safe.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:49.660]   And if you've got children, you don't want to run the risk of having a hot plate or a
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.580]   hot electric frying pan or something like that.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.900]   And it's in a place where the children could reach it or it could be danger.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.700]   So be very, very careful with that.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.000]   Also consider carrying a small table with you.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.100]   You can purchase small, lightweight, plastic collapsible tables, which would be very convenient
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.700]   in many hotel rooms.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:14.860]   Again, depending on the class of hotel, frequently if you're in a business class hotel, you're
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:21.580]   going to be staying in a place that has a nice desk.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.500]   Frequently there'll be a nice table, a nice place for you to put your suitcase.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:29.220]   If you're staying in a cheaper hotel or maybe a hotel in a different country with a different
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.300]   standard, then there may not be quite so much of a place for you to work or for where you
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.480]   – for you to be.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.860]   And so consider carrying with you a small collapsible table that you can set up and
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.860]   that you can use.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.860]   That'll make a big difference in your experience.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.440]   In terms of gear, there are various options.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.340]   But I think essentially you want to just talk about ways of heating things up.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:55.380]   And you basically have either the need to heat water, which you can do a lot with, or
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.480]   you can do – or you basically have the idea of heating up the food directly.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:07.880]   So these can be mixed and matched depending on what your approach is.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.480]   As with anything, you can have as many gadgets as you want or as few.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:19.240]   You could, for example, carry with you a single hot plate, an electric hot plate, an electric
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:23.040]   burner that just simply plugs into the wall.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.080]   It gives you a single burner and you could do everything on that single burner, whether
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.520]   that's through – with a small frying pan or a small pot that you just simply use.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.660]   You can use that to heat water.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.400]   You can use that to cook food in.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.040]   You could do everything with a small individual hot plate.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.800]   I think that's a really intelligent place to start if you have electricity.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.360]   And you can buy those very inexpensively.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.900]   I've not shopped much for them, but I've seen 10 bucks.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.160]   You could buy a super cheap one at your local Walmart.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.360]   So if you find yourself in a bind, maybe trot down to Walmart, pick up a $10 hot plate and
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.360]   pick up a cheap little pot to cook in or a little skillet to use.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.360]   That can be effective.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.760]   If you don't have electricity, the non-electric version of that is just to carry with you
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.440]   a small single burner butane stove.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.480]   A small single burner butane stove is so handy.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.400]   It works phenomenally.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.840]   You can get great cooking results.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:23.120]   If you look in a nicer hotel that sets up in the morning, Omelette Station, you'll
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:28.080]   usually either see that they're cooking on a single electric hot plate.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:32.600]   Sometimes that'll be an induction with induction technology or sometimes it'll be just an electric
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   hot plate.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:38.580]   But very frequently, I see them set up their omelette, the cooks set up an omelette station
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.240]   with a single burner butane stove.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.600]   They work really well.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.160]   You can get world-class results from a single burner butane stove.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:52.560]   And yet the whole thing packs down into something the size of a large square book.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.560]   I have one that I use that has its plastic case.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.040]   It's maybe, what, 12, 14, maybe 14, 16 inches by 14, 16 inches and about three or four inches
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.040]   thick.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   That's very, very simple.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.040]   I toss it in a bag.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.280]   And frequently, I use that for something like I toss that in the bag and put in a small
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.480]   French press.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:16.200]   And so if I'm on the road and I want to have a cup of coffee, then I can make my own coffee.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   Now, that's not necessary.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.080]   It's relatively easy to find a fairly inexpensive cup of coffee on the road.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.480]   But sometimes it's nice to do.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.080]   I've done that where I go ahead and I'm going to pull up at a rest stop, especially if I
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.800]   was staying in the car, stay at the rest stop, get out.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.960]   I just set up my little butane stove right on the picnic table, put my pot of water on,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.200]   heat my pot of water, pour it in the French press, and you've got a cup of coffee there.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.160]   Don't forget, by the way, if you're traveling, don't forget about the value of instant coffee.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.760]   Instant coffee is there's some really phenomenal instant coffees now that are really good and
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   very, very convenient.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:56.160]   That's a time-honored tradition that works really well.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.920]   So get yourself a little single burner butane stove.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.600]   You'll need to carry with you a couple extra butane canisters.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.460]   That won't work if you're flying.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.680]   You have to check into that, but it'll work fine if you're in the car.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.280]   So a hot plate, I think, is a really good place to start.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:17.040]   A second tool that I think is really worth your considering would be a, I'll call it
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.800]   a hot pot, but basically an electric water heating pot.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:29.240]   Again, these range from the cheap and simple to the very complex.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.720]   You probably have one of these already in your house.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.480]   Just grab that one off the counter.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.400]   But an electric kettle or electric hot water heater where you just push a button and it
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.180]   raises the water temperature to a boil for you is so useful.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.800]   You can use that to create all those things, to create hot water for you, which as we talked
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.380]   about you can use for soft-boiling eggs.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:57.000]   You can use for adding that to cooked spaghetti and you can use that for heating up, you know,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.920]   making oatmeal or making a pot of ramen noodles, whatever you want to have.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.160]   That hot water heater will just be great and simple.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.760]   It's very, very safe.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.520]   It's effective and it works well.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:20.320]   If you put together a hot plate with a skillet and a hot pot electric water kettle, electric
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:29.080]   kettle, that gives you a really powerful way to do those two things together.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.800]   That's really, really good.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.560]   And I think those should be considerations.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.600]   You can cook directly in a hot pot.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:41.480]   Think carefully before you do that with your $90 one that gives you your 170-degree tea
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:48.120]   water, your 185-degree for black tea water, your 212-degree boiling water.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.480]   I wouldn't feel all that good about dumping pasta sauce into one of those.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.280]   But you could do it with a cheap one and if that's what you've got to cook in or to cook
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   your oatmeal directly in, then go for it.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.400]   I think you can clean those things out perfectly fine.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:12.480]   The next tool that I think deserves a really valid consideration would be a crock pot.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.680]   Now there are two approaches that you could take here and with here we'll move into the
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.020]   more fancier gadgets.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.000]   But an old crock pot is easy to find.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.520]   And if I were traveling across, let's say I were traveling with my family across the
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:32.560]   country, I wouldn't hesitate to travel there and swing by just about any thrift store and
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.240]   pick up some cheap old crock pot for $8 or $10.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.800]   A crock pot gives you the ability to have just really useful, delicious meals that can
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.640]   be done for you without you sitting there intending it.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.040]   It's entirely safe for you to set up a crock pot in your hotel room.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:55.080]   Let's say that you're at a convention or a conference.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.200]   In the morning you go ahead and just like you do at home with your crock pot, you go
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.720]   ahead and if you had some meat, go ahead and brown your meat in your skillet, put it in
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.040]   the bottom of the crock pot.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.520]   Or even if you didn't have any meat, you put your potatoes in, you cut that up and even
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.760]   if you couldn't brown the meat, you just toss it in there, put in a chicken, hit start,
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:17.040]   go off to your conference all day and when you come back that night, you're ready to
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.320]   go with your crock potted meal.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.440]   Pair that up with a rice cooker that you can come home, you can set all the ingredients
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.840]   and if your rice cooker is fancy enough to have a timer, you could set that so that's
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.000]   done for you.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.560]   And you can come home to a delicious, savory, satisfying, comforting, warm meal that you
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:43.280]   can all enjoy in the hotel room or somewhere nearby and that gives you the option of having
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.880]   it ready to go.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:51.520]   Crock pots are wonderful and I think that they deserve your consideration.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:57.560]   Heavy, heavy and bulky, so won't work very well to fly with it but if you've got a space
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.760]   in the car, consider putting in your crock pot.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:09.240]   The modern take and change on the crock pot is of course the world famous instant pot.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:14.000]   The instant pot technology is basically a pressure cooker, an electric pressure cooker
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.920]   which has taken over, it's very, very popular and it's very, very popular among many travelers.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:24.600]   Many RVers for example who face this challenge of how do I cook in a small space while I'm
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.520]   traveling around love their instant pots.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.200]   And the instant pot has the benefit of having multiple functions.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.760]   They say it can be a rice cooker, you can brown your meat, saute your vegetables, all
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.000]   in the same thing and then turn it into a crock pot.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.860]   So the instant pot advertises itself as having these multiple benefits that you can do it
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.220]   all in one pot.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.960]   We recently got an instant pot during one of the Amazon sales.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.440]   We finally went ahead and tried one and got one.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.140]   I haven't learned how to cook with it yet.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:59.960]   My wife has done it a few times and it's on my list to learn more of the instant pot recipes.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:05.000]   There's a huge enthusiast, there are a lot of enthusiasts around the instant pot brand
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.480]   and around that approach.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.880]   People who work to use the instant pot to make all of their meals or to make some of
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.360]   their meals, I just simply am a neophyte when it comes to actually using it.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:24.040]   I need to learn some new approaches before I can competently discuss how to actually
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   use it.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.540]   But those resources are out there.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:30.900]   Just start looking and you'll find people who will want to teach you how to use an instant
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.060]   pot.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:37.940]   One trick that I don't currently have but I intend to get is something called a thermal
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.380]   cooker.
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.980]   And the thermal cooker is a very old technology.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:47.620]   And basically the idea is how can you cook something without using a lot of fuel?
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.580]   Well the cooking process involves two things.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:54.340]   It involves heat and it involves time.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:59.020]   And for just about anything that you cook, there is a certain temperature that you need
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:03.900]   the food to reach for a certain amount of time and that'll vary with everything that
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   you're doing.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.420]   But you're manipulating these two variables, what temperature for how long.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.700]   And so you can cook something at a very high temperature for a short period of time or
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.860]   you can cook it at a lower temperature for a longer period of time.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.780]   And so there have been many times in the past where people have learned how to cook using
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:29.260]   this lower temperature but long duration cooking methodology.
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.100]   You could cook a pig in the ground in a pit at the beach.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:40.660]   Many many tropical cultures have developed this technique where you dig a big giant hole
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.940]   in the beach.
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.220]   You start a big old fire.
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:50.580]   You fill that fire with as many rocks as you can find and you get those rocks as hot as
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.020]   you possibly can.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:57.040]   You take your big giant hole that you dug in the sand.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.460]   You line it with leaves like banana leaves or whatever you've got but big fat leaves.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.740]   Banana leaves work great.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:09.100]   And then you dump your pig in there and you dump your rocks in there on the outside of
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:14.980]   it and you dump your pig and your rocks in there, wrap it all up with leaves and then
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:19.100]   pour dirt over the top, make a big giant mound and go fishing all day.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.740]   You do that first thing in the morning.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.740]   You come back at night.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.940]   You dig the top off the pit and your pig should be cooked.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:32.460]   And it's that you've taken the heat source, the heat sink, the thermal mass which is the
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:37.860]   rocks and you've put them in a hole to help with insulation and then because it's been
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.980]   left for so long, it can cook over time.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:45.260]   The old-fashioned version of this for individuals who aren't going to dig a hole in the beach
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:50.320]   and cook a pig in it is something called the hay box where you could take and let's say
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.740]   you're going to make something in a pot.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:57.940]   You take your pot on the stove, you put it on the stove, you heat the pot of soup up
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.500]   or whatever it is that you're cooking, the stew.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:08.860]   You heat it up until it's boiling and then you turn the heat off and you put that pot
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:14.820]   into a bunch of towels and then you put it into a big box and oftentimes they would use
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.180]   a box with hay and basically an insulated box.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.600]   And you put it in that insulated box and you cover it up and you leave it alone for a long
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.060]   period of time.
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:28.860]   There's enough contained thermal energy in the pot of soup that as long as it's well
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.980]   insulated and it doesn't cool quickly, it can sufficiently cook the contents of the
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.980]   soup.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:39.820]   That saves you the benefit of having to constantly keep that pot going by adding constant amounts
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.820]   of food.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.800]   Now you can rig this up yourself.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.460]   Some people will do this in a cooler.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.060]   You can accomplish a similar effect.
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:52.060]   I frequently, when taking food to somebody's house, I'll frequently get it nice and hot
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:57.220]   then you take it off the stove, wrap it up in towels or a blanket and then put it into
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.540]   a cooler and you can transport the food and it's very, very stable.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.700]   It'll keep it hot, it'll keep it fresh and it won't overcook it because you're not adding
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.460]   more heat.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.820]   And as long as you haven't overcooked it to begin with, generally it's a very safe way
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.420]   of keeping your food hot just like the caterers do when they're serving food.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:19.060]   But there's also a, they've developed commercial products that are related to this called thermal
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:23.420]   cookers and I've never owned one but I intend to buy one.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:29.420]   And basically a thermal cooker is a very well insulated crock pot that doesn't have a heat
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:34.140]   source and usually there are a couple different ways that they approach them but it's basically
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.660]   a very well insulated pot.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:40.980]   And where these are really valuable would be in a place where you have to be very conscious
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.980]   of your fuel.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:47.140]   So in the sailing community, many people in the sailing community like a thermal cooker
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.540]   because if you're going to cook something you can just use a little bit of your gas
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.380]   to heat it up and then you put it in the thermal cooker and it'll cook all day.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:58.540]   The big benefit that I see with a thermal cooker is to have the benefit of being able
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.420]   to carry it with you without needing electricity.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.420]   Now if you've got an inverter in your car, you may be able to plug your crock pot in
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.820]   and crock pot your food while you're driving down the road.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.460]   That's fine and that's good.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:14.100]   It's hard to get an inverter in the car because you can't draw enough wattage out of the cigarette
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.100]   lighter.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.100]   So you need a big inverter.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.940]   Those need to be plugged into an actual battery.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.860]   So unless you have a second battery or you can figure out a way to rig that up, that's
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.080]   a little hard to do.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.340]   But if you can carry a thermal cooker with you, you can just fill that thing up with
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:32.340]   food and in the morning you can get it nice and hot and then you wrap it up and it'll
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.540]   sit there and it'll cook all day while you're driving down the road.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.060]   And you can do this with all kinds of food.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.800]   You can do this with fresh food.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.420]   You can do this with freeze-dried food.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:48.580]   But you can set things up so that it'll work really well for you while you're traveling
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.460]   and while you are going down the road.
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:57.980]   There are people that I found, especially from the prepper community.
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.980]   What is her name?
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.860]   The best one I know is her name is Chef Tess Bakeress.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:12.940]   Her website is cheftessbakeress.blogspot.com.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:14.700]   Chef Tess Bakeress.blogspot.com.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.700]   She has a whole cookbook.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:21.260]   She has a bunch of them, but she has a cool cookbook that's focused on how to cook what
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.700]   she calls her meals in a jar.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.420]   And it's a really wonderful technology.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:31.740]   What she does is she creates these meals that are all with freeze-dried food.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:39.420]   And so you have, again, I alluded earlier to the value of the freeze-dried food and
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.820]   dehydrated food.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.980]   But you can basically have really good quality vegetables.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:50.220]   You can have good quality even eggs, dairy, butter, meats.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.700]   And you can put all these things together and make your normal recipes.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:57.660]   And so what she does is prepares them, put them dry into a canning jar, and you prepare
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.500]   a meal in a jar that has everything together.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.840]   And then you can just get some hot water.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.840]   You add some hot water.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.580]   You toss it in your thermal cooker.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:10.100]   And when you get where you're going, you're ready to go with a pan of lasagna or a Louisiana
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.420]   chicken gumbo.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.780]   And everything's ready to go, a fresh spaghetti and sauce that's all done.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.500]   And it was all, none of it required refrigeration.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:18.820]   There was no urgency to use it.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.820]   So if you decide that you're going to go out to eat tonight, you didn't waste your food.
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.260]   It's easy to make while you're traveling and relatively inexpensive.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:32.260]   The freeze-dried food, of course, would cost you a little bit more than fresh ingredients,
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:40.060]   but you make it up in convenience, storability, the lack of spoilage and waste, et cetera.
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.180]   And so I think that's really worth looking into.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:48.540]   So I'm excited about in the future getting a thermal cooker.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.500]   So when I can actually have a need for it, then I'll get it.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.860]   But I think that's a really wonderful technology.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:56:01.900]   And so let me just explain one practical way of approaching this that would be very, very
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:06.660]   normal I think for a lot of us in terms of actual usage.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.140]   Let's say that you're going to take your family and you're going to go on a week-long family
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:11.320]   vacation.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:15.100]   So you think things through and you make a breakfast menu.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.700]   Breakfast is simple.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:23.060]   And one day you want to have some cereal.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.460]   Your family enjoys eating cereal.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.820]   I like to buy a bag of granola.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.740]   Costco has a good bag of granola.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.740]   It's all wrapped up.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:31.740]   Of course, it's granola.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.320]   It's easy to carry with you.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:42.540]   So what I do is what I've done is grab a bag of granola that is a hearty and granola still
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.320]   has sugar, but it's less sugar than Froot Loops or that type of thing.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.500]   So you get a bag of granola and then get some dried milk.
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:55.140]   And the dried milk, people used to complain about dried milk.
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:57:01.140]   I know that used to be kind of the classic tightwad way to drink milk.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:05.540]   But dried milk, you can get some really good dried milk.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.520]   I found some locally at a food supply store.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.820]   And I always try to keep it on hand because we don't drink a lot of cow's milk.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.420]   We don't drink cow's milk in our family really.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:17.100]   We use it for baking.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:21.580]   And the problem that – the fight that my wife and I have, she doesn't drink milk
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:22.580]   at all.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.580]   I enjoy it.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.100]   I don't drink it, but I'll have it on things like cereal or something on occasion or if
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.260]   I'm having a brownie.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:34.260]   But I can't stand to buy small quantities of things because I can't stand to pay the
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:35.260]   higher unit price.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.140]   I don't want to buy a half gallon of milk.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:41.420]   When we first met, she would buy her milk by the pint and I used to make fun of her.
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.220]   I was like, "Who buys milk by the pint?"
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.580]   She's like, "Well, I only needed a cup for a recipe."
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.500]   I'm like, "Still, you're buying a pint of milk.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.500]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.500]   I'd buy a gallon."
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.860]   The problem is that we don't need a gallon.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:56.980]   So then if it starts to go bad, then I start drinking milk or using it more unnecessarily.
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.660]   And so what I've mostly settled on is we'll get milk occasionally, especially if I know
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:04.460]   I'm going to be doing a lot of cooking or cooking things that are going to use milk.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:09.220]   But I like to buy dried milk and then the dried milk can easily make up a quart jar
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:10.460]   of it.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.740]   And for the best taste, you make up a quart jar of it, you put it in the fridge overnight,
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:20.200]   that lets the flavors really meld together and there's nothing objectionable about it.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.800]   And so you can get yourself some dried milk.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   There's nothing to store.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.600]   When you get to the hotel room at night in preparation for breakfast tomorrow, if you
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.260]   have a refrigerator in the hotel room or if you have a cooler, then go ahead and get a
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.340]   quart jar, measure in your dried milk.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.740]   It's with the stuff that I get.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:41.220]   It's a one and a third cups of powder and then you add water to that, shake it up and
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.700]   then put it in the cooler.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.700]   It's easy, refresh your cooler.
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:48.300]   So fill it up with ice so it'll get it nice and cold and let that sit overnight.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:53.980]   Then the next morning when you wake up, you'll be ready to go with fresh cold milk, a quart
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:58.860]   of it, which is probably just enough to go on everybody's breakfast cereal.
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:06.020]   Now you can have a bowl of granola with some milk for breakfast.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:11.020]   Or if you don't care to use the dried milk, then get yourself some UHT ultra pasteurized
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.020]   shelf stable milk.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.940]   Parmalat is the brand that we usually see here in the United States.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:18.620]   Throughout the world it goes under various brand names.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.620]   But get some of that.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:25.260]   It comes in a Tetra Pak size that doesn't need any refrigeration.
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:30.300]   Same deal, go ahead and chill it down on ice or toss it in the refrigerator in the hotel
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.780]   room and it'll be cool in the morning.
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.460]   For the first night, bring some bananas.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.940]   Those work really well.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:39.700]   You've got granola, you've got bananas.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:47.980]   That'll set you up for an inexpensive breakfast that is easy, has minimal preparation.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:50.500]   Of course your first day, maybe you go ahead and make something from home and you just
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:55.900]   bring some pre-made sandwiches with you for that first lunch and then something for the
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:56.900]   dinner.
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.680]   Let's say that you go ahead and you have a little bit of time on another day and you're
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.580]   going to cook, then here's how you can integrate some of these things together.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:10.660]   You have a hot pot and a hot plate and a thermal cooker.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:17.460]   So you use your hot pot to go ahead and boil up some eggs inside the pot and then you use
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.540]   the water from that to go on some oatmeal.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.780]   So you can have a nice hot breakfast.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:28.940]   And meanwhile on your hot plate, your electric burner, go ahead and put the thermal cooker
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:35.980]   pot there and you can work on browning your meat and then adding in some other ingredients.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:39.700]   Maybe you're making a chili or maybe you're making a stew.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.380]   Maybe you're adding some potatoes, whatever you're doing.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.780]   Go ahead and add those things in and bring that up to a boil.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:53.220]   So you can simultaneously cook a hot breakfast and go ahead and bring your evening meal and
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:58.020]   get that ready to go while you're preparing it there in the hotel room.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:04.260]   Maybe you've got the kids making sandwiches for lunch as well while you're cooking up
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.340]   breakfast and dinner.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:10.300]   Well you serve the hot breakfast, take your pot, get it up nice and hot, put it in the
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.420]   thermal cooker, close that up, clean up your stuff, pack it away.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.820]   You have your hot breakfast there in the hotel room.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:22.500]   You've got your sandwiches ready for lunch and then all day while you are touring the
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:26.820]   theme park or touring the national park or going to the zoo or you're out on the boat
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.980]   fishing all day your food is cooking there and it's ready to go so whenever you get to
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:36.220]   the end of the day and you're ready to eat it you've got a nice hot meal.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:42.340]   And obviously you can diversify your actual experience a little bit and who wants to sit
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.340]   around in a hotel room all the time and eat food on the floor?
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.580]   You go to a local park, you've got your thermal cooker with you, set it up for a picnic and
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.020]   you can have a picnic with hot and delicious food in your local park and enjoy the beauty
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.120]   of where you are.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.040]   So if you're going to plan these things out for your whole trip then you just think through
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.440]   the different options.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.640]   In the beginning of the trip perhaps you are preparing your meat.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.000]   You're going to eat meat so you freeze your meat, put it in a nice Ziploc bag or maybe
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.660]   vacuum seal the bag, freeze your meat, put it in the bottom of the cooler and you have
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:17.800]   meat for the first couple of days and your recipes for lunch and dinner revolve around
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.520]   that meat, that fresh meat.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:26.040]   Then after that you go to your plan is your dinner plans go to a vegetarian option, a
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.920]   quinoa or rice, a vegetable or something that's just a vegetarian, dried beans, lentils, that
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.640]   kind of thing that's easy to store, doesn't require any refrigeration and that'll be the
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.720]   foundation of your meals towards the end of the week, the spaghetti and the sauce that's
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.680]   canned that kind of thing.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.700]   So you can plan to have your cooled things up front and your non-cooled things towards
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:52.280]   the end of the trip or maybe that's where you start to bring out your freeze-dried recipes
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.640]   and you've prepared your freeze-dried meal in a jar.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:01.760]   For your breakfast and lunch options you plan out fresh fruit towards the beginning.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.720]   You bring some bananas, you bring some fresh apples, those things for snacks but then go
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:10.120]   ahead and bring some cans of fruit to get you to through the middle towards the end
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.240]   of your trip or you do the same thing with vegetables.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.600]   You have your fresh vegetables in the beginning and you bring some cans of vegetables to get
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.440]   you through towards the middle and the end of the trip.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:24.640]   The point of all of this is to say that a couple little things with you, a few little
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:30.360]   pieces of gear will dramatically open up your options and expand the things that are available
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   to you.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.440]   It can result in you being able to do things you otherwise wouldn't be able to afford.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.600]   You don't have a thousand dollars to go to that super important conference where all
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.440]   of your people in your business are engaging but you can get there with, but you do have
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:50.520]   $200 to buy the entrance fee and $150 for the hotel fee.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:57.240]   Well, with these ideas that I'm telling you about, you can get there and you can afford
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.440]   to eat while you're there.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:05.440]   Or if you're traveling with your family, these ideas give you the ability to eat cheap food
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.240]   when there's nothing that would be a real gastronomic or cultural experience available
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.440]   and then when you get to where you want those peak experiences or those really fine dining
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.760]   or, it doesn't have to be fine dining, but just the rich cultural experience, then you
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:27.200]   have the option to have the money still to be able to afford those solutions.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.320]   I think I'm going to quit with just a couple more things.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:37.840]   I had more on my list but I don't want to belabor this subject much more.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:43.120]   Couple of very quick options, especially if you are going to be traveling internationally.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.240]   Here I'm thinking of you're vagabonding around the world by yourself type of thing.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.760]   This is a little bit harder to do on the scale that you need for a family.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.680]   But if you're vagabonding around the world by yourself, then here are a couple of things
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.840]   for you to consider.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:04.040]   Number one, they sell an immersion heater that you can pick up.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.400]   These are much more popular in other places around the world than the US.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.200]   But in the US you can find them at least online.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.480]   I've never really seen them in stores, although I've never really looked.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.120]   But you can get an immersion heater.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.080]   And essentially what an immersion heater is, it's an electric coil that is connected to
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.680]   a wire and it can be very, very small.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:29.560]   There's nothing, it would basically be, they can be from the size of perhaps a small pill
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.320]   bottle, a little bit longer, to perhaps the size of something like an electric hair straightener
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.640]   or curling iron, that type of thing.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:44.280]   And you can get them from anywhere from tiny, they'll just go into a cup, like a mug, to
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.560]   something that'll go into a pot.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.760]   Or you can get large ones that'll heat up a five-gallon bucket of water or even a bathtub
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   full of water.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.040]   It just depends on what you need.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.320]   People use these in home brewing.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.920]   They use them in many contexts.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:03.560]   But if I were backpacking around the world on a budget, I would want to make sure that
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.880]   I had some way of heating up some water for myself.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.040]   And frequently, if you're staying in a hostel, you can have access to the kitchen.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.720]   But sometimes you don't have a kitchen and you just have a shared room in a hostel, you're
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.040]   out of money.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.040]   Having a small immersion heater would be really, really important and really valuable.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:28.060]   Gives you the ability to cook up a hot pot of rice 'cause you can heat up water.
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.240]   Gives you the ability to make some noodles, that type of thing, where you can have some
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.640]   hot food that's inexpensive.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:37.740]   You can boil vegetables, you can do those things, and it'll get you there.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.040]   You can do it in a makeshift container.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.040]   Maybe you are traveling with a stainless steel water bottle and that's what you go ahead
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040]   and use.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.680]   So you use your stainless steel water bottle with your little immersion heater down in
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.840]   it and use that to heat it up and cook some rice for yourself or to cook some vegetables
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.300]   or some oatmeal so that you can enjoy a nice hot meal.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.840]   That changes your attitude.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.120]   When you're traveling on a budget, you're vagabonding, you're in some random hostel
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.680]   sharing the room with three other people, stretching out your $15 a day budget.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.480]   It's nice to have that and that's worth considering.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:16.000]   If you're traveling in the United States in a car, the space is not such a big value.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.520]   I'd rather just have a hot pot.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.120]   But if you're getting in a backpack and traveling the world, then that would be worth doing.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.260]   If you don't have access to a hotel room, maybe you're camping or you're in a more remote
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.380]   or rural place, electricity is not a certain.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:33.800]   By the way, that technology, it's one of the things that they use in prison.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:39.460]   When the guys in prison want to heat up their food hotter, in prison commissaries, prisoners
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:47.880]   in the United States are able to buy ways of heating up, be able to buy pots, electric
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:52.120]   hot water kettles, but they have a lower boiling temperature.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.720]   They don't actually boil the water.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.560]   They're regulated and governed to not boil the water, lest that boiling water become
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.800]   a weapon for somebody who wants to commit violence against another person.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.160]   And so what they do is they have to figure out a way to do it themselves.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:12.200]   And so the solution is to make your own DIY immersion heater.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.640]   They call it a stinger.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:19.560]   And so what you do is you take a cable, you strip an electrical plug, which has a plug
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560]   in one end.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.160]   You strip the wires, you cut the cable off and you strip the wires off the other half
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:31.880]   and they take fingernail files and break them in half so you have nice metal contacts and
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   connect them up, wire them up, solder them up so you have the ability to solder, but
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.700]   connect it up to make an electrical contact.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:45.020]   And then you plug it in, you throw the ends in a cup and that creates basically an immersion
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:50.280]   heater, but the jail style, the jury rig jail style to heat up your pot of water.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:54.240]   And you can boil the water right fresh and use that boiling water for the recipes that
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.560]   you want to actually have.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.320]   So that's that immersion heater.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.840]   If you don't have it, you can rig it up for yourself.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.440]   Back to traveling in a remote area.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:09.040]   If you're traveling in a remote area, you're traveling on the cheap, take a serious look
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.960]   at some of the mini stove options.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.160]   Of course, if you're backpacking, you can get the fancy ones that come with gas.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:20.040]   A little hard to get on an airplane with a propane or a butane bottle.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.320]   Of course, those are super convenient.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.040]   They work fast and there are a bunch of them that are even self-contained ones.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.240]   Some of them have the built-in jet boil system where it's built in with the water and the
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.400]   gas system all built in.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.000]   But if I were traveling in a remote area, I would carry with me I think something like
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.160]   a small stove and there are a couple of versions of these.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.760]   There are just very, very simple stoves that you can find.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:49.440]   Firebox is one brand, but there are others that basically provide the same functionality
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.560]   as that you could rig up for yourself, a little campfire with something over it, but it's
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.200]   held in the context of a stove.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200]   That's good.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.360]   There are also some with a rocket stove technology, which are very, very efficient.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.560]   You can get these tiny little rocket stoves that fold down into their own little cook
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.880]   set, own little pot, and they come in one tiny little thing.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.520]   You can set up a rocket stove, which you can feed with basically any burnable organic matter,
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:18.760]   so some twigs or some scraps of wood or some cow chips, whatever you can find that you
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:24.000]   can feed this rocket stove with, and you can use that to give you your cooking ability.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.720]   So study what the backpackers do, study what they use, and then consider integrating that
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.720]   with yourself.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.920]   The benefit of going that way is you don't have to carry fuel with you.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.520]   You don't have to buy things like charcoal.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.720]   You can figure out some branches or some twigs or some just random detritus that you
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:45.520]   find to heat your water and/or cook on, and they're very effective.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.080]   Carry with yourself a small little backpacker pan, and you have the ability now to cook
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.840]   a legitimately delicious meal while you are traveling.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.400]   So with that, I think I am going to quit for the day on this topic.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.640]   Hopefully that you enjoyed it.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.160]   I hope that you found it to be practical.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.440]   I'm trying to be very practical here, and I hope that I've opened your eyes to some
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:13.640]   things that you can do to lower your costs.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:19.560]   I'm no expert in all these things, but these are real life new things that I'm facing.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.480]   I don't have a long history of cooking on the road like this.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.680]   Generally, it was just me.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.800]   If you're a single person, it's relatively inexpensive of just traveling every now and
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.320]   then to just buy your own food.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.000]   But there are times where I've eaten fast food multiple times in a day, two, three times
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   a day.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.760]   You can feel sick at the end of it.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:44.160]   And if you're really hardcore and you're really serious about your frugality, these types
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.240]   of things could be really, really useful for you.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.800]   I know a guy who, he lived on the road.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.540]   He was constantly traveling, and his employer would give him a per diem allowance.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:01.080]   But some of these types of things, you're traveling with a simple pot, a simple pan,
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.960]   and being able to cook in a hotel room gives him and would give him the ability to save
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:13.720]   an extra $40 a day by not using his full per diem at restaurants.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.000]   Hotel restaurants are expensive, and they got you tight because if you don't have a
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.240]   car, you don't want to go out.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.400]   Sometimes you can't find better deals.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.160]   So I hope that they will find these things are practical.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.920]   But I don't like the idea of limiting the things that you want to do just because it's
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.920]   expensive.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.080]   I don't like to go on a trip, family vacation, or go travel, or go to a conference.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.360]   I don't like the idea of limiting it just because it's more expensive.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.760]   Figure out a way to make it cheaper.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.660]   And here's the thing.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:47.620]   We have become, in our modern world, we have become so soft with the stuff that we're willing
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.620]   to do.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.560]   We've become so flabby and lazy.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.320]   And this is all an artificial construct.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:02.360]   My dad, my grandparents grew up in, my grandmother was from California, grew up in Los Angeles,
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.000]   California girl through and through.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.120]   And my dad grew up on a ranch in Colorado.
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:18.880]   But they would travel back and forth from Colorado to California sometimes for annual
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.160]   vacation or things like that.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.520]   And when they were doing that, they didn't have a hotel, they stopped at, they didn't
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.520]   have the money.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.880]   They didn't do all these fancy things.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:33.360]   What they would do is they would just pull over to the side of the road and one or two
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.840]   would sleep in the car.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.640]   My grandmother, I think, would sleep in the backseat of the car.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:43.560]   And my grandfather and my dad and his brother would go and lay out a blanket, lay out a
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.860]   bedroll on the side of the road.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:51.060]   And this is the days of kind of what you think about when you think about Route 66.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.460]   There's no interstate system.
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.980]   There's just a normal two-lane road or a four-lane road.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:14:00.380]   You just pull off the road, roll out your bedroll on the side of the road and go to
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.380]   sleep.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.900]   No tent, no fancy mattress.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.140]   You just roll it out and go to sleep.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.700]   And that's the way that that was normal.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.520]   That was not weird.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.620]   That was relatively normal.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:20.860]   That was the way that a family would travel in those days.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:26.260]   Now today, I would feel a little bit like I was committing like spousal abuse if I told
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.620]   my wife, "Hey, you go sleep in the car and we're just going to park here on the side
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.620]   of the road."
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:33.180]   I'm not – obviously, that's not abuse.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:36.540]   But like I would feel that way because our whole society has changed.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:37.540]   But that's a construct.
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:41.640]   That's a social construct, a social idea.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.700]   And you can change that.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.500]   You could do that today.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.840]   You can carry a tent with you.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.860]   You can find – don't do it on the interstate but you could pull off on some road and walk
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:55.220]   across the ditch and roll out your sleeping bag and your bivy sack underneath the tree.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.140]   You could do it.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:02.220]   I've traveled in some places and some places when I've been out – we were preaching
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.780]   in Asia one time.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:07.020]   And when you're traveling, there's people coming in from all kinds of churches in the
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.500]   local area, coming into the – to nearby.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.900]   Nobody has money for a hotel room.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.660]   Nobody has money for those things.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:15.580]   And so you just lie down on the floor.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.660]   And sometimes there's a bed, sometimes there's not.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.500]   Sometimes there's a foam mat or a bamboo mat, sometimes there's not.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.060]   You just lie down and sleep.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.300]   Now, my bottom gets a little bit sore for a while because I'm out of shape with that
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.300]   kind of approach.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:31.500]   But you do it for a while and you start to recognize, you know what, we can still be
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.500]   resilient.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.860]   So don't let the cost of traveling keep you from traveling if you want to do that.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:42.700]   Don't let the cost of restaurant food keep you from showing your children what the Grand
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.300]   Canyon looks like.
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:51.300]   Load them up in the car, cook on the road, do it cheap, but take them to the Grand Canyon.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:54.180]   That's it.
