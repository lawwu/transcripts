[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.400]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.880]   We hope your Christmas was delightful and Christ-honoring.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm guessing the holiday did not pass
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.300]   without you feeling its cost too.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.320]   Reports say that American adults spend over $900
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.760]   on Christmas gifts each,
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.060]   a total of over $1 trillion shelled out on electronics,
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.820]   video games, clothes, books, jewelry, music, toys,
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.420]   and one of the most beloved gifts of all, gift cards.
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.520]   While it's now thick with those gift cards,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.120]   how do we live contentedly
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.700]   in this overabundant consumer culture?
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.500]   The question is not only on the minds of Americans.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.020]   In fact, today's question arrives from South Wales
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.660]   from a podcast listener named Lauren.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.640]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for your ministry.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.620]   My question is regarding ethical consumerism.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.820]   As a Christian, I wanna live a non-exploitative,
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.800]   Christ-honoring life, and as part of that,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260]   I've recently been making efforts
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.740]   to make lifestyle decisions which are more ethical,
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.900]   such as switching to meat,
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.100]   which does not arise from inhumane or cruel treatment,
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.780]   and buying clothes from sources where workers
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.580]   have received fair treatment.
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.300]   However, having started down this path,
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.340]   I see that it could become all-consuming,
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.780]   using reusable containers,
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.860]   carrying my own takeaway cup everywhere, et cetera,
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.120]   and I also anticipate that it could have
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.900]   a fairly negligible impact as I'm just one person.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.740]   So how do we navigate a life
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.940]   where consumable goods are so abundant?
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.100]   I think Lauren puts her finger on a key issue,
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.220]   even in answer to her own question,
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.860]   on a key issue with the words,
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.740]   "Ethical consumerism could become all-consuming."
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.180]   I don't even know if she meant to make it that clever.
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.620]   Consumerism consumes.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.180]   That would be a great irony, wouldn't it,
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.780]   to be consumed by ethical consuming,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.140]   and what would make it more than an irony,
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.060]   namely a tragedy, is if being consumed
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.020]   we're not just being preoccupied,
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.060]   but actually being eaten and destroyed.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.060]   Now, is that possible?
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.340]   How might we avoid that?
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.300]   'Cause she raises that specter
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   that we might be consumed by ethical consuming.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.220]   Now, in principle, I can't see why any of us
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.220]   should oppose being more discerning about what we consume,
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.860]   discerning about its origin, just or unjust,
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.860]   discerning about its effects, harmful or healthy,
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.460]   discerning about its process of delivery,
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.420]   honest or black market.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.860]   So forming judgments about these things
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.820]   based on truth is a good thing to do.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.660]   So being a discerning consumer
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.180]   rather than an undiscerning one is a good thing.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.820]   Just origins are better than unjust.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.500]   Healthy effects are better than harmful.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.780]   Honest delivery is better than black market.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.020]   But what Lauren is making clear
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.020]   is that discernment takes into account other realities.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.420]   Besides product origins, product effects, product delivery,
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.020]   she points out that the life focus and life effort
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.820]   that go into discerning origins and effects
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.220]   and deliveries of dozens and dozens of products
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.740]   could become so all-consuming
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.040]   that it's totally out of proportion
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.340]   to the amount of good being done
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.220]   and might be doing damage elsewhere.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.820]   In other words, more needs to be discerned
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.740]   than it first meets the eye.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.620]   She asks, how can we navigate such issues?
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.060]   Now, it sounds to me like she already has a good grasp
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.180]   on the main answer to that question,
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.000]   namely, don't let the effort to be discerning
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.420]   about origins, effects, and delivery of goods
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.420]   cloud your discernment about how to be a good steward
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.880]   of your limited life focus and life effort.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.380]   Be discerning about that as well.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.380]   So maybe what I could do is provide a little more food
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.020]   for this bigger discernment to feed on.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.620]   So here are a few tastes of what I have in mind.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.620]   I have often said Christians care about all suffering,
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.660]   especially eternal suffering.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.720]   Christians are people who see that God has warned
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.380]   about eternal suffering for guilty sinners,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.220]   and they have seen that he provided the one way of escape,
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.980]   namely, the death and resurrection of his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.280]   in the place of sinners who trust him.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.220]   That perspective on the world changes everything.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.660]   We care about all suffering,
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.700]   but especially eternal suffering.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   So let's restate that in three ways
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.520]   that make it more obviously relevant
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.820]   for ethical consumerism or ethical consuming.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.620]   One, Christians care about all good deeds,
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.500]   especially the good deeds that are the effect
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.740]   of saving faith and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.980]   In other words, Christians are glad
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.980]   when unbelievers act justly and do what leads to health,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   but we are more glad when justice and health grow
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.820]   in the soil of saving faith by the power of God's Spirit.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.840]   These are the only good deeds
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.580]   that will survive the judgment.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.580]   Second, Christians care about all environmental damage
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.780]   that hurts human beings,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.580]   especially the final burning up of the earth
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.180]   that leaves only the faithful and the works done in faith.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.700]   Second Peter 3:10,
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.260]   "The day of the Lord will come like a thief,
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.620]   and then the heavens will pass away with a roar,
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.180]   and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved,
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.080]   and the earth and the works that are done on it
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.460]   will be found out."
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.700]   In other words, it matters what happens to human beings
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.060]   as an effect of what happens to the planet.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.700]   And Christians know that what is going to happen
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.080]   to the planet is that it will be purged as by fire
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.140]   of all that is unbelieving and ungodly and unrighteous.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.300]   They care about that more than they care
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.700]   about what happens to the earth
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.860]   and the damage it does to human beings now.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.360]   Not that they don't care about that, but more.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.620]   It's a matter of proportion.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.620]   And number three, Christians care about all honest work
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   and that it be properly rewarded everywhere in the world.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.380]   But we care especially about the final reckoning
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.340]   when everyone is rewarded with perfect justice
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.380]   according to our deeds.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.040]   First Peter 1:17,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.900]   "God judges impartially according to each one's deeds.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.340]   So conduct yourselves with fear
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.540]   throughout the time of your exile."
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.540]   We want people now to receive from man
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.420]   what will result in a life of health and longevity.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.580]   But oh, how much more we want for people to receive from God
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.060]   what will result in perfect health and eternal longevity
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.820]   at the end of the age.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.640]   So here's the point I'm making.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.900]   Yes, we need to be discerning about the justice
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.980]   of the origin of consumable goods.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.140]   And yes, we need to be discerning about the health
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.020]   of the effect of the consumable goods.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.420]   And yes, we need to be discerning about honesty
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.500]   and the way goods are delivered.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.920]   But Christians are people who see such things
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   in a much, much, much bigger context
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.860]   than this world sees them and then this world is.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.020]   And we must also be discerning therefore
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.020]   about the proportion of life focus and life effort
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:36.220]   that is allotted to such concerns.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.100]   And I'm suggesting that one of the keys
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.420]   to navigating our way among these concerns
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.980]   is to know the bigger issues
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.340]   and be even more passionate about them
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.780]   than we are about the smaller ones.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.340]   - Very good, Pastor John, thank you.
