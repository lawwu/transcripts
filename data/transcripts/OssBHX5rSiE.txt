[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Pastor John, at the recent Pastors' Conference you gave a mini-theology of
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.200]   prayer, and I was wondering if you could share that here on this episode of
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.680]   Ask Pastor John. What I said at the conference, that I spoke to try to
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.800]   encourage a pastor who had written a question concerning losing hope, losing
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.480]   confidence in prayer, probably because he had seen God do less than he had hoped.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.600]   What I said was, Jesus called us to pray first and foremost that His name would
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.280]   be hallowed, that His kingdom would come, that His will would be done, and then as
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.240]   a support and a means to that, that we'd have our daily bread, and that we'd
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.080]   be protected from the devil, and that we'd be led in paths of righteousness, and so
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.680]   on. And so clearly, at the heart of our prayer life, is to be, "Father, cause your
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   name in this world to be revered, and loved, and praised, and honored, and start
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.200]   right here in my heart this morning. And then advance your kingdom, O God, and
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.080]   cause your will to be done the way the angels do it in heaven." In other words,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.800]   wrap up and bring your kingdom in, and do everything you need to to get us to that
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.400]   goal. And what I said was, in the book of Revelation, prayer is being gathered
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.840]   into bowls. This is seen in chapter 5, it's seen in chapter 8. And those bowls
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.880]   have two functions. They are censors, they're like incense, and in
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.360]   the presence of God, that incense is really pleasing to Him. God loves the
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.000]   aroma of the prayers of His people, which means that if you're on your face crying
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.920]   out for a lost loved one, or for some difficulty in your church, that very act
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.600]   is pleasing to God. It is not wasted. Quite apart from the answer that is
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.680]   going to come now, or ten years from now, or that God's going to just answer in a
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.760]   way totally unexpected, the prayer itself is precious to God. That's the first
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.600]   meaning of those bowls and that incense. The second is in chapter 8,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.900]   there's going to come a day when those bowls are full. In other words, the
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.000]   billions upon billions of prayers that have been prayed, "Hallowed be thy name,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.480]   thy kingdom come." The last one is going to be prayed, and God's going to look at
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.320]   that angel and say, "Pour it out on the earth." And He's going to take the bowl of
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.600]   prayers, like fire, and throw it on the earth, and the final purposes of God are
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.160]   going to be achieved. And I think we need to preach to ourselves that our prayers
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.320]   are part of the causality of the final victory of God. He wouldn't have
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.400]   asked us to pray that His kingdom come if He didn't mean for our prayers to be
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.600]   an instrument in the coming of the kingdom. So it's simply astonishing that
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.000]   when you think of the billions of times the Lord's Prayer has been uttered, all
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.680]   of those times when it's been uttered in faith, God's put it in a bowl there,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.360]   and it's filling up and filling up, and the day's going to come when that
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.560]   bowl, as it were, will be poured out as the consummation of the age. So none of
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.680]   those prayers is wasted. I can't think of a greater motive for prayer than to see
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.520]   this theology behind it. Thank you, Pastor John, for this, and thank you for
