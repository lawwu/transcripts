[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   at the heart of addiction, but also at the heart of a challenged life, challenged in the ways that
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.340]   life shouldn't be challenging, is this lack of distress tolerance. And I have a question about
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.000]   distress tolerance specifically. What can we do to increase our distress tolerance? Like what
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.520]   practices? Maybe we just have to experience distress to know how to navigate distress.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.940]   Well, we're going to experience distress. We experience it all the time. And I think
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.580]   it's, and you may be able to articulate this even better than I can, but, you know, I think we need
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.420]   to look at stress, right? Not all stress is bad. We need stress. We need stress to move around in this
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.860]   chair. I need to be able to walk around. My muscles need to tense and I need that stress.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.680]   Was it Hans Selye's work around eustress and distress? We're going to experience distress.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.860]   And it's not about avoiding distress. It's, you know, how are we going to walk through that distress?
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.860]   And so I like to break practices down into a couple of different ways. So proactive and reactive.
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.620]   Proactive are going to be things that we schedule, you know, I'm going to do, you talked about yoga
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.000]   nidra. We can talk about that a little bit more. You call it a non-sleep, deep rest, other forms of
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.580]   mindfulness and meditation that actually allow us to raise capacity in our, our nervous system.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.120]   going to therapy, coaching, being involved in a community, doing physical exercise. These are
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.160]   things that we're going to schedule going into the cold plunge, which does allow us to experience
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.140]   something and stay a little bit longer. And it gives us, you know, it's so many, it's, we have one at
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.520]   home and when friends come over to use it, it's so funny because I think the first time they're going
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.260]   to do it. And I know you've had a lot of people, we actually, I was at your home a couple of years
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.220]   ago and there was a guy who was doing it for the first time. And he's like a big, I don't remember
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.080]   this, but he's like a big athletic guy. And he, he was freaking out, getting into, terrified. Right.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.140]   And it's just cold water. There's no, it can't, I mean, it could hurt you if you're in there for
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.720]   however long to get hypothermia, but it's not going to hurt you. So having practices like that that allow
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.040]   us to move through that level of fear can translate to fear or distress can translate when it, it comes
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.900]   in real time for something that we, that I know I can walk through this. Yeah. Because adrenaline is
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.300]   ubiquitous in stressful circumstances, which is just a bunch of science nerd speak for the stress
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.700]   response is always an increase in autonomic arousal or alertness, a shrinking of the visual
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.040]   field, an increase in heart rate, a tendency to move. People will say, but I freeze actually the
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.440]   freezing response. This is kind of interesting. My lab studied this. Lindsay Soleil published a paper
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.540]   in nature about this in 2018. She was a graduate student in my lab. The freezing response is an active
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.660]   behavior. Oh yeah. Trying to hide from, from an intruder in your home, in the closet, you're trying not to
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.600]   move. So people think, Oh, you know, people freeze under stress. No, the freezing response is an active
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.460]   response. You know, the adrenaline dump is sometimes called is, is what essentially creates the freeze
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.140]   response. It's why people can't remember things when they get up on stage, if they have a fear of public
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.080]   public speaking. Um, and I was going to, uh, I forgot to mention in the cold plunge, cold water is a highly
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.220]   reliable way to elicit an adrenaline response. Yeah. It's just a great training for this feels
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.120]   uncomfortable. I want to get out, but I'm going to learn to control my thinking in this uncomfortable
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.620]   circumstance. Yeah. So that would fit into the proactive, right? So that's something that you can
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.320]   proactively start to be able to manage that adrenaline as you're, as you're telling me in,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.960]   in the body, right? You're, we're able to manage those feelings because what is it come down to is
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.600]   it's a, it's a, these sensations in our body that we're experiencing that feel really uncomfortable.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.140]   And we might be able to sense them a little earlier. Right. If we have some training, I just want to throw
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.280]   in one little science tidbit, as long as we're talking about using cold as a way to manage, um,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.880]   distress tolerance is that the first 15 to 20 seconds after the adrenaline response hits and it
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.420]   hits very fast, your forebrain, which is involved in all your contextual decision-making and clean,
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.660]   clear strategies of what best to do is essentially shut down for about 20 seconds. If you can make it
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.780]   20 seconds, you have a far better chance of not doing something really stupid and doing something
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.280]   that's very adaptive. Right. Now there may be circumstances where you don't have 20 seconds,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:36.720]   but if under stress and riding out that 20 seconds is, uh, generally going to be a very adaptive
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.780]   approach because then your forebrain comes back, quote unquote, online, and you could really start to
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.780]   make strategic decisions based on those particular circumstances. And so that's, what's happening when
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.220]   we get, uh, experienced, people say get triggered by something that's, uh, uncomfortable for us.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.400]   Right. Uh, you really, uh, you, you, you get a text message from your boss or your partner that says,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.740]   we need to talk later. Right. A lot of people, I don't know about you, but when I get, we need to talk
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.720]   later, it's not my favorite text in the world to get. Right. So someone might get that text and then
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.520]   they immediately go into like their perception or their beliefs or their kind of narrative about what that
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.020]   means. I'm going to be rejected. This is going to be disappointing. It's going to be really hard.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.920]   And those perceptions or beliefs are coming out of their past. So now sitting there looking at a text
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.400]   message, which is really just a, a neutral it's, it's all events are neutral. We bring the meaning
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   to them and we want to bring meaning to them, but it's just words on a, a screen. And we don't even
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.880]   know what it means yet. You're looking at those and you're not even in the present that more you're
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.480]   in the past. And we're never really out of the present. People say, get present.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.100]   That's the only place we live. It's what, where are we oriented?
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.580]   Past, present, or future.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.020]   Yeah. Right. In this moment, now that I'm going into this narrative from all the other times that
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.640]   I was, let's say I'm making up that I'm being rejected or I'm not going to get what I want.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.960]   Now I'm oriented to the past. So I'm, we could say I'm disoriented in that moment.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.060]   Or to the future, you're anticipating what might be said, what's going to happen.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.480]   You're out of the moment.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.400]   But I would say that the anticipation is still something that's coming out of what we've experienced
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.680]   before. Right. And then from there we go into an automatic reaction and it's like a fight
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.580]   or flight response. It might not seem like that because we don't, we might not be thinking I'm
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.400]   going to die from this, but if, you know, we might be thinking I'm not going to be okay.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.960]   And what is, I'm not going to be okay. That gets carried out and it's triggered in the body.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.080]   I would say in the same way as I'm at threat. I'm at, I'm in danger. And this is where we're
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.380]   confusing discomfort. Cause even if I am going to be not going to get the answer I want, or I'm going
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.720]   to be abandoned, it's not life threatening. It's not actually threatening. It's the, it's perceived
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.960]   threat, but I respond to that perceived threat as if it's actual threat. And I might respond by
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.280]   kind of going after the person, like I need to know right now being obsessive about it. I might
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.440]   respond by withdrawing completely and, and, and hiding from it, but it, it, it creates this cycle
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:14.240]   of kind of, uh, uh, uh, an automatic reaction to things that doesn't allow me to build tolerance
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.240]   for that, that stressor, right? The, the solution to that is first be aware that that's,
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.320]   that's happening. And once you're aware that that happens and it happens to us all the time,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:32.120]   once I recognize that I'm in this cycle below to, to, to find a way to stop, to intervene on that,
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.600]   to take a break from it, it might be just those 20 seconds. It might be something that, uh, it might
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.320]   be taking a few breaths. It might be walking away from it. Can I interject something there? Because
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.800]   one thing that stemmed out of a prior conversation we had is I think, you know, these aspirational,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.920]   um, responses of, okay, like the, the stressor hits, I'm going to take a pause. I'm going to create the
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.580]   gap between stimulus and response that, you know, was it Viktor Frankl or something like that referred
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.780]   to? It sounds wonderful, but in real time, everything's very hard. It's very, everything's
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.640]   different. And so, uh, you know, what can we do to prepare? What are the things I like this notion of
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.300]   proactive tools that, that we can schedule, um, cold plunge being one of them. We'll talk about yoga,
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:23.060]   nidra and some other things, but, um, but one of the things that I've learned is that there are
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.960]   sensations in the body that come about and it will be different for different people, but there are
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.200]   sensations in my body that come about very fast because the adrenaline response is fast. And the
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.080]   more that I pay attention to those, the more I'm able to pick up on them at, at earlier stages of the,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.040]   the stress response, kind of like seeing a big wave coming from further out. And the, the yogis
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.500]   talked about this. I learned about this also from you that like to, in meditation, we can start to
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.500]   see the quote, it's mystical language, but that like the subtle ripples of our perception. Whereas when
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.100]   we're going through life and we're just kind of around, it's like being on a train and we're just
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.900]   seeing stuff go by all the time. I think that the concept is, is stilling leads to seeing.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.740]   I love that. The more that we can still the mind, the easier we can see what's actually happening
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:18.880]   versus what we perceive as happening. So what you say is so true that it is hard. If the first step is
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.080]   to, to, after we recognize that this is something that happening is to stop when we're in the middle
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:30.540]   of response. How do we stop? Um, something that I work with the people and I actually heard you talk
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.340]   about in a, in a different way that I really appreciated in, uh, one of your essentials podcasts
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.820]   where, you know, in that moment, when we're in that reaction, you know, the, the, the, the sympathetic
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.760]   nervous system has been activated. The solution though, is not to deactivate the sympathetic. It's
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:57.200]   to activate the parasympathetic. So our practices and tools that I think are the most beneficial is
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:05.020]   how do we activate the parasympathetic? A great question to ask ourselves once we recognize that
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:12.940]   we're in some sort of stress response, I like to tell people to ask is, am I, or is anybody around me
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.320]   in immediate physical danger? And if the answer is no, first off, if I can ask that question,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.740]   it's probably the answer is no, but most of the things that we experience every day are
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.760]   not life-threatening. Actually, probably the thing that we experience every day that's most
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.900]   life-threatening, that doesn't bother most of us is driving in a car, right? And we were hurtling
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:37.860]   down the road and just trusting that someone's not going to cross over that other line, but that
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.940]   won't scare us. But, you know, uh, getting someone that you're in a, uh, a committed relationship
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.040]   with or that you're emotionally attached to that says something you don't like might throw you into
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.520]   a spiral. I mean, it speaks to the unbelievably powerful aspect of, of human connection. Yeah.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   I mean, likewise with the earlier example of the kid in video games, we think about this kid
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:08.300]   and the video game as like the, the only players in the interaction, but to take a video game away
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.680]   from a kid is to also remove him from his social context. We know that social isolation is one of
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.920]   the most, um, potent stressors for, for any mammal, especially humans.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.580]   I mean, from what I've read in, you know, tribes would basically shame someone out of it. If
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.920]   they did something really terrible, you know, they would send them out of the tribe and that was like
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:35.280]   death, you know, they only survive together. Now we can live alone because of, you know, technology
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:42.540]   and human advancement, but like serve, like live physically alone, but you know, we're not at the
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.540]   top of the food chain, really. You know, if we were out in the, in the jungle or back when we were,
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:53.880]   uh, nomadic and we still have that within us that we need that connection. We need that.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   Thank you.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.940]   you
