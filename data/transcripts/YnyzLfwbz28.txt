[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   I remember coming across this presentation that had been given by Washington Mutual,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.400]   where they were, which was one of the big lenders at the time, no longer exists.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.580]   And they were trying to get people to take out, it was a whole internal
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.060]   presentation about how you got someone to take out a risky mortgage when what they
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.760]   really wanted was the same 30 year fixed rate mortgage that their, that their
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.780]   parents had had, and it was all the tactics and tips you could use to twist
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.600]   their arm to take out this, this riskier mortgage, because those are the ones that
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.820]   were in demand to be packaged up into subprime mortgage backed securities.
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.100]   And so Walmart could turn around and sell those mortgages for more money to Wall
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.480]   Street than they could the fake 30 year fixed rate mortgages.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.040]   And then I remember thinking, there's just something wrong with a world where all of
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.320]   the responsibility is on consumers to understand, and none of the responsibility
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.360]   is on the people selling the product.
