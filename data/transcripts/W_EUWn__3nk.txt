[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.680]   - Well, is holiness the fight against sin
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.760]   or is holiness the fight for joy in God?
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.880]   It's a very good question from a listener named Kendall.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.800]   Hello, Pastor John, a group of guys and myself
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.120]   have been reading through your book, "Desiring God."
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.360]   Awesome book, thank you for it.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.280]   My question in overcoming sin and temptation,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.600]   the strategy most of us attempt to employ
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.480]   is to fight it, overcome it, outpower it and outwill it.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.360]   But after reading the first few chapters of your book,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.880]   I'm wondering if our job as Christians
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240]   is not to fight against something,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.920]   but to fight for something else,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.720]   namely joy and pleasure in God.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.760]   My heart was created to be pleased,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.920]   so when I fight against sin,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.560]   am I unwittingly fighting against my own nature
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.740]   to find pleasure?
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.840]   I understand that sin offers a certain level
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.140]   of satisfaction and pleasure,
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.040]   so to fight against it with no better satisfaction in view
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.080]   is to deny my own humanity,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.000]   but to fight for pleasure in God
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.360]   as a means of overcoming sin and temptation
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.200]   affirms my desire to be pleased
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.760]   and reorients my desire to its proper place.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.720]   So should we fight against sin
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.000]   or instead should we fight for pleasure in God,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.400]   which will in turn kill our sin?
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.160]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Kendall?
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.160]   - Maybe the most important thing to say to Kendall is this,
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.760]   put every question like that through the sieve of the Bible.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.280]   When you pose an either or question,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   be sure to ask, does the Bible treat these as either or?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   So the last way he asked the question I think was,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.960]   should we fight against sin
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   or instead should we fight for pleasure in God,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.320]   which will in turn kill our sin?
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.680]   So if you walk into a question assuming an either or
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.600]   like that, when it's a both and,
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.100]   you will force the Bible to say what it doesn't wanna say.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.840]   So in this sense, I want to say as clearly as I can,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.140]   the Bible does not say we should choose
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.300]   between fighting against sin
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.840]   and fighting for pleasure in God.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   What it says loud and clear and scary forceful
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   is that we should with all our might fight against sin,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.320]   like cut off your hands and gouge out your eyes
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.160]   if you have to, to not sin,
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.560]   in order that we might kill the very thing
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.480]   that prevents us from having pleasure in God.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.800]   So instead of asking, should we fight against sin
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.240]   or should we fight for pleasure in God?
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.040]   I think we should ask, how do we go about fighting
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.240]   against sin so that the outcome is a deep
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.000]   and lasting pleasure in God
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.440]   and then avoids sin without such a battle?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.360]   So just to make clear from the Bible,
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.760]   my strong emphasis on the negative side
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.480]   of fighting against sin, consider these texts,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.840]   Colossians 3, 5, "Put to death therefore
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.800]   what is earthly in you, sexual immorality,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.780]   impurity, passion."
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.360]   Romans 8, 13, "If you live according to the flesh,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.540]   you will die, but if by the spirit you put to death
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.200]   the deeds of the body, you will live."
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   Or 1 Corinthians 9, 26, "I don't run aimlessly.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.960]   I do not box as one beating the air,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.240]   but I discipline my body.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.420]   I pommel my body, keep it under control,
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.840]   lest after preaching to others,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.400]   I myself should be disqualified."
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.160]   Ephesians 4, 22, "Put off your old self."
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.740]   Titus 2, 11, "The grace of God has appeared,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.960]   bringing salvation for all people,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.800]   training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions."
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.680]   Romans 6, 13, "Do not present your members to sin
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.240]   as instruments of unrighteousness."
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.160]   Matthew 5, 29, "If your right eye causes you to sin,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.440]   tear it out and throw it away.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.540]   Better that you lose one of your members
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.400]   than that your whole body be thrown into hell."
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   So there's no question that we should fight against sin.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.320]   And this is surely part of what Jesus meant
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.020]   when he said, "Deny yourself, take up your cross
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.520]   and follow me."
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   But, Kendall is absolutely right in pointing out
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.080]   that this negative battle will never suffice
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.120]   in the pursuit of holiness and godliness and Christ-likeness
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.400]   and a life of sacrificial love.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.560]   Jesus pointed out that if you drive out a demon
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.240]   and leave the house swept and cleaned,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.420]   seven more demons are gonna come home.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.600]   Negative struggles never suffice
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.200]   to provide power for godliness.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.280]   And C.S. Lewis threw this door open for me
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.960]   50 years ago with this quote.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.360]   Very familiar for anybody who's read "Desiring God."
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.760]   "The New Testament has lots to say about self-denial,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.600]   but not about self-denial as an end in itself.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.780]   We're told to deny ourselves and take up our crosses
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.520]   in order that we may follow Christ.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.280]   And nearly every description of what we shall ultimately
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.800]   find when we do so contains an appeal to desire.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.400]   Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.520]   and the staggering nature of the rewards promised
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.400]   in the gospels, it would seem that our Lord
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   finds our desires not too strong, but too weak.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.000]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.600]   and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.880]   like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.800]   in the slum when he cannot imagine what is meant
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.960]   by the offer of a holiday at the sea.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.400]   We are far too easily pleased."
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   In other words, telling ourselves no when tempted by sin
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.880]   is simply one strategy of making possible
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.960]   for our souls to feel what a holiday at the sea
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.880]   is like spiritually.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.880]   If Jesus offers himself to us as a all-satisfying treasure,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.920]   and between us and Jesus, the devil is presenting himself
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.720]   to us as an angel of all-satisfying light,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.080]   well, we need to run him through with the sword
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.600]   of the Spirit and kill the temptation,
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   not as an end in itself, but so that we have access
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.200]   to Jesus who is all-satisfying.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.000]   Here's the way Paul put it in Philippians 3, 7.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.640]   "Whatever gain I counted as loss, whatever gain I had,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.600]   I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.120]   Indeed, I count everything as loss
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.480]   because of the surpassing value
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.400]   of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord."
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.080]   And here's the way Jesus put it when he talked
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.320]   about self-denial in relationship to the kingdom.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.640]   It says, Matthew 13, 44, "The kingdom of heaven
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.760]   is like a treasure hidden in a field
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.440]   which a man found and covered up,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   and then in his joy, he goes and sells all that he has."
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.600]   Now that's self-denial, right?
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.480]   You sell all that you have and buys that field.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.520]   So in the end, such a deal, right?
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.240]   You sell all that you have, which looks like self-denial
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.480]   to the world, and you gain the kingdom of heaven
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   and everlasting, eternal, supreme joy, such a transaction.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.520]   We can joyfully sell everything
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.440]   because of the value of Christ.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.480]   One more example because of what love really is
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.800]   in Hebrews 10, 34.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.960]   "You had compassion on those in prison,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.640]   and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.960]   since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.360]   and an abiding one."
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.120]   So the reason they could joyfully accept
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.560]   the plundering of their property, that's self-denial,
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   that's loss, that's the willingness to sacrifice,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.920]   is because they felt a superior value
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.760]   of what they had in Christ,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.960]   which means the main battle for love
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.920]   is a battle, like Kendall says,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   a battle for falling in love with the treasure given by God
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.800]   and which is God.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   So yes, many times we will meet the enemy of temptation
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.000]   with the resounding, "No, get out of my life.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.440]   You can't have me."
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.720]   And we will do that first
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   because we've tasted the superior value of Jesus.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.560]   And because we want more of Jesus.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.440]   Amen, self-denial in service to our eternal pursuit
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.280]   of more and more joy in Jesus.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.120]   This is brilliant.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.520]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.640]   Podcast listeners out there,

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.240]   The book is titled "Desiring God,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.760]   Meditations of a Christian Hedonist."
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.120]   It's available at Amazon

[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.040]   It is a really good question.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.520]   It's a fascinating story.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.280]   And we're gonna hear the 10 stages
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.340]   or the 10 steps of that story
