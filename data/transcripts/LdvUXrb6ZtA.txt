[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   your second and third trip to a destination
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.560]   is always better than the first
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.920]   because you get to experience
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.120]   and understand a place a bit deeper.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.000]   And as much as I'm always thinking,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.580]   oh, I would love to travel to a new place,
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.760]   I wanna see something new,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.880]   that is an exciting part of travel.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.200]   But there are a few countries like Japan and France
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.960]   where we've gone back over and over again.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.060]   I can't explain how awesome it is to go back
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.280]   to see a place where you don't feel the pressure
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.400]   of needing to check off all these options
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.720]   of places that you have to see,
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.000]   these must-see destinations,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.220]   and you can just really immerse yourself in the place,
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.120]   get lost roaming the streets,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.580]   stop for a meal that you weren't planning on.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.200]   It just makes every trip awesome.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.720]   And I think the exciting thing is
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.460]   I'm starting to reframe my mind
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.960]   that you can just do that anywhere.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.200]   It's okay to go to a country
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.700]   and not see all the marquee destinations.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.900]   You can always go back.
