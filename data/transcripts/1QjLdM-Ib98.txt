[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   How should we respond when we are unappreciated?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's a question that we all face. We all want to excel. We all want
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   to be noticed. We all want to be thanked.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   We all want our efforts to be valued. It's only natural.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And instead of telling us to get used to not being appreciated, to get
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   used to being unappreciated, God actually gives us some
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   incredible promises that we are being appreciated in
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   ways we may have never, ever expected. Here's
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Pastor John preaching way back in 1991 to explain.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Let me close with two illustrations of how this
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   works out in situations. Two kinds of situations. First,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   the hurt that you experience
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   when the good you do is not noticed or appreciated.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   The hurt that you experience when the good that you do is not noticed
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   or appreciated. Parents who never say
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   or said, "Good job."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   No matter how hard the kid tried, never said it.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   "Good job." It's the black hole
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   of parenthood. Children who never
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   thank mom for thousands of meals
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and rides and launderings never say a word.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   How does a mom survive?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Husbands and wives who long ago stopped saying to each other
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   eyeball to eyeball, "I love you.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I'm so glad I married you.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Thanks for all you do." Just a black
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   hole. Nobody notices.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Nobody says anything. You know what the answer
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   to that is? God. God is the answer.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Listen to this. Matthew 6, 4, Jesus says,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   "Your father who sees in secret
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   will reward you." It's a God issue.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It's a God issue. It's a God issue. It's a God
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   issue. That's the way you'll survive when every
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   effort of love disappears in a black hole.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's a God issue that will keep you smiling. It's a God issue
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   that will keep you hopeful and happy and resourceful and flowing and
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   flowing and flowing to the day you die when nobody says thank you.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's a God issue. You can bring more glory
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   to your God by pressing on in thankless
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   love than you can by any other means.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It's a God issue. That's why I said mindful of God
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   in verse 19 is the most important phrase in the book. Conscious of
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   God. Are we conscious of God? So often
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I find myself not even thinking about God when I get angry
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   at somebody. Of course I'm going to get angry. I've got
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   no resources. It's me and them and justice to be done. God's
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   gone. He's out of the world. And I'm
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   just pleading with you to figure God back into the equation this morning
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and to figure him first on this illustration as the one who
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   sees in secret and rewards you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Mark this now. We're sinners, okay? No problem.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   We're sinners. We do lots of bad things. They will be covered in the cross.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   But we do lots of good things. The Bible says God is not so unjust
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   as to overlook your good deeds. Hebrews chapter 6.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You do good things. Everybody in this room does good things if you're a believer.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   God writes down every one of them in
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   his book. Every single one
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   is kept in a book. It doesn't matter if nobody else
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   in the world, children, spouses, parents,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   grandparents, colleagues, friends, roommates
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   never say a word. God writes it down. And therefore you
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   can go to your room, get down on your knees and say,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   "Father, of all the audiences in the world that I would like
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   to have, you're the most important.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And I want to thank you that you noticed and that
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   you approved. And I love you and I need
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   you and I trust you.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And would you grant me the grace now to be free
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   from self-pity and move on
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and love?" God is the answer, folks. God
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   is the answer. One last illustration. Namely, the hurt that you
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   experience, not so much when you are ignored
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   or the good that you do disappears into a black hole,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   but when the good that you do comes back in your face.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's twisted. It's persecuted.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Someone lies about you at work and you lose your job
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   and it's totally unjust.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Totally unjust. Or you confide in someone and
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   bare your soul and
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   they turn it against you. They reject you.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Or for the first time in your life,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   prayerfully, meekly, you sit down in front
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   of an abortion mill
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   in Fargo and you get thrown in the Bismarck State
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Penitentiary for nine months as a Bethel College student.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That's where Karen Sorensen is. Or David Buck.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He's in jail right now in Wichita.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   How do you survive and go on
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   loving people when your deep judicial sense says
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   "No! It isn't right! This can't be tolerated.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   It's not fair." And the answer
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   is God. Romans 12
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "Beloved, do not avenge yourselves,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   but give place to wrath,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I will repay,' says the Lord. If your enemy
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   is hungry, you feed him, and if your enemy is thirsty, you give him drink."
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Don't you swear at him. Don't you kick him.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Don't you write nasty letters about him. You love him. Bless him.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Pray for him. And I will be the avenger.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's a God issue. Do you trust God? Do you trust God with the justice
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   of your life? You do what Jesus did.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   He handed over to him who judges justly. Nothing escapes God's notice.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Nothing falls from his memory. He settles accounts with
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   absolute justice, and so we can lay it down. So here's what it all boils down to
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and I close. Remember God.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I just can't say it any more simply. Remember God.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Remember God. Be conscious
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   of God. Trust God. God will reward
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   you for all the right things that you have done when nobody else knows
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   them, and God will avenge you for all the wrong that has
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   been done to you when nobody else knows them.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   So that now, if you believe this God, if he's real to you, if you are conscious
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   of him, if you bank on him, then you can be done with self-pity.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And I just invite you, I plead with you, leave the yoke and the burden
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   of life-ruining self-pity on these benches when you
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   walk out this morning. Self-pity ruins
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   life. You can't see anything. You can't see beauty.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You can't see people. You can't do anything wholesome or feel
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   large feelings. Nothing noble comes out of your life. You're just
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   groveling down there, getting right, getting even. So just
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   leave that on the bench when you leave, because God will reward you
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   for everything you've ever done good when nobody else has noticed.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And it's going to be good. You'll wonder at that day, "Why did I ever feel sorry
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   for myself?" And the second is, God sees
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   every wrong that's ever been done to you, and he will either
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   forgive that by crushing
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   his son for it, in which case you surely wouldn't want to
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   take it into your own hands and say, "I can do better than Jesus did when he bled
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   for that sin. I can vindicate myself better than Jesus vindicated
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   me by dying." You would never want to say that. Or, if
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   the person does not believe, he will put them in hell, and they
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   will burn forever and ever and ever
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   for the sin against you. And you would not want to
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   take that into your hand either. It's going to be settled,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   folks, and you can lay on the bench as you leave this morning
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   the yoke of self-pity and the yoke of bitterness and
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   vengeance and walk out of here free men and free women and
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   free children. So, so good. I love that clip from
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   John Piper's sermon on August 25th, 1991, a sermon
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   titled, "He trusted to him who judges justly."
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   "He trusted to him who judges justly." You can find that entire
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   sermon right now at Zyringa.org. Well, do you have a favorite
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   sermon clip from Pastor John's pulpit ministry? I'm sure you
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   do. Most of you do. Send it to me. I want to hear it. Give me the
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   sermon title. Give me the timestamps from the audio of when the clip begins and ends.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Tell me why it's impacted you. And give me your name and the closest city
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   to you. Email me all of that information at askpastorjohn@zyringa.org.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   It's an email address. Askpastorjohn@zyringa.org.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line for me. It'll be easier for me to
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   find. We are always interested to hear your
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   favorite clips from the pulpit ministry of John Piper. Maybe we can share
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   here with the whole audience. Well, do each of my
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   sins cost me an eternal reward?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Are we caught in a race to outweigh our sins by our good deeds
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   in order to preserve any level of rewards in
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   heaven that we will enjoy in eternity? That's a really
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   good question. It's the next question on the table up on Friday.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   [no audio]
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   [no audio]
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.060]   you
