[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.680]   - Do you think there's intelligent life,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.740]   however you would like to define intelligent life,
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.820]   out there in the universe?
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.540]   - My guess is that there is not intelligent life
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.740]   in the observable universe other than us.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.240]   Simply on the basis of the fact that
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.220]   the likely number of other intelligent species
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.800]   in the observable universe, there's two likely numbers,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.400]   zero or billions. (laughs)
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.480]   And if there had been billions,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.040]   you would have noticed already.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.240]   For there to be literally like a small number,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.920]   like, you know, Star Trek, there's, you know,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.200]   a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.240]   but not a billion, that's weird.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.400]   That's sort of bizarre to me.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.920]   It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.540]   because there's just a big bottleneck
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.900]   to making multicellular life
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.960]   or technological life or whatever.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.480]   It's very hard for me to imagine
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.080]   that there's a whole bunch out there
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.200]   that have somehow remained hidden from us.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800]   - The question I'd like to ask is,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.760]   what would intelligent life look like?
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.040]   What I mean by that question and where it's going is,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.840]   what if intelligent life is just fundamentalist,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.720]   is in some very big ways different
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.400]   than the one that has on Earth?
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.820]   That there's all kinds of intelligent life
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.340]   that operates in different scales
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.220]   of both size and temporal.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.220]   - Right, that's a great possibility
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.700]   because I think we should be humble
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.560]   about what intelligence is, what life is.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.940]   We don't even agree on what life is,
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.940]   much less what intelligent life is, right?
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.900]   So that's an argument for humility,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.780]   saying there could be intelligent life
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.540]   of a very different character, right?
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.980]   Like you could imagine that dolphins are intelligent
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.420]   but never invent space travel
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.400]   'cause they live in the ocean
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.140]   and they don't have thumbs, right?
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.300]   So they never invent technology,
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.740]   they never invent smelting.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.940]   Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.020]   that just don't make technology, right?
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.260]   That's compatible with the data, I think.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.760]   And I think maybe what you're pointing at
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.340]   is even more out there versions of intelligence.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.500]   Intelligence in intermolecular clouds
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.340]   or on the surface of a neutron star
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.700]   or in between the galaxies in giant things
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.540]   where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.940]   On the one hand, yes, we should be very open-minded
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.780]   about those things.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.780]   On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.140]   There might be something about the laws of physics,
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.260]   even though we don't currently know
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.820]   exactly what that thing would be,
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.820]   that makes meters and years
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.820]   the right length and time scales for intelligent life.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.120]   Maybe not, but we're made of atoms,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.300]   atoms have a certain size, we orbit stars,
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.160]   stars have a certain lifetime.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.180]   It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.080]   for intelligent life that we find ourselves in.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.660]   So I'm open-minded in either way.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.180]   I'm open-minded either being humble
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.980]   and there's all sorts of different kinds of life
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.180]   or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.980]   why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.220]   - Yeah, I'm of two minds too,
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.100]   but I often wonder if our brains is just designed
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.100]   to quite obviously to operate and see the world
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.260]   in these time scales and we're almost blind
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.860]   and the tools we've created for detecting things
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.340]   are blind to the kind of observation
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.820]   needed to see intelligent life at other scales.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940]   - Well, I'm totally open to that,
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.980]   but so here's another argument I would make.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.460]   You know, we have looked for intelligent life,
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.740]   but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can,
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.540]   right, by turning radio telescopes to the sky.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.980]   And why in the world would a super advanced civilization
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.940]   randomly beam out radio signals wastefully
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.340]   in all directions into the universe?
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.220]   That just doesn't make any sense,
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.020]   especially because in order to think
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.940]   that you would actually contact another civilization,
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.740]   you would have to do it forever.
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.760]   You'd have to keep doing it for millions of years.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.220]   That sounds like a waste of resources.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.060]   If you thought that there were other solar systems
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.940]   with planets around them where maybe intelligent life
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.540]   didn't yet exist but might someday,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.300]   you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves.
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.500]   You would send a spacecraft out there
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.460]   and you would park it around there
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.300]   and it would be like, from our point of view,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.620]   it would be like 2001 where there's a monolith.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.460]   - Monolith.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.280]   - So there could be an artifact.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.380]   In fact, the other way works also, right?
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.260]   There could be artifacts in our solar system
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.340]   that have been put there
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.180]   by other technologically advanced civilizations
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.540]   and that's how we will eventually contact them.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.100]   We just haven't explored the solar system
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.600]   well enough yet to find them.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.900]   The reason why we don't think about that
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.460]   is 'cause we're young and impatient, right?
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.900]   Like it would take more than my lifetime
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.020]   to actually send something to another star system
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.700]   and wait for it and then come back.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.140]   So but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands of years
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.620]   or million year timescales,
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.460]   that's clearly the right thing to do.
