[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the Gospel according to Saint John,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   in the fourth chapter, reading verses 13 and 14.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again;
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst;
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   We are considering together this great and wonderful statement made by our blessed Lord and Savior to the woman of Samaria.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   He is holding before her the great blessing of the Christian Gospel.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   He is telling her the real reason why he ever came into this world.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   He has already said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Here it is, and this is the position still, that the Son of God has come into the world and lived and died and risen again,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and done all that he did in order that we might have this great blessing of this living water.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And yet the world, like the woman of Samaria, is still in need.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Our Lord, you notice, goes so far as to say this,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   that whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   That's what we are examining at the moment. The all-sufficiency of this great salvation
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   shall never, no never, as long as the world stands, thirst again.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   That is the great claim, and what we are doing is to examine this claim.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Now it's very important that we should realize that this is the claim that is made by the Christian faith,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   that it gives us a full salvation, a complete salvation,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   that it is something that satisfies us entirely and completely.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It couldn't be put plainer than it is put here by our Lord, and especially as he contrasts it
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   with the inability of the world to do this for us.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Whosoever drinketh of this water, he says, pointing to the well, shall thirst again.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That is the well. It never can satisfy.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   But he, in utter contradistinction, claims to satisfy completely.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Now we are considering this, and we started with the mind and the intellect and the understanding.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   For if the gospel doesn't satisfy us completely there, well then the claim has failed and has fallen.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But we have seen that it does give us a complete and entire intellectual satisfaction
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   in a way that nothing else in the world can do this morning.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It isn't that we understand everything fully, but that we are given the understanding
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   which enables us to understand that there are some things beyond our understanding.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And that's one of the most wonderful things a man can ever discover.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   One of the greatest gifts of the Spirit is the gift of humility.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   The trouble with the world is that it's proud and arrogant
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   that little men claims that he can understand God
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and understand what Thomas Carlyle called infinities and immensities.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   That is men's old trouble. That's his folly, that he doesn't know his smallness, his own limits.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And he tries to understand what is inscrutable, what eludes the whole wisdom of the world put together.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   But the Christian is given that understanding, and he draws this distinction
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   between the things that have been revealed and the things that have not been revealed.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And thus he finds himself fully satisfied.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   But now we've moved on to consider the second aspect of this satisfaction.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And that is the satisfaction that is given to the heart, to the sensibilities, to the feelings.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And what we did last Sunday morning was to introduce this subject.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And I felt it was essential that we should demonstrate the importance of this aspect
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and the need of emphasizing this side also.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I was trying to show how, again, a part of the modern confusion is
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   that people are muddled in their thinking as to the place of feeling and of emotion,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   not only in the life of men in general, but also, and in particular,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   in connection with the Christian faith.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And I showed how some make too much of feelings and others make too little of feelings.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And especially we were concerned to show how so much of the tragedy of the modern world
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   is due to this inability to know the exact place of the emotions.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And I tried to show how all this drug-taking and other things today is,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   but a manifestation of a starved emotional condition,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   as is much of the violence that is becoming increasingly evident,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and the whole pleasure mania.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Man has gone wrong in his views of himself.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Modern men, men of this century, in his intellectual arrogance,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   have tended to think of himself as just an intellect,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   and have discounted the feelings and the emotions.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And we consider the various ways in which that has been done.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And thus, the world today is less capable than ever, perhaps,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   of dealing with the emotional and feeling side of our makeup as human beings,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and especially as Christian people.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   However, our Lord claims that he can deal with this also.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And this is the most important thing for us to emphasize.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   There is nothing, it seems to me, more wonderful and more glorious about this gospel
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   than the way in which it deals with the whole man.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Everything else is partial.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Everything else deals with us in bits and portions and parts.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   There is nothing that deals with the whole personality in the way that this gospel does.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And this, I say, is its special glory.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   We can put this, if you like, in terms of balance.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   There is nothing more remarkable, and to me nothing more fascinating,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   than the extraordinary balance of the scriptures.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We are all so unbalanced.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   We are creatures of extremes.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   We swing violently from one side to another.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I could give you many illustrations of that.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The most obvious example in this century is the attitude of mankind to the late Sir Winston Churchill.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Vilified for so many years before the war.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Regarded as a dangerous man and a warmonger.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   After that and up to the present time, almost regarded as a superhuman being, almost a god.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   This is the kind of thing that you get in the world, this violent change from one to another.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   We never continue in one stay.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And therefore there is nothing more marvelous than the gospel and its perfect balance.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Another way perhaps we could look at this is to put it like this.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   The Christian man as depicted in the New Testament never strikes attitudes.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Now that's what the natural man is constantly doing.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Striking attitudes, posing, taking up positions.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   The Christian man never does that at all because he's got this fundamental balance.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   There is this wholeness which is always so true of him.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   He never needs to strike attitudes.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Or another way of putting it is to say that the Christian man never follows fashions.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Everybody else does.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And in every respect, fashions and changes in fashions are not confined to clothing.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   They're quite as amusing in the realm of the intellect.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And as one looks back across life, there's nothing which is really so funny as to see the crazes that have come,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and the fashions in movements, and the emphases, the excitement of the time.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And they're now long since forgotten.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And people under the age of thirty know nothing about them.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   You've got it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It is typical of men, of course, it is an expression of his lack of satisfaction.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He's always looking for something that really is going to give him the satisfaction that he longs for.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And he thinks he's got it, and he's all out for this.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   This is the craze, and everybody's after it.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   But it doesn't satisfy him.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So he takes up something else.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And thus, civilization has been doing this very thing for many, many centuries.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And is as far away today from a final satisfaction as it has ever been.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Well, now, what I'm saying is that the man who conforms to this New Testament picture
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   is never a man who follows fashions.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   He never gets excited about some new emphasis or some new teaching.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That's always a characteristic of an unstable person, and a person who is not rarely satisfied.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It shows that there is a lack there somewhere.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And they think, "Ah, here it is. Off they go after this."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And then, as I say, you'll find them doing perhaps the exact opposite at some later period.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And showing this imbalance, which is always characteristic of those
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   who have never drunk deeply of this water that the Lord Jesus Christ offers us.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   This eternal life which he gives us, and which satisfies the whole of the personality.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Well, now, this to me, therefore, is a most important matter.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It must be a most important matter.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Because we are meant to enjoy this.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And it is only as we do so that we shall be able to help others.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   If we are the victims of the crazies and the fashions, and the changes and the striking of attitudes,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   well, we won't be able to help other people.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   But if they see that we are always balanced and equitable,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   always in a position of pious, well, then they know that they can safely come to us and consult us,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and bring their problems and their questions to us.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And this has been the characteristic of God's people throughout the running centuries.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Now, the question that we must address ourselves to, especially this morning, is this.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   How does our Lord himself and his teaching deal with us in this matter of the emotions?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   What is the place of emotion in the Christian life?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I believe it is one of the most urgent questions confronting us at the present time.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's been the case many times before.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   There's nothing more fascinating in the history of the Church than to trace just this very point,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and to see how the Church has gone into error through going always to some extreme or another,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and failing to maintain this balance.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So let me put it to you like this.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   The first thing we have to realize is that a mere ascent to the truth,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   or the adoption of certain principles and teaching, does not make us Christian.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Now, the mistake, I think, comes in in this way,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   that people sometimes imagine that to adopt or to agree to certain principles of teaching,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and then to show great keenness in connection with them, makes us Christian.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   But it doesn't.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   This is, after all, one of the great differences between the cults and the Christian faith.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Now, that's exactly what happens in the case of the devotees of the cults.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   They take up the teaching, and you are aware, we see a lot of it at the present time,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   of their keenness and their zeal and their enthusiasm.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   But that is, in a sense, where they betray themselves.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   They live on this keenness and this enthusiasm and this zeal.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   They've taken up a teaching, it's a limited one,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   they learn it like parrots and repeat it like parrots,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and they keep themselves going with this artifact, this artificial enthusiasm and keenness,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and persuade themselves that they're very happy and that they've got everything.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   The whole time, if you examine them carefully, you notice that there is a fundamental lack of rest
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   and of ease and of pious, because it is the enthusiasm that keeps them going.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   The moment they stop, they seem to have nothing.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Now, that's different from the Christian position.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Or let me put it to you like this.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   There is another grave danger of confusing the true Christian position
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   with what I would call "believism plus sentimentality."
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Now, what do I mean by that? Well, I mean something like this.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   That you find people who have gone through some form of belief.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   They've heard a message and they've told that if they believe this and accept it,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   that all is well, and they've done so.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   They haven't felt anything at all.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   They've been told, "Believe, and there it is."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And they have believed, and they're told, "All right, you've got it, you're all right."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And yet, you see, they have a feeling that somehow or another they should have felt something,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   but they haven't felt anything.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   So what they do now is this.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   They've got this believism, then they add on to that sentimentality.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   This is something that they add on and produce themselves.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   They have to do so.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   What they have believed has not moved them.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   They haven't felt anything as a result of believing.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   But in order to satisfy this innate desire for some satisfaction in the realm of emotion,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   this has to be added on, this has to be produced, it has to be manufactured.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And there are many ways in which that can be done.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Sometimes the preacher does it, or the evangelist.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And he does it by telling stories, and generally very affecting stories.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And because these people are moved by the story and perhaps find themselves weeping,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   as they listen to this moving and affecting story, they're satisfied.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   But you see, the tragedy of the position is this.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   What has made them weep is not the truth, it's the story.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   It's the same sort of weeping as you get with a film, or an affecting, moving novel, or anything like that.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It isn't the direct outcome of the truth.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   It is added on to the truth.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Now it not only happens by means of telling stories.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Music does it, singing does it.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   And this of course is becoming increasingly a tendency at the present time.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   The sentimentality, the sentimentalism of singing.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   It's added on.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   It isn't great music, it's a sentimental type of music.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   And of course it gives a pleasurable and enjoyable feeling.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And because it's done in connection with a religious service or by Christian people,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   they imagine and persuade themselves that they're feeling the truth.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   But they're not.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   There is no direct connection with what they have believed,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and the feeling that is produced in this sentimental manner by the singing, or by the music.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Now as I see the modern situation, this is so largely true.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And this is what has been happening for some time.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   No real emotion, but a mechanical believism, plus sentimentality produced in one or the other of the ways that I have been describing.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   It's not only music and not only storytelling, but you get religious novels, so-called,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   or you get affecting accounts of something that may be quite true,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   that's happened in the lives of certain missionaries.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And because that produces a feeling, we feel that all is well.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   That as long as we can respond in this way to this stimulus that has come, that we are fully satisfied.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   All I'm trying to show you is that that isn't how our Lord does it.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   That isn't the way the New Testament does it.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   It's not something that's added on to the truth,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   something that has to come as a kind of supplement to the truth.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   That is one of the errors.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Or another way that I can put it is this.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   We must be very careful to differentiate between the satisfaction that our Lord gives to the heart, and emotionalism.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Now here is another important distinction.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   What is emotionalism?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   How do you differentiate between emotion, true emotion, and emotionalism?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Well, the first thing I would say by way of reply to that question is this.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   That the trouble with emotionalism, ours, is that it regards emotion as an end in and of itself.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   That's its essential trouble.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It concentrates entirely on the emotion.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It's something in and of itself.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   It wants the emotion.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Its whole attention is placed on the emotion, to the exclusion of everything else.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   So you see, because they make that initial error of isolating the emotions, the feelings, the heart, from everything else,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   and because they concentrate entirely upon this and regard this as the supreme thing,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   they have to adopt various ways and methods of producing what they regard as the emotion.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   So it is something that they deliberately work up.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   They have to create it, they have to manufacture it, they have to stimulate it.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And how do they do so?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Well, they do so, of course, by making a direct assault upon the feelings.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   It's done quite deliberately.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   What they believe, no, I'm not questioning the sincerity and the honesty of such people,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   I'm not even querying their motives.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I'm simply putting what they do and what they believe over and against the teaching of our Lord himself
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and the teaching of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   You see, what they do is they make this direct attack upon the feelings,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and they generally do so by ignoring every other aspect of men's personality for the time being.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You are familiar with the ways in which this is done.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   There are many, many ways of doing this.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Again, of course, music is one of the instruments most ready at hand.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   You get it in the most primitive peoples, and you get it right along the line.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Music does appeal primarily to the immersion.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   I'm not saying that there's no intellectual content in great music.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   There is, but there is a type of music which has no intellectual content whatsoever
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   and is simply a direct attack and assault upon the emotions and the feelings.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   So you have that kind of music.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Then, if you start clapping your hands or stamping your feet or moving them in a rhythmic manner,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   of course, you're the whole time dealing with this realm of the emotions.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   And there is a great deal of that being done.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Now that's what I call "emotionalism."
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   The essential thing about it is this, that it is emotion without any intellectual content at all.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   You see the important point?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   There's no intellectual content.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   You abandon yourself.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   You deliberately do so.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   You'll even see them sometimes even leaning back and making a deliberate effort to let themselves go, as they say,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and abandon themselves, and they're encouraged to do so.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   There is a teaching today which would even say that the intellect is a danger,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   and that you must avoid it, that it's a hindrance,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   which is a terrible thing to say, and of course an entire contradiction of the whole teaching of the New Testament.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   But it all arises because of this interest in the emotions,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   and this desire for emotion and feeling.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And thus you have this emotion which is entirely devoid of any intellectual content.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And that is the basic distinction between emotion and emotionalism.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   True emotion always results from truth.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   It is kindled by truth, it is produced by truth, it is the result of the truth.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   That's the order always in the New Testament, always as our Lord put it.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   If thou nearestest us to this woman, it's because you don't know,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   it's because you don't understand that you are as you are.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   This is the New Testament way.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   But with the other, you go directly to the emotions and attack them immediately,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   and as long as you're feeling something,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and the subtlety of the devil you see comes in here,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   because that kind of thing is done in a chapel or a church or in a religious meeting
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   or by religious people, it is assumed that the emotion is the result of the truth.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   But it isn't.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And here therefore is the vital test we always have to apply.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   What is it that is moving me?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Am I being moved by the truth,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   or am I just being moved by lilting music,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   or by an affecting story,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   or by any one of these other agencies?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   There are some who deliberately employ psychological methods,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   different colored lights, and they go out at different times in the service,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   all kinds of ways and means designed to play upon the emotion.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Now, you've read about all this, and I'm dealing with it for this reason,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   that it is perhaps the most subtle attack upon the Christian faith at the present time,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   this attack from the psychologists.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And what I'm trying to show is that very often good Christian people,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   in their ignorance of these matters,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   are simply playing directly into the hands of these attackers of the Christian faith
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   in terms of psychology.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   It is because they've never understood the true place of emotion in the life of the Christian,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   and have substituted either a kind of flabby sentimentality
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   or a more active and vigorous emotional -ism.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And this is one of the ways in which you've tested finally.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   With emotional -ism, there is always an element of loss of control.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   That is because it's divorced from the intellect and the mind
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   and the understanding and the truth.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   It always has an element of excess in it, always, invariably.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   This is a characteristic of emotional -ism.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   It's a form of intoxication.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   It's essentially the same thing as happens under the influence of alcohol or a drug.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   The higher discriminating centers are eliminated,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   and so the more primitive and instinctual element comes to the surface.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And it therefore always has this element of excess.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And there are numerous examples in history of this,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   of how innocent good Christian people have gone into these excesses
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and have brought the Gospel into disrepute
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   because they haven't differentiated between a true emotion and emotional -ism.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And another good way of testing the difference is this one.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Emotional -ism is always finally exhausting.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   It's bound to be exhausting
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   because it's playing on one aspect of the personality and overdoing it.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And the result is, as with drugs and alcohol and so on,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   that when the temporary stimulus has been removed and its influence passes off,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   the person concerned is in a state of exhaustion.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   You've had an artificial stimulant which has worked on one part of your being,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   and that always leads to exhaustion and to tiredness.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   It is all, you see, due to the fact that the mind and the will
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   have not been influenced and affected but only the emotion.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Now, all that is a complete contrast
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   with what you find described everywhere in the New Testament.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Here, you see, you get true emotion.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And true emotion is always the result of truth.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   It's always the result of this great truth coming to the mind
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   and coming with such clarity that the heart is moved and is stimulated.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And because it involves the mind and also the will as well as the emotions and the heart,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   the whole man is involved.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And because the whole man is involved, true emotion is always invigorating.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   It is almost always stimulating, and it always leads to action.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   This is one of the basic distinctions between true emotion and emotionalism.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   The poor victims of emotionalism,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   very often because there was no element of truth or of understanding in what they were feeling,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   are not only left exhausted, but their wills are not affected.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   And so it often happens that with this kind of excess that you get from emotionalism,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   you get a failure in the realm of the will, and you get sin, certain sins creeping in,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   sins that always have their opportunity when the intellect is out of action and when the feelings are roused.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And thus, again, the gospel is brought into disrepute.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   But when you get a true emotion, it always moves and affects the will.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   It is something deep.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   It is something energizing, invigorating, moving.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And it moves the whole total personality.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And so one desires with the whole of one's being to live to the glory of God.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Well, now, all this, unfortunately, was essential.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   I didn't want to do all this, but I have to do it.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Because the counterfeit is the greatest danger of all.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And I am simply trying to say through the medium of all this
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   that if I were asked to say in a phrase what is the greatest lack in the Christian church at the present time,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I would say that it is a lack of true emotion.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   There is no lack of a belief, a kind of belief, plus a sentimentality and an emotionalism.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   What I say is lacking is a real Christian New Testament emotion.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   So I put it like this, that in contradistinction to all these other things I have been describing,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   what our Lord is talking about is something that affects the whole man.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And the heart is as affected as the head.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And I go so far as to say that unless our hearts are affected as well as our heads,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   and affected by the truth that we have believed, there is something wrong even with our belief.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   There is something wrong with our Christian position.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Believism plus sentimentality does not make a Christian.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Believism plus an ecstatic emotionalism doesn't constitute Christianity.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   There is no plus in Christianity.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   It's all one.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   It's all part and parcel of the same thing.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   You can't make these artificial distinctions.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And in the true Christian, the heart is as involved as the head, and so is the will.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Well now, let's look at this.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Do we agree that the heart is involved?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Is it our own experiences that our hearts are involved?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   This is a very fundamental test of our whole position.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   The Bible is full of this.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   The Bible gives great place to the heart, to the emotional side of men, to the feeling.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   I read that third psalm to you at the beginning because the psalmist puts it very well there.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   The psalmists are very fond of putting this, the fourth psalm rather.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   "Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased."
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Of course, the farmer was always very happy when he'd had a good harvest,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   when he'd garnered in his corn, and when the wine had been prepared,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and had a good crop of grapes and the wine had been produced.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And of course, they were very happy and they had a great feast,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   and they'd drink their wine and they'd eat their corn.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   It was the outstanding occasion in the life of the Jew as a farmer.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But this man says, "Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   that their corn and their wine increased."
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He knew the other, but he says that the Lord has given him a joy and a happiness
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   and something in the realm of his heart which entirely exceeds
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   all the happiness that he'd ever known as a farmer or as a man of the world.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And you get this, of course, in so many other psalms.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   One of the great ones, perhaps, is Psalm 107.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   "Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   For his mercy endureth forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the lands
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   from the east and the west and the north and the south.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Oh, that men would praise the Lord for his goodness
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   and for his wonderful works to the children of men."
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Now, that's typical of the psalms.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   The psalms, the book of psalms, remember, is a book of songs.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Book of songs, and they sang them, giving expression to the moving of their hearts,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   their feelings, and their emotion.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   It's the great characteristic of the child of God, even in the Old Testament,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   under the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   But when you come to the New Testament, of course, the thing is yet more and more clear.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   And this is the thing that I want to put before you, my dear friends.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Why is the Church as she is today?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Why is the Christian Church counting for so little?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I have no hesitation in answering that question.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   It is because we are so unlike the first Christians.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Consider the position.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Look at the early Church.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   There were only a handful of people, and unimportant people at that.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   They had no great learning, they had no great names, they had no wealth,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   they had nothing to recommend them.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Everything apparently was against them.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And yet they shook that ancient world.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   They shook it to its foundations.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And this despised sect of the Nazarenes, these little Christians,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   they became a dominant power in the life of the ancient world,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   amidst Greek philosophy, and Roman power, and Roman law.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   This thing became dominating, mastering, and conquering.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   How did they do it? What was the secret?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Now, there's no question about this answer.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Everybody's agreed about this.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Even secular, un-Christian, anti-Christian historians have agreed about this.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   They conquered the world by their sheer joyfulness.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   There is no question about this at all.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   This was their great characteristic.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   They began like this.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Listen.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   This is what I read at the end of the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Peter, preaching on the day of Pentecost, they were deeply convicted.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   They were pricked in their hearts and cried out, saying,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Then they that gladly received his word were baptized,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand men.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   What sort of people were they?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Well, we're given a description of them.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   First thing we're told is this.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   and breaking of bread and prayer.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   But listen to this.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   and breaking bread from house to house,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   praising God and having favor with all the people.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Now, my friends, that's the Christian, and that is the Christian church.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Gladness, singleness of heart, praising God.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   This is the thing that characterized the early church,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   and that made it irresistible in that ancient world.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   They were a rejoicing and a praising people.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I could give you endless examples of this.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Let me give you one other.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   At the end of the fifth chapter, all the apostles had been arrested.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Not for the first time.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   But they're arrested, and they're on trial,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   and they're being threatened with death and with extinction.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And in doubt and doubtedly they would have been put to death,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   were it not for a man whose name was Gamaliel.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   The members of the Sanhedrin, we are told,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   And they would have been murdered there and then, but for the plea of Gamaliel.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   It was a near thing.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   They were face to face with death, but this is what I read about them.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   They were let go once more, as the result of the pleading of Gamaliel.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing, rejoicing,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And daily in the temple and in every house,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus Christ.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Rejoicing, rejoicing face to face with death.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Going on with the thing that had been prohibited to do.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Something irresistible driving them filled with the spirit of rejoicing.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   It's the characteristic of the New Testament men always.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And you get it, you see in the case of that eunuch that Philip met, you remember?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   This eunuch from Ethiopia.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   When they were come up out of the water,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   the spirit of the Lord caught away Philip,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   that the eunuch saw him no more.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And he went on his way rejoicing.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Get it in the case of the Philippian jailer in the 16th chapter.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Precisely the same thing.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   This man was on the verge of committing suicide and then believes,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   and this is what I read about him.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   and was baptized he and all his straightway.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And when he had brought them into his house, he said,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   "Meet before them and rejoice believing in God with all his house."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   You see it's universal.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   It is the great characteristic.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Even before that incident, there is an astounding thing
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   which we read here about Paul and his traveling companion Silas.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   They'd been arrested very wrongly.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   They'd been scourged.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Their poor backs had been beaten with stripes.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   And it was an agonizing experience.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And they'd been thrown into the innermost prison
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   and their feet put fast in the stocks.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Everything was against them.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   This is what I read.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   And the prisoners heard them singing in a prison.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   It had never been heard before.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Prisoners don't sing at midnight.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And the other prisoners were there listening.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   What is this?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   What are these men?
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They're full of joy.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   They're praising God.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   They're singing in the stocks with the agonizing backs at midnight.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   That's Christianity, my friends.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And I am suggesting to you that it's the absence of this
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   that constitutes our essential trouble.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   You see, this wasn't a concert that had been prepared in the prison.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   This is spontaneous.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Nothing artificial.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Nothing produced.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Nothing manufactured.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Nothing organized.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   The spontaneous welling up of that which is within.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   The truth that had captured them, moving them,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   so that whatever their circumstances, they praise God and sing unto his praise.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Now, this, I say, is the whole characteristic of the New Testament.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Look at it in the case of the Apostle Paul.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   He tells the Ephesians--you remember he met those Ephesian elders--
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   and he told them how he'd been conducting himself amongst them.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   He says, "You know from the first day that I came into Asia,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   with many tears and with temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   But let me put it like this to you.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Can you read one of Paul's epistles without feeling the tremendous emotion that is in them?"
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Now, he's interesting, of course, from every standpoint.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   I'm talking about the style of the epistles now, not the content for the moment.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   The very style of the epistles.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Of course, at once you're aware of a giant mind.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   You're aware of a master thinker.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   You're aware of a man who can organize his truth and his matter.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   It's the sheer mastery.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   It hits you, it strikes you.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   But, of course, you don't stop at that.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   You immediately become aware of this other element, this emotion.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   The way that he's obviously moved and he's having as it were to hold himself back.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   The eloquence, in addition to the argumentation and the reasoning and the logical demonstration.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   The emotion that comes surging through it all.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   The result is that you've got some of the most eloquent and moving passages
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   in the epistles of the Apostle Paul that you'll find in any literature whatsoever.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   I read that portion of the Eighth of Romans at the beginning just to give you an example of it.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Don't you feel the passion, the emotion, the working up to the climax,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   how he's thrilled with the thing that he's writing about?
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And there are other examples.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Take that fourth chapter of the second epistle to the Corinthians
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   where he rises to a tremendous climax at the end.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   He's been giving them an account of his troubles.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   He says, "We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   We are perplexed, yet not in despair, persecuted, but not forsaken,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   cast down, but not destroyed, always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus."
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And on and on he goes in the climax.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   "For our light affliction which is but for a moment."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   That's not reason. It is reason.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   But there's more than reason.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   He's ridiculing it. He's standing up. He's rejoicing.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   "Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory."
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Language failed him there. He's moved. He's carried away.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   He's up in the heavens, as it were, far more exceeding and eternal.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Somebody translates it, "Exceeding, exceeding abundant."
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Language is inadequate.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   He's on the crest of a mighty emulsion, not emotionalism,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   not something worked up by some kind of trickery or organization or preparation.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   No, no, but the sheer glory of the truth while we look.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   "Not that the things which are seen, but that the things which are not seen.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   I'll take him at the end of the third chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And you've got another example of the same thing.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   He's praying for them, he says.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   What for?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   "Well, that they may know the breadth and the length and the depth and the height,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   This is sheer emotion.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   This is mighty, majestic, true Christian emotion.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   It's the truth, you see, that moves him and makes him right in this magnificent and glorious manner.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   And there are other examples which I could give you.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   But this is not only a matter of his style.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   He teaches it explicitly.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   This is something that he can't avoid saying because it's so much a part of the truth
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   and so much a part of his own experience.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   First four chapters of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   What a bit of argument.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   What a demonstration.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   He's out to prove that the Jews are as guilty as the Gentiles.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   "All have fallen short, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God."
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And it's tremendous reasoning, it's tremendous argument.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   And then he's taken up the case of Abram in chapter four, and he's worked that out.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   It was a subtle bit of argument again.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Where did circumcision come in? Where was the law? All this.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   And on and on he goes. He's finished it.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   "Therefore," he says at the beginning of chapter five, "therefore, being justified by faith,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   That's the thing.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And then you see he can't stop at that. He's carried away, not only so.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   "But we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed."
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Why not? "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Now there it is, you see, to perfection, rejoicing.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   "Love of God shed abroad in our hearts."
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   What's the meaning of 1 Corinthians 13?
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   It's just the same thing.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   To show that if you haven't got this love, it doesn't matter,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   though I speak of the tongue of men and of angels, and have not love.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   I have become sounding brass of a tinkling cymbal.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   I may have all knowledge, I may have all faith, so that I can remove mountains.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I may give my body to be burned. It's no use.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Believism plus zeal and enthusiasm and emotionalism and sentimentality
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   and even great sacrifices, it isn't the real thing.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   It's love.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Man can produce these other things,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   but it is nothing but the Holy Spirit of God who can ever shed this love abroad in our hearts.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   And without this love, all the rest is useless.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   It profiteth me nothing.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Now, my dear friends, this, you see, is but an opening out and a beginning
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   of this great theme that you find running everywhere through the writings of this great man.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Listen to him, and with this I close for this morning.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Listen to him putting it again in perhaps the most lyrical of all his epistles.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   That's certainly the happiest of them all.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   In many ways, the epistle to the Philippians, beginning of chapter 3.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord."
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   But you see, he thought he was going to finish, but he hasn't,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   because he goes on to the fourth chapter.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say."
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Rejoice?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   My dear friends, are you rejoicing?
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Are you like these early Christians?
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   This is the characteristic of the Christian man.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   He's not merely taken a decision,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   and then has to do something else to give himself a little bit of feeling.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   No, no.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   The truth has dawned upon him, has captured him, captivated him,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   and has moved him to the depth of his being, and he is rejoicing.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   We are the circumcision, says Paul to these Philippians,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Not merely believe, but rejoice, and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Well, we must leave it at that for this morning.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   We've got to go on with this.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   My dear friends, here's the question.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Have you been moved by the truth?
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Does what you believe thrill you, move you to the depth of your being?
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Is your heart engaged?
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Your mind is, your will may be.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   I'm asking, is your heart engaged?
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I'm not asking, is your heart only engaged?
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   I'm asking, is your mind engaged, is your heart engaged, is your will engaged?
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   That's the Christian position.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   The whole man, the complete personality, captured, captivated by him,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   springing up into everlasting life."
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Amen.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
