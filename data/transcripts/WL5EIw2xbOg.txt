[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.860]   Psalms 48. A song, a psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.380]   praised in the city of our God his holy mountain. Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.780]   earth is Mount Zion in the far north, the city of the great king. God in her palaces
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.040]   has made himself known as a stronghold. For behold, the kings assembled themselves, they
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.220]   passed by together, they saw it, then they were astonished. They were dismayed, they
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.160]   fled in alarm, panic seized them there, anguish as of a woman in childbirth. With the east
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.520]   wind you break the ships of Tarshish. As we have heard, so we have seen. In the city of
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.280]   Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God, God will establish her forever. Selah. We have
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.280]   thought in your loving kindness, O God, in the midst of your temple. As is your name,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.920]   O God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.000]   Let Mount Zion be glad, let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.880]   Walk about Zion, and go around her, count her towers, consider her ramparts, go through
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.200]   her palaces, that you may recount it to the next generation. For this is God, our God
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.920]   for ever and ever. He will guide us over death.
