[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   It's a deeper question than it seems.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.000]   Predicting the next token well means that you understand
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   the underlying reality that led to the creation of that token.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.800]   In order to understand those statistics, to compress them,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.640]   you need to understand what is it about the world
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.920]   that creates those statistics.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.680]   And so then you say, okay, I have all those people.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.960]   What is it about people that creates their behaviors,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.040]   their thoughts and their feelings and their ideas?
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.040]   All of those would be deduced from next token prediction.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.600]   And I'd argue that this should make it possible
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000]   to say, can you guess what you'd do
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.760]   if you took a person with this characteristic
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.160]   and that characteristic?
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.320]   Like such a person doesn't exist.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.960]   But because you're so good at predicting the next token,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.840]   you should still be able to guess what that person
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.280]   would do, this hypothetical imaginary person
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.880]   is far greater mental ability than the rest of us.
