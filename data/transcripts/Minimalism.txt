[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.020]   I want to talk about a series of unfortunate events that has led me to conclude that
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.820]   Early retirement and minimalism go together like peanut butter and jelly
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.080]   perfect combination
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.040]   One supports the other if you're a minimalist it helps lower your costs and helps you get to early retirement quicker
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.040]   And once you're in early retirement
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:33.000]   Well, if you're a minimalist you get to keep your costs low and it helps you sustain your early retirement lifestyle further
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840]   The more minimalistic you are the less things break
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.640]   Everything breaks over time as a result. You've got to spend time fixing it maintaining it replacing it
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.520]   What a pain and when you have a lot more freedom your time is actually more valuable and therefore your opportunity
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.840]   Cost of not doing something you really enjoy is higher
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.660]   So for example, let's say you have a sick kid. You've got to take time off work to take care of your sick kid
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.620]   Of course, it's a bummer, but you've got to do what you got to do
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.280]   But the upside is you don't have to go to work. You have a valid excuse to take one two, three four days off and
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.960]   You'll still get paid. That's pretty good. Well, that's not that bad, right?
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.460]   Well, let's say you are an early retiree who can do whatever and you're really into pickleball all of a sudden like I am
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.480]   You play from 10 a.m. To 1 p.m. Every single day when the Sun is shining
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.760]   Well, if you have a sick kid, you're gonna have to give up your pickleball
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.040]   One of your greatest joys right now to take care of your child. You're definitely not gonna get paid doing your parental duty
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.040]   So isn't it a little bit ironic that if you have a day job and the more you dislike your day job
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.780]   The happier you are to do something else. So the opportunity cost is lower to do something else
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.000]   What I realized from writing my post on minimalism and early retirement going perfectly together
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.900]   Is that whatever we do it tends to get more complicated over time?
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.720]   Whether it's having children our
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.920]   Investments buying cars houses clothes. There's no natural path to simplicity
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.840]   It's actually a natural path to accumulating more and more stuff and you can do that as you gain
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.400]   More and more income and wealth and so these things are highly correlated more stuff more income more wealth
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.880]   So to live a better life, we actually have to be
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.320]   intentional with trying to keep the creep from growing too big keep the
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.640]   accumulation of jeans and shoes and all that stuff to be more intentional about simplicity and minimalism, so
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.600]   Actually trying to be more minimalistic might just simply throttle your accumulation of more stuff over time
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.040]   It might not actually make your stuff go down and then over a course of let's say 5 10 15 years
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.560]   You're gonna have a house full of stuff with things
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.720]   You don't even use don't even need and it'll start really weighing down on your psyche in my post
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.120]   I talked about five things that have been
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.600]   Weighing me down one cars. I've had one car for 20 plus years. I love cars
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.360]   I was a car fanatic who would trade in and out every one to two years in my 20s and early 30s
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.320]   but then at some point I was like
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.600]   You know
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.920]   This is just too much hassle buying and selling and maintaining and when I went to Lake Tahoe this summer
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.160]   The valet just bashed my car. Actually, they didn't bash my car
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.880]   I guess some laundry truck did and I whipped around I was like what's going on? It wasn't just a little ding
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.360]   It was a huge gash that took about nine hours of my time
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.200]   So time wasted and it took two and a half months to get my car back all the stress planning
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.800]   To go back to Lake Tahoe to pick it up to arrange
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.920]   Car transportation a rental car to deal with insurance agencies. What a pain in the butt. I was thinking myself, man
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   I wish I had zero cars, but I need a car
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.740]   I need a safe car to shuttle my kids back and forth to school and to doctor's appointments and playdates speaking of kids
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.760]   Whoo having kids really complicates your life because you care more about them than anything in the world
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   They'll get sick, which my kids have been sick off and on for the past two and a half three months crazy
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.680]   Tridemic right with RSV flu coven 19 and then they get us a sick
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.160]   So in retrospect having one child really was like a walk in the park compared to having two children and then having no children
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.440]   Man, that's just be crazy freedom. I was talking to my wife the other day
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.680]   We're at the mall and I was thinking man
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.640]   Can you imagine if we just had no children and we can just go eat in the food court?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.020]   Maybe watch a 9 p.m. Movie come back at 1130 sleep in that would be nuts and it's such a different world now
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.740]   Of course, we're never gonna trade our children for anything in the world
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.860]   We love them so much, but we responsibly figured out that two was the most we could comfortably handle
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.420]   You know before having children we never fought after having children we fight more often because we're tired
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.440]   We're cranky the kids aren't sleeping and there's just a lot more to do
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.920]   So even with children there's a minimalism aspect, you know, there are plenty of early retirees out there with no children
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.120]   You know, they live in a one-bedroom apartment or maybe even something simpler
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.800]   It's very carefree and that's something everybody should think about
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.360]   What is your limit because if you have so many children that you're miserable all the time you end up in a divorce
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.560]   You know shouting matches. It's bad for the kids. That is you know, that's tough
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.280]   That's not that's a suboptimal situation and we really don't know how far our limits can go
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.360]   but I think it's probably wise not to get to our
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.620]   Limit limit or surpass that limit because once you have children, you know, there's no going back, right?
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.360]   All right
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.600]   In addition to cars and children property the reason why I don't want to own any more
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.880]   Physical rental properties or properties in general is because something always breaks, you know
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.600]   one property had a bike stolen out of the garage because supposedly the side door was left unopened when my
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.680]   Sister and boyfriend visited - there's a cracked pipe in one of my newly remodeled rental properties
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.960]   It was remodeled in 2020 and then both sides of the p-trap cracked and I saw it. I was like what what's going on?
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.480]   So I had to spend Saturday
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.320]   Corresponding with my tenant finding a handyman paying 150 dollars to fix it and it was just unnecessary
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.240]   Stress and then in December all my electrical outlets in my primary bedroom
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.560]   Stopped working. It was all of a sudden. I was watching World Cup soccer Saturday morning
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.120]   I came back to my room and nothing was turned on. I mean what the heck how random is that?
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:58.660]   So I had to get a handyman. I hired an electrician for $145 an hour and this just takes more stress and more time
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.660]   And oh, yeah in
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.900]   January no, yeah, February 6
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.600]   2022 I ended up fixing a leak at my rental property and I end up repainting the entire house and that cost
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.720]   $20,000
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   so things just
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.880]   Naturally atrophy things break get old and you've got to keep on maintaining it over and over again
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   So from now on all my cash allocated towards real estate will go to private real estate
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.800]   Investments or public REITs this way. It's a hundred percent passive
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.600]   I can still earn the passive income and not have to manage anything. Everybody's got to find their own limit
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.000]   Oh, and there's another thing as I was driving back home after dropping off my son from school. I saw this beautiful
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.880]   Victorian house, it's probably like forty eight hundred square feet five bedrooms, you know, just classic
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.720]   1896 built and I was thinking myself
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.640]   Hmm, there is no way I'm ever gonna buy a house like that because all I can think about are where are the potential
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.720]   Leaks and maintenance issues during this winter
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.160]   Maybe the wiring is old and it's knob and tube instead of a Romex wiring. So at some point in your life
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.720]   I'm 45 now you might no longer want to own that big
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.760]   Expensive beautiful house. You might start looking at all the luxury mansions out there and think
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.820]   Hmm what a nightmare to maintain
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.700]   So if you really want to enjoy property
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:35.580]   It might be best to get that really nice house before your life gets so complicated
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.240]   So so far we've discussed about having more children more cars more homes
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.060]   well
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:49.200]   what's interesting also is that as you get older and wealthier your net worth gets more complicated and the more
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.240]   Complicated your net worth the harder it is to track and so when you can't track everything
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:02.200]   Well, you can't remember everything. Well, there's always this niggling kind of like did I miss something? What am I doing wrong?
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:09.640]   Is something at risk of exposure that I'm not aware of and so that's why we have tools like personal capital
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.240]   You can sign up at financial samurai.com forward slash PC to track all your accounts
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:21.160]   It's similar to you know feeling less stressed once you write everything down on a to-do list on a paper or a whiteboard on a
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.280]   Refrigerator you feel more at ease because as those tentacles grow
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:33.400]   It just seems so unruly to track and there is something to be said about just having most of your net worth in
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   real estate or in the S&P 500 or there's actually something to be said about having no investments and just
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.040]   making a living by working or
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:52.080]   generating truly 100% passive income such as let's say from music royalties or book royalties, so be aware of
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.360]   net worth
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.560]   Complications net worth creep as well. It's probably gonna happen to you, especially as you get wealthier
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.640]   Oh, man, you know
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:08.040]   Please put together your death file of all your usernames and passwords and put together that a revocable trust with a good
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.880]   trustee or list of trustees to help
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.360]   Figure things out just in case
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.440]   Alright, and finally something interesting part of my life
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:23.680]   Which you're listening to right now is the financial samurai podcast and the financial samurai blog and then there's the newsletter
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.200]   between 2009 and
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.640]   2012 there was just financial samurai
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:36.080]   I would write three posts a week and then respond to comments and that was that but since I left in
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.280]   2012 there has been
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.400]   Online media creep, you know
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:47.680]   I started creating a newsletter to keep in touch with people who really wanted some more personalized and special information
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.720]   And then I started recording this podcast. I think starting in
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.960]   2016 2017 it was off and on for the first couple years, but then recently over the past two three years
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:04.880]   I've been very consistent and then I did some video interviews during my buy this not that book tour and I decided there's no way
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.480]   I'm gonna do YouTube as well. So as you can see there's this creep it fills my time
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.360]   Even though I have two kids even though I'm very busy
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.680]   It's I just can't help but try to do more and more and more which is why I've
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.740]   Really become more strict on sticking to 20 hours a week or less on financial samurai
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:30.740]   Otherwise, I would probably spend easily 40 50 hours a week doing everything I can because I really like it
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.160]   But I know it's just not healthy because also
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:40.040]   things tend to break for example, if you are old-school and get financial samurai posts via an
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.560]   RSS reader like feedly
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.680]   You'll notice that it stopped working for a week and there's two thousand plus of you
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:55.080]   And the reason why is I guess some new plug-in had old code that conflicted with the PHP in
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.240]   the background of financial samurai
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:04.080]   So it caused these posts not to release on the RSS feeds and on my email feed as a result
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.480]   I was more stressed
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.120]   I didn't do anything wrong
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.380]   So I had to talk to my system
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.800]   Administrator who has been working on this for the past week to fix it and clean up the back end so it'll work better
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.960]   Why does this stuff happen every one or two years?
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.680]   Well, it's because any kind of software technology always has bugs and whenever there's an update
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.200]   Those bugs tend to come out and conflict with each other
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.980]   So now I've got to spend $400 and just try to figure it out if I was a minimalist
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.340]   Mmm, I would cut down on this online stress and online activity
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:41.920]   So maybe maybe in 2023 and beyond I should just focus more on one thing
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.520]   newsletter podcast or
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.960]   financial samurai calm this work creep is
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.560]   What most entrepreneurs deal with and the most gung-ho worker bees deal with as well
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   There's always something new to do and if you have a job that is correlated highly correlated with reward
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   Then the natural inclination is to just work harder and do more and more stuff
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.800]   So if you want to be a minimalist, you've really got to be specific on what is enough
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.440]   How much is enough what gives you fulfillment and purpose because if you're not specific in your goals and your limitations
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:25.320]   This creep of everything that we do and everything will have will continue to grow and grow and grow
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.800]   Alright, thanks so much everyone. I hope you enjoyed this episode

[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.640]   I'm actually considering
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.920]   signing a second book deal and thanks to all of you for supporting it and
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:01.820]   This puts me at a crossroads because I just said maybe I should focus only on financial samurai or the newsletter or this podcast
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.040]   so if I introduce
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.500]   Book writing a second book again. My life isn't getting simpler
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:15.640]   But maybe there is a solution to this desire to keep writing and maybe there is a simplicity in writing
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   That I'll soon find out
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.680]   Stay tuned
