[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.360]   talk about college and whether or not college is worth it. I go for a daily
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.640]   walk around my neighborhood now, basically pushing my daughter in a
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.080]   stroller to try to get some exercise and try to get her to sleep. She never fusses,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.760]   she's always good, and I would say about 70% of the time she passes out. Well, the
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.240]   other day I walked by my 30 year old neighbor. Maybe he's 29. I don't know. He's
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.720]   been living at home since I first bought my place in 2014. He went the super
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.360]   senior route and graduated college at age 24 because I think he took a year
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.480]   off and then he took five years to graduate. He first went to community
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.960]   college and then he went to UC Davis and he frankly he's not a really nice guy.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.280]   Every time I go by him I say, "Hey, how's it going?" He's like, "Hey, what's up?" So I
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.520]   don't really know who would want to hang out with him or who would want to be his
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.920]   friend or who would want to even mentor him and it just makes me a little bit
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.680]   sad. He does have a couple sports cars and a couple motorbikes that rumble in
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.640]   the neighborhood, probably because he doesn't have to pay rent or a mortgage,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.000]   but ever since he graduated I think he's just been holding down a minimum-wage
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.400]   job and when you're 30 years old you're still living at home, I mean that's tough.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.720]   That's got to be tough and especially from my point of view where all I wanted
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.920]   to do was get the heck out of college and find a job and be on my own. I would
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.520]   I would totally sleep on sofas if I had to and I did share a studio with a
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.800]   friend for two years just because I wanted to, I just wanted to be
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.040]   independent and live alone and so it is my opinion that he does want to launch but he
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.440]   just can't and I'm not sure if it's because of his attitude, again not too
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.800]   much of a friendly guy, or it's because of college that delayed him for four
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.480]   plus years, or whether it's because his parents have provided him such a huge
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.440]   safety net. I mean if you've got a nice house to live in without rent or mortgage
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.960]   expense and I don't know your parents can pay for your food and your laundry
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.880]   and so forth, why bother launching? So that brings me to the point of this
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.960]   podcast. Is college really worth it? Four or five, maybe six years of your life and
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.400]   tens of thousands of dollars or maybe hundreds of thousands of your dollars or
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.720]   your parents dollars? I decided to join my alma mater's convocation online. It's
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.520]   the first time they've ever done it. I think it's the first time many colleges
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.720]   have ever done an online convocation and I was just curious to see how it worked
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.480]   and I also wanted to feel some nostalgia, see some pictures and find some hope
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.280]   from young folks who are graduating and going on to do bigger and better things
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   and during the hour convocation, I didn't watch the whole thing but I just kind of
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.000]   skipped around, I noticed a lot of alumni, distinguished alumni, basically give
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.120]   students some messages of hope. They would consistently say, "hey you got this,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.240]   you deserve this, go out and change the world," you know stuff like that, which is
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.520]   fine, but I could see in these distinguished alumni's faces that I don't
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.160]   think they really believed what they were saying. I saw fear, I saw uncertainty,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.920]   you know one of the alumni was Mike Tomlin, the head coach of the Pittsburgh
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.760]   Steelers. This is the College of William & Mary by the way and he was just saying,
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.000]   "hey I challenge you to go out there and change the world," and I was just thinking
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080]   to myself, there's nothing to change right now or it's just impossible to get
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.720]   a job or to be given an opportunity. So think about college, four years or five
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.280]   or six, lots and lots of money and it's like gambling with when you're going to
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.760]   graduate. You could graduate in boom times, which is what happened between
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.960]   around 2012 to 2019, or you can graduate during tremendous bear markets and
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.480]   global pandemic catastrophes. I mean what the hell, how unlucky do you have to be
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.080]   to graduate this year and how unlucky do you have to be to graduate in 2008 and
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.040]   2009 and 2010. I mean those are terrible terrible years. I graduated in 1999 so I
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.160]   had about one and a half good years before things went to crap because the
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.960]   dot-com bubble burst in March 2000 and then things really didn't get back to
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.320]   bull markets until around 2003. And then obviously there was the housing bust
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.960]   2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 was you know we're getting out of in 2011 but those were
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.440]   not great years to get a job. And now are you kidding me? 2020, almost 40 million
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.000]   people unemployed and if we extend the lockdowns to July there's gonna be 50
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.880]   plus million people out of the roughly 160 million working population
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.360]   unemployed. I mean that's ridiculous, that is crazy and that's tremendous bad luck
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.240]   because things were so good up until February 2020. So I was thinking I was
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.440]   thinking how do we mitigate this risk of graduating in a bear market or just in a
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.400]   crazy year where so many things are going wrong. And the easiest solution
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.200]   really is to pay less for college and to take less time going to college. So I
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.640]   have somewhat of analogy because I did my business degree, my MBA part-time from
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.280]   2003 to 2006. I got it at UC Berkeley because I thought there was a great
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.800]   chance that I was gonna be one of the people let go because it's last in first
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.480]   out back in 2003. So yeah 2003 wasn't that great of a year. I was fearful for
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.560]   my job that's why I went to business school part-time. And the good thing
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.320]   about that was I didn't miss a beat in terms of my career. I still got promoted
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.800]   and I also got the firm to pay for about 80% of the expense. So that was good but
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.000]   that was a really hellish time when you've got to work 60 plus hours a week
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   and then spend another 20 hours a week going to business school. So for
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:10.360]   undergrad, so for undergrad I just cannot cannot advocate any middle-class person
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.600]   or lower paying full ticket or even 70% ticket price or even 50% ticket price of
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.160]   a private school education. You know unless you are already rich and your
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.800]   parents just have so much money doesn't really matter spending 70,000 to
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.720]   $100,000 a year. The risk is so much greater because the demand on what you
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.640]   do after college is so much higher. If you're gonna spend 250 to $400,000 in
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.720]   today's dollars 2020 going to private university or college in general, you
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:52.160]   better land a job that is worthwhile that provides a good income. You better
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.280]   be an independent person that you know you earn enough to pay for your own rent
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.000]   for your own vehicle and so forth. Otherwise what is the point? What is the
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.680]   point of paying so much for college and spending so much time? Conversely you can
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.600]   go to a public school and save 50 to 70 percent of the expense. So you have lower
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.720]   expectations of what you're gonna do after college and therefore you can more
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.520]   easily surpass those expectations because you really have to think about
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.560]   the cost of college not only in terms of the dollars but in terms of the time and
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.520]   in terms of what your parents have sacrificed to pay for that degree. So
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.120]   just do the calculations, be thoughtful if you're a student and think about all
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.480]   the money your parents had to put away every single year for maybe 10 years
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.960]   maybe 15 maybe 18 and that means money they did not spend on themselves and
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.560]   improving their quality of life. Let's say it all goes towards your college
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.720]   education and you end up graduating with no job or a job that you don't like or a
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.080]   low-paying job. I mean if you think about that and if you were really really
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   thoughtful for your parents I think it's really hard to make the decision to pay
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.440]   a lot of money for college. So the more thoughtful you are the more you dig deep
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.800]   into the returns of a college education and the more you understand what your
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.280]   parents have sacrificed I think the less likely you're gonna spend a lot of money
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.840]   for college. And conversely if you are thoughtless then you might go to a very
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   expensive college, have your parents pay for everything, end up with not the ideal
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.720]   job or career or whatever it is that you want to do after college and then just
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.000]   be kind of lost. You'll be lost, you might be depressed, you might then start
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   thinking about how much your parents have sacrificed, you might then start
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.880]   feeling disappointed in yourself. I mean the stakes are so so high because the
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.240]   economy is so so bad now and it's probably gonna be bad for 2020 and 2021
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.800]   maybe in 2022 or after the races, fingers crossed. You just don't really know and
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.140]   it's just a global competitive market right now. And look I know there are a
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.120]   lot of people who are going to great colleges who've got grants and
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.440]   scholarships. That's awesome. You should do that. I mean if you're smart enough to
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.400]   get grants and scholarships and have more than 50% of the college paid at a
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.640]   private institution you should probably go for it because it'll likely be the
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.800]   same cost as a in-state school, public school or maybe even less. But I'm
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.760]   talking about the masses here, the middle class, the people with average
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.720]   intelligence, people like myself who you know try as hard as possible and we
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.160]   still can't, we still can't do well on our SAT, we still can't get straight A's.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.680]   That's just the majority. So if you are rich and you are super intelligent or
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.520]   you're super athletic to get these grants and scholarships, more power to
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.480]   you. This podcast episode really isn't about that. It's about trying to save the
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.120]   middle class from making one of the huge mistakes of your life because everybody
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.840]   says go to college and spend the most amount possible on an education. Yes,
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.400]   giving your child an education is one of the best gifts you can give but it
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.560]   shouldn't be at expense so much on your retirement accounts and your livelihood
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:22.160]   and your future. And here's another thing, if colleges were more in line with
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.640]   reality, I wouldn't be so much against going to college and spending big bucks.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.480]   But no, colleges continue to charge higher and higher tuition, higher than
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.840]   the rate of inflation, every single year no matter that the college degree is
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.960]   continuing to get devalued every single year. And if you cannot find a job after
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.400]   college, the colleges, you know, they wipe their hands clean. They might feel a
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.360]   little bit bad but they're waiting for the next set of freshmen to pay them the
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.640]   big bucks. So if colleges were saying, okay we're going to charge this higher
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.480]   than inflation tuition every single year but you're guaranteed to get a job in
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.560]   one of your three fields of desire,
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.200]   okay then that would make college a more fair proposition. But no, colleges don't
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   do that. They say here is your convocation, be the best, have the
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.280]   courage to change the world, you deserve this and then you graduate and you got
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   nothing? Are you kidding me? Give me my money back. I would say give me my money
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.880]   back guys or at least give me a discount because after all these promises and all
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.720]   that literature when you're in high school, you're getting the pamphlet
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.440]   saying this is the best institution, this is going to set you up for life and if
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.920]   you don't get that and you're a decent student, you're not getting in trouble,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.600]   that's just not fair I don't think. And you look at schools like USC, they
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.000]   just recently announced that they're going to raise tuition by I think
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.480]   another three and a half percent for 2020-21. Are you kidding me? I mean after
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.680]   all that's gone on with the college bribery scandal and given the global
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.760]   pandemic and given many of their graduating students aren't able to find
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.560]   a job right now, they're still raising tuition? That makes no sense. That's out
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.880]   of touch with reality and the only people and the only families who are
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.040]   going to accept this are the wealthy families. So more and more, college is an
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.880]   indication, an indicator of wealth. If you can afford four years and that high of a
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.000]   price, then it already means you're probably kind of already wealthy and I
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.840]   don't know if that's a good signal now or a bad signal. I think more and more
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.120]   that's a bad signal because the wealth gap continues to widen. Now the wealthy
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.720]   are gonna take care of each other, they're gonna scratch each other's back,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.080]   that's just the way it is. Just be aware of what type of optics it gives out if
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:51.120]   you actually want to blend into society and do your own thing. My one request is
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.880]   that colleges keep tuition flat this year and next year or lowers tuition for
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.600]   goodness sake. What about lowering tuition for once? You're seeing practically every
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.560]   single other industry lower their fees and their commission rates, right? You see
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.000]   something like real estate used to be 6%, now it's 4% or maybe even less.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.800]   Take a look at media. It used to be a monthly or yearly subscription. Well
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.520]   that's coming back but a lot of media is now free. Blogging is certainly free,
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.080]   listening to this podcast is certainly free. Things are going towards zero and
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.720]   I'm not saying everything should be free like some politicians think. However,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:39.760]   to raise prices right now is completely off and it shows, it really really shows
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:47.480]   folks that many colleges do not care about aligning incentives, about caring
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   for their graduates, caring for the students and being aligned with reality.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.640]   And that's a problem. I fear that 2020, due to the global pandemic and all these
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.320]   lockdowns, are going to create a whole new generation of folks like my
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.600]   neighbor who has been living at home for six years and he's probably gonna live
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.400]   at home maybe until he's 40 because things are just terrible right now and
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:17.000]   students have been tricked out of a fake bill of goods. Now of course it's not all
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.520]   the college's fault that there's a global pandemic, it's actually not their
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:26.000]   fault at all. But for them to keep on raising tuition and not implicitly
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.400]   guaranteeing some type of work for all that time and money spent is terrible.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:37.200]   And for so many middle-class families who continue to fall for this trap, for
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.640]   this trap of "Oh college is gonna set my children free" or "Going to college is
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:47.200]   gonna set me free" it's just not reality now. Instead I want you guys to think
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.760]   about doing other things. The best thing you can do is find a mentor. Be an
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.860]   apprentice to something that you care about. You can find a mentor basically an
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.060]   any type of field now and I would look towards the online type of business
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.320]   because online and technology is the future. It's very obvious. If you're a
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.160]   high school student please think about your risk tolerance and the amount of
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.600]   guilt that you will have or feel if you graduate from college, spend a lot of
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.140]   your parents money and end up with nothing. Next do the calculations. Run the
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:25.280]   numbers. Is it really worth saving and spending $500,000 for college where your
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.080]   kid could go the alternative route? A public school, in-state school, a
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.040]   community college, get an apprenticeship and you can just hand them a $500,000
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.880]   check or maybe you can hand them a million dollar check if your investments
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.560]   do well and you've been saving since they were you know zero years old. I'm
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.600]   sure many folks would say give me the money. Heck if you give me a million
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.640]   dollars and told me I'd have to skip college and learn something on my own
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.560]   and invest and buy a house and do all that stuff, hell yeah I would do that and
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.680]   I think hell yeah a lot of other kids would do that too. So for folks who are
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:04.040]   graduating from college or have just graduated you guys gotta hang in there.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:11.280]   You gotta unfortunately accept lower than what you want and do things that are
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.440]   not ideal. Right now it's just impossible right now people with experience are
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.920]   just getting blown out left and right and maybe maybe 50% of the jobs aren't
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.440]   going to come back for a couple years. I'm not so sure that they will ever come
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.720]   back. Mentally it's important for all of us to prepare for one to two years of
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   just crap. So if you don't have any experience the two years is a perfect
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.280]   amount of time to gain as much experience and knowledge as possible so
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   you can position yourself for when the good times ultimately return. And if you
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.120]   have the time which I hope most of you do, I would highly highly recommend you
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.480]   start your own website, try to start your own business, look into all these things
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.840]   that people are doing online. You know whether it's Shopify, whether it's
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.660]   starting your own blog, whether it's starting your own brand on all these
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.460]   random platforms like TikTok, Instagram and so forth. It's worth trying, it's
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.040]   true it's worth trying to build your brand and plant your flag on the
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.320]   internet over time because the longer you're around the bigger your brand, the
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.840]   more people you're gonna attract and you could really make a decent living
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.240]   without having to depend on anybody else. And I absolutely realize that it's
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.080]   easier said than done but all these businesses, all these lifestyle
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.360]   businesses had to start somewhere and if you keep at it for a long enough period
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.480]   of time good things are gonna happen. And so if I were to rewind time I would have
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.600]   started Financial Samurai back in college back in 1998 and if it wasn't in
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.900]   college I would have started as soon as I got my full-time job and done
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.160]   something on the side. Because even if you just dedicate let's say five hours a
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.880]   week on the side after ten weeks that's 50 hours you know after a year that's a
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.680]   lot of time you can spend building something and over time it's just gonna
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.960]   grow if you keep at it and you will be absolutely surprised. It's a total
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.080]   different mindset, entrepreneurship and making money with your own two hands
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.320]   than making money for someone else working for someone else. It's a much
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.120]   more gratifying feeling trying to create something from nothing and I promise you
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.520]   I promise you there is so much money out there if you can build your brand online.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.560]   So thanks so much for listening and please hang in there keep on learning
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.600]   keep on fighting and I'll talk to you guys and see you guys around.
