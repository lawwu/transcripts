[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   "Is angry prayer okay?"
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   It's the question from Jake, a listener in Western Australia.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   "Is angry prayer okay?"
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   That's my question.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   "To clear my head, I often ride my bike around a local lake.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Each lap is about 6 kilometers or 4 miles, and I have circled the lake for many years.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   As I ride, I begin to speak to God. My mouth becomes a spillway.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I lose a sense of myself and zone out and speak to Him with virtually no self-awareness.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   In those experiences, there have been two distinct times I have spoken to God in a very firm way.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   But here's the thing. Both of those times, He answered my prayer within hours.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So it makes me wonder, does God actually desire that we be engaged with a blunt,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   no-nonsense, self-unaware, truthful attitude when it comes to praying to Him?"
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jake?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I remember reading the biography of Mary Slessor years ago,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   a Scottish missionary to Africa in the 19th century,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   and one of the sentences that I never forgot—and I just went and took it off the shelf here a little while ago—
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   to make sure that I got it right in my memory was this.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   She said to her supporters in a letter, "Pray for us. Pray in a businesslike fashion.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Earnestly, definitely, statedly."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And it struck me at the time as strange because I generally don't think of prayer as businesslike.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I tend to put a high priority on engagement of the affections in prayer,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and maybe she included that when she said "earnestly." Don't want to misunderstand.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But I was unprepared for the word "pray for us in a businesslike way."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Remember? I've never forgotten it. "Pray for us in a businesslike manner."
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   As if we have business with the Father, and in a kind of no-nonsense, more or less ordinary way,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   we knock on His door, state our business for our missionary, Ms. Slessor, in Calabar,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and then be on our way. And I came to believe that there is really something to that.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Not that we should be indifferent to whether we feel any affections in prayer toward our Father,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   but neither should we turn prayer into something that only has validity
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   if it consists in passionate appeals or a certain temperature of our emotions.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I mention this because it seems to me that Mary Slessor's view is at least similar
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   to what Jake is saying in the question, "Does God actually desire that we be engaged
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   with a blunt, no-nonsense, self-unaware, truthful attitude when it comes to praying?"
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And I think Mary Slessor would like that suggestion.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Let's take those four definers, those four words he uses to define prayer,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   and test them, or at least try to understand them so we can say "yay" or "nay" to what he's asking.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Truthful, self-unaware, no-nonsense, blunt, truthful.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Surely no one can fault being truthful with God.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But that's not sufficient reason for the prayer to be pleasing to God,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   since there are lots of true things about me that displease God.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   But we don't make those things—I don't make those things better by being untruthful about them.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So it's always better to be truthful than to be untruthful.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   God knows my heart anyway, and all untruthfulness towards God is futile.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You can't conceal anything from God.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So yes, by all means, prayers, truthful.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Next, Jake says that he wants the prayers to be self-unaware.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And I take that to mean that we have become so fully engaged in speaking to God
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   that we're no longer standing outside ourselves watching ourselves pray
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   and passing judgment positively or negatively on the way we're praying and how we're saying it.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I've always wanted to be like that in my preaching.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I never wanted to be preaching and watching myself preach and saying,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   "Not a good job. You're not doing a good job."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Or just as bad to say, "Hey, good job. Good job. You're doing a good job."
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   No, we want to be so fully into the transaction with the people and the truth
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   that we're not even thinking about ourselves.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Same thing with prayer.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So yes, I think if that's what he's saying, that's exactly what I want.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   You can preach or pray in complete freedom and authenticity.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So I agree with Jake.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   We want to be undivided in our prayer as well as our preaching,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   which means our focus would be entirely on God and not on ourselves and how we're praying.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I think that's a very, very good goal.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So amen to self-unaware.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But before I leave it, let me say that just like truthfulness,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   being self-unaware doesn't guarantee that our prayer is pleasing to God.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Spontaneity that speaks without self-awareness might come from places in our heart
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   which are quite unsanctified and may reveal aspects of our sinfulness.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   So being self-unaware is a good thing in itself,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   but needs other influences in order to be pleasing to God.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Then Jake says he wants prayer to be no-nonsense.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And I'm sure he means more than let's avoid nonsense in the presence of God.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   That's too obvious to consider.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   No, I think he means something like Mary Schleser meant when she said,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   "I want you to pray for me in a business-like way."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   In other words, when you walk into God's office, you don't need to make small talk.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You don't need to beat around the bush.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   You don't need to work up any particular tone of voice.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You don't need to be subtle or indirect or calculating.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You just need to get down to business and deal with the facts.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   God is God. God invites prayer. God is merciful.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   God has made glorious promises to those who trust him.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I have a need. It accords with God's revealed will.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I will state my case, make my request, and be on to the next thing in faith
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   because God can't be coerced by dawdling.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Something like that, maybe, is what he means by no-nonsense.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And I would say as long as we don't absolutize that way of praying, it's perfectly fine.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It fits into a much larger repertoire or varied ways of approaching God.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   There are many different circumstances and emotional situations
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   and senses of urgency and moods of the moment
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   that no one simple demeanor like a no-nonsense or a businesslike demeanor
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   should be made normative for all praying.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   There are times when I would say businesslike or no-nonsense praying is perfectly appropriate,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   and there are times when it would seem quite odd to approach God in that way,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   the hour after your husband was killed or your wife was killed.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Now, the last feature of the prayer Jake is suggesting is blunt.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Now, here I'm less sure about what Jake means.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   If I just had the word blunt, it would be one thing.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But his very first question was, "Is angry prayer okay?"
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And then he says, "There have been two distinct times when I have spoken to God in a very firm way."
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So we have angry, firm, and blunt.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So I'm not sure what Jake is asking, because not only do those three words refer to very different states of mind,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   but the word angry could refer to anger at God himself or anger at some evil expressed to God, but not at God.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Now, whether one ought to be blunt or firm with God depends on whether the demeanor carries a sense of disrespect or impatience with God.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And I can imagine a blunt and firm way of speaking that's not disrespectful and is not impatient.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   With regard to anger, I don't think it's ever right to be angry at God, with God, ever.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Anger at a person means, "I am very upset because you have done badly or wrong."
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   We should never say or feel that about God.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   When Jesus strongly wanted to say something or experience something different, say, in Gethsemane, than what God was about to do,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   he did not get angry with God's resolve contrary to what Jesus was asking.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   He humbled himself and submitted to God's will.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Even the cry of the damned, "Why have you forsaken me?" was not a cry of anger at God.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   God is infinitely wise, infinitely good, and infinitely able to carry out his wise and good plans,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   and therefore we never have a right to be angry at God.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   But if we are angry about something we ought to be angry about, then I don't think we have to wait for that to subside before we go to God.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And if our anger is about to turn into sinful anger, which most of the time it does, at least for John Piper, I would say,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   and that's what James seems to think when he says, "The anger of man doesn't work the righteousness of God."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   If we're about to become sinful in our anger, it would be quite fitting to rush to God in that anger and ask for his help that the anger be sanctified.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   All that to say, "Pray on, Jake. Pray on. I'm glad you're praying.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I'm glad you're losing yourself in prayer.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And may all of us have the truthfulness, the freedom from self-consciousness, the business-like regularity.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And may all of us come to God and be as firm and submissive as we ought to be as we come as a loving and confident friend of God."
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Yes, and amen. Very helpful.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
