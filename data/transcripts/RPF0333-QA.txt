[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we do a Q&A show.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.620]   I have four questions lined up.
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.080]   How do we handle lots of expected and encouraged – wink, wink, by your superior – job obligations
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.560]   that are expensive and that cut into our savings rate?
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.920]   Question number two, I am trying to figure out a way to pay for my wife's graduate
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.920]   school.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.880]   Should we take out student loans or should we take a loan against our TSP?
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.560]   Question number three is I'm in the middle of school looking to possibly start a business
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.100]   but I'm concerned about the impact of that on my schooling and my career.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.120]   Question number four, how do I take and turn a 16-week paternity leave into something that
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.800]   will help me generate much more additional cash flow?
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:04.400]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.120]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.800]   Q&A show, that's where I do my best to try to help you with some thoughts.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.200]   I try to choose questions that are applicable across the board.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.720]   Of course, you have to be the judge of the usefulness but take some of these ideas and
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:34.360]   figure out if you can apply them to your situation even today.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.080]   I have a mondo queue of questions that came in from the audience.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.840]   After I had messed up the email system and then got it fixed, I wound up with a huge,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.080]   huge, huge deluge of emails which thank you to all of you who have emailed me.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.680]   But I wound up with a huge deluge of emails and a lot of them had great questions, many
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.040]   of them from – that I thought would be applicable and useful and interesting to talk through
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   on the show.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   So today, that's what we do.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.480]   Let's get right to – well, before I get right to the question from Stephen, the first
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.040]   question, sponsor of today's show is Paladin Registry.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.000]   If you need a financial advisor, the best place for you to start your search is at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.400]   We get asked a lot, "Joshua, how do I find a great financial advisor?"
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   It's tough.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.240]   My main purpose here with Radical Personal Finance is to give you knowledge, insight
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.920]   and frankly just equip you a little bit better, give you some defensive skills against the
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.640]   financial advice industry.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   But at the end of the day, when you need specific advice, you can't have an email sit in Joshua's
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.960]   list here for six months before he responds to it.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   You need an actual advisor and a good way is to find that person is to go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.320]   It's a registry service.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.640]   Jack Waymire, the founder of Paladin, was a financial advisor himself and said we need
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.160]   to have somebody who's carefully vetting financial advisors, not just the licensing
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.800]   people who are giving the most basic of exams to people.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.520]   We need to know who is somebody's – how do we – we need to have somebody look through
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.720]   the disciplinary records and look through their experience and their qualifications.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.000]   So if you're looking for an advisor, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.320]   That will forward you through to a landing page where you put in your name, your address,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.400]   your phone number, and the amount of assets that you have.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.620]   Then Paladin will take that and they will match that up with a couple of advisors that
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.160]   are in your area and they will put you in touch with them and you can interview them
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   and see if they might be a good fit for you.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.640]   I can't promise that you're going to find a financial advisor that works for you.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.120]   It's got to be a very personal specific fit.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.500]   But it's at least a good place to start.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.480]   Start your search at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.800]   First question comes in from Steven.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.080]   Steven says, "Joshua, thank you very much for the work that you put – I mean thank
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.580]   you first and foremost for the work you put out for us.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.940]   You not only inform your listeners but also serve as a more articulate mouthpiece for
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.020]   many of the ideas that we as your listeners may share but we don't – but do not possess
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.080]   the necessary way with words to properly convey to others.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.320]   I have on many occasions simply linked someone to one of your podcasts as my retort to a
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.720]   particular argument, almost always bringing them to my or our point of view in the subject
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   matter.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.320]   I write to you in need of advice.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.440]   I myself am a somewhat mustachian.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.600]   Sorry, coined a term for your financial independence followers and I'll refer to myself as that
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.400]   instead."
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.480]   We should come up with a term.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.160]   Pete "Mr. Money" Mustache has built a huge community for himself but I try very
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.320]   hard not to poach off of the work that other people do.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.260]   I try to just do my own thing and let other people do their thing.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.480]   So I don't have any – I like mustachians.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   No problem with it.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   But we should come up with a term.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.800]   If you have a great term, let me know.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.720]   Comment on today's show or tweet it to me or something and let me know what we should
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   do.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.120]   Best I come up with is radical something or other.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.640]   That seems to be the term that I've coined for myself.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.600]   So I myself am somewhat of a mustachian having always been a spend-conscious, simple living
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   investor.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.880]   I actually came across this whole financial independence early retirement movement by
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.960]   accident and upon having become enchanted by the concept, I made the concerted decision
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.760]   to start saving 50% of my net pay.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.140]   Much to my surprise, upon looking at the numbers, I realized that I was already doing so.
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.800]   In actuality, I was saving 52% of my net pay.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.880]   Now for the kicker.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.720]   As mentioned earlier, I am in the military.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.040]   More precisely, I am a senior military officer.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.040]   With this role has come much pride, commitment, and honor.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.840]   Unfortunately, it has also come with additional expenses.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.340]   There are certain social and professional obligations that come with the territory of
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.040]   senior leadership, many of which carry a hefty price tag.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.960]   Formal events, special uniforms, forced outings, i.e. golf, I disdain golf, and mandatory socializing.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.480]   It has even been suggested to me by superiors that I should look into moving to a pricier
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.860]   area farther from base to be amongst my peer group.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.480]   Much of this is fine and dandy, save for the fact that it's having a negative effect
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.960]   on my savings rate.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:13.880]   To be honest, most of the commando fun, as we call it, is not at all how I would spend
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.600]   my time were it not in the interest of networking and being part of the team.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.920]   How do you suggest I manage my personal belief system and desired spending habits with the
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.000]   necessity to not commit professional suicide by ostracizing myself from my more spendy
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   peers?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Thanks again.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Where to start?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.040]   Steve, that's a good question because it's a question that we all face.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.200]   We all face it to a different degree and depending on our industry, it looks different, but it's
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.480]   something that we all face.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.000]   With your role in the military, it might come with formal events and special uniforms and
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.480]   forced outings and mandatory socializing.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.680]   When I was working as a financial advisor, it came with the expectation that you wear
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:05.840]   suits to work every day and that you drive a BMW or that you – what else?
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.280]   Friday night happy hour that you kicked in when you went to all the charity events that
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.760]   you got invited to, et cetera, and you buy at the silent auction and those kinds of things.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.640]   For other people, it's just maybe even as simple as going out to the lunch with your
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.840]   coworkers or going to the expensive coffee place, those types of things.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.400]   So we all face this to some degree.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:35.440]   When you're in a culture that doesn't praise thrift or frugality as anything that's
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.480]   really worth admiring, you're going to stand out and that's obviously the situation that
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.480]   you find yourself in.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.600]   We all have to figure out how to – we all have to figure out what to – how to deal
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   with these things.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.720]   Now, frankly, it's – your email is a little bit offensive to me in the sense that military
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.640]   personnel – I always think that a military personnel is – this should be where you're
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   basically given everything.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.400]   If I were to go in the military, the expectation that I would have is considering the contract
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.040]   that you make where you basically surrender all control of your life, you have no say
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   in where you go, what you do, and your life is on the line.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.440]   You shouldn't – you should basically have things taken care of.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.040]   That's the history of military service.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.360]   So if I went in the military, one of the reasons – major reasons financially speaking would
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   be that I would expect to have my housing provided and to get my stipend and just have
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.800]   these things taken care of.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.640]   Now, you're obviously not – you're a senior officer.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.800]   So things change in a senior officer and it does look like a much more political system.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.100]   It does look much more like other organizations.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.000]   But it's just a little bit annoying that you have to deal with these things.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.480]   I won't go into that subject anymore but I understand the frustration.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.400]   In some ways though, your decision is the same as the rest of us.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.920]   You have to decide how committed you are to your goal of saving money and how committed
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.240]   you are to your career and to what extent these things are actually in conflict.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:13.840]   Every career comes with costs and it's important to make an accurate accounting for those costs.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.440]   So in your case, the costs of your career are largely those things that I just mentioned.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.140]   When you're in the military, they own you.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.360]   You have no say over where you go and what you do.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.800]   It doesn't matter.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.200]   You are at – you serve at the pleasure of the – what was I – I guess the president.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.780]   You serve at the pleasure of your commanding officers.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.480]   So you don't have – that's one of the major costs.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.400]   Now these other things also obviously have a cost and you've got to weigh them.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:51.560]   It can be easy I think to lose sight of the actual costs when you are recently excited
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.080]   about a new goal.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.400]   So something like a dress uniform for dress events.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.840]   My guess is that this is a one-time expense and I'm sure the uniform is expensive but
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.000]   you probably have some sort of uniform allowance that can help offset some of it.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.480]   Even if you don't, it's a one-time deal.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.640]   The corresponding cost of this would be in the non-military civilian world would be that
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.120]   at a certain level as an executive, you need to own a tuxedo and you just need to own a
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.520]   tuxedo because you're expected to go to the charity events and represent the company
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.140]   at the gala, etc.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.260]   And there's going to be a cost for that and that's not going to be reimbursed.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.300]   You are a senior military officer.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:42.380]   Thus, you're going to be expected to attend these formal functions and you're going
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.740]   to need to be dressed appropriately.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:52.060]   If you are a senior corporate representative, you have the same responsibility.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.700]   You have exactly the same responsibility and that just is one of the things that comes
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.700]   with the territory.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.780]   Now, don't get too worried about it.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.780]   It's a one-time cost.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.180]   You can care for a uniform and you can wear it for the rest of your life.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.460]   So although it might be a big – or at least the rest of your career.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.260]   Although it might be a big expense one time, it's not that big of an expense.
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:19.820]   Now that's different than say getting in with the local once a week golf outing where
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.340]   now you're going to be paying range fees.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.900]   You're going to be paying those things on a continual basis and golf is going to be
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.260]   bracketed by lunch and it's going to be bracketed by drinks after the golf game, et
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.260]   cetera.
