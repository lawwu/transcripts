[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   So let's make that today's deep question.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.380]   Why should I do less?
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:14.600]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.800]   the show about living and working deeply
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.220]   in a distracted world.
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.100]   All right, well, I am not in the Deep Work HQ.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.800]   For those who are watching the video,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.640]   you will see right now I am actually outside.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.520]   I am recording from my house in New Hampshire
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.560]   where I will be spending most of the summer.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.320]   Jesse, however, is joining us
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.560]   from within the Deep Work HQ, so the HQ is recognized.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.320]   It still is represented in this episode.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.860]   And I have to say, Jesse, seeing you in there
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.560]   does make me a little homesick.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.120]   Hopefully everything is going well down there.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.200]   - How's the house out there?
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.840]   - It is good, it is good.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.520]   So here's what I'll tell you about it,
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.720]   because actually it's relevant
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.360]   to what we're going to talk about today.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   This house is provided by the fellowship program.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.120]   So I'm a fellow at Dartmouth College this summer.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.240]   And this particular fellowship program,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.800]   they own this house that's here on Occom Pond
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.320]   up in Hanover, so it's sort of this old historic house.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.320]   But this fellowship program's actually been around
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.800]   for a long time.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.640]   And what they do is they have interesting people
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.040]   from all sorts of different backgrounds,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.920]   professors, writers, journalists.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.840]   They've even had an ex-president here or there come through.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.320]   They come through, they stay in the house
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.680]   for various amounts of time.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.360]   Some people are just here for a week.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.880]   Some people, like I'm doing, will come for a whole semester,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.240]   a whole quarter, and teach a class.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.360]   And they come and stay in the house,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.640]   and usually they give some sort of lecture.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.480]   And so it's cool.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.720]   There's a history to this house
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.280]   of really big, interesting people coming through.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.480]   It's also intimidating, though, because what they've done
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.960]   is every time someone stays in the house,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.920]   they get a book that they wrote
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.200]   and put it on the bookshelf.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.000]   So there's bookshelves full of books
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.420]   from the last 40 years that this fellowship program
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.440]   has been running.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.180]   And you know that every book on that shelf
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.580]   was written by someone who at some point
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.400]   stayed here in this house.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.120]   It's quite intimidating.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.160]   I was just jotting down some names I saw earlier today.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.280]   David McCullough, Gore Vidal, Joan Didion,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   Robert Caro, Cornel West, Louise Erdick, Kurt Vonnegut.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.040]   All of these people at some point have stayed in this house
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.080]   and done deep work and thought deep thoughts.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   I don't know how I feel about, at some point,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.160]   deep work being on the shelf
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.400]   between Gore Vidal and Joan Didion.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.520]   I think somehow I'm gonna be bringing down
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.600]   the average intellectual quality
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.640]   of the fellows' contributions to the house.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.920]   - You're gonna put the time block planner up there.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.800]   - I'm gonna put the time block planner
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.360]   right next to Kurt Vonnegut.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.640]   And that's gonna be the heavy hitting intellectual shelf
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.600]   right there.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.760]   - Do all those people have ties with Dartmouth
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.520]   or is it just random?
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   - No, so the fellowship, they don't.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.720]   So the fellowship program just brings,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.000]   I don't know how it works.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.200]   They just invite various people to come for various reasons
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.920]   and they're all sorts of different backgrounds.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   So some of them do have a Dartmouth background.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.840]   Some of them don't.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.280]   Some of them are coming through here anyways.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.960]   I don't really know the full story,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.080]   but it's a really cool house though.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.540]   It's basically a rich person's house
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.440]   that they donated to this program
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.640]   at some point in the '70s.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.720]   So it's one of these rambling sort of rich person
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.680]   country type houses, which is, it's fun.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.400]   Fun if my kids don't destroy it
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.480]   and it'd be the end of the program.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.960]   That's it, it'll just be the end of the program.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.240]   Once they come in, here's what's gonna happen.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.160]   We're gonna leave.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.000]   I was just gonna say, we're gonna leave.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.840]   They're gonna come in.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.400]   They're gonna see the damage we've done
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.640]   and say, burn it down.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.620]   And that's just gonna be that.
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.740]   And they're just gonna, the house is gonna go up in flames.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.980]   That'll be the end of this fellowship program.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.660]   - How far from the main campus is it?
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.520]   - It's right down the road.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.620]   Yeah, no, it's a pretty ideal.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.100]   I taught my first class.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.500]   I'm teaching a class up here this summer.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.900]   I just walk to my classroom.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.420]   The other direction, there's a woods full of hiking
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.180]   and walking, they're actually cross country ski trails,
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.460]   but I can walk four minutes down the road
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.980]   and walk by the river and do thinking walks.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.300]   I mean, it's essentially, and I can see water.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.340]   So I'm looking at a pond right in front of me now.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.340]   So it's essentially a deep work generation machine.
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.980]   Drew up on paper exactly what you wanted
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.860]   for doing deep work.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.100]   This would probably be,
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.420]   this probably what you would come up with.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.260]   - That's sweet.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.100]   - But I wanted to actually use
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.460]   what I was just talking about there
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.420]   about these books and you find them in the house.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.180]   I actually wanted to use that as the foundation
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.700]   for what I wanted to talk about today
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.340]   because here's what happened.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.120]   You know, I got up here a few days ago.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.140]   I see those books, it's cool, it's inspiring.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.460]   It's also kind of intimidating.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.780]   Then last night I was doing an event, a dinner,
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.180]   a dinner with a bunch of students and some professors
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.340]   and the students were asking me questions.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.520]   And one of the students asked me a question
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   that made me unexpectedly draw from these books
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.120]   and what they were making me think about.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.960]   So a student just asked me,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.580]   "Hey, you've done interesting things.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.220]   You've met a lot of interesting people
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.920]   in your various things you've done in life.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.180]   What's something you've learned?"
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.020]   That's what she asked me.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.220]   "What's something you've learned
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.140]   from being around all these interesting people
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.380]   that you would pass on as advice?"
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.140]   And this got me thinking about all of those books,
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.820]   all those impressive books on the shelf.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.460]   And so on the fly, I put together this piece of advice.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.740]   I said, "Well, one thing I would advise
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.260]   would be to shift your time scale
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.220]   when it comes to thinking about productivity
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.780]   from days and weeks to years.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.220]   So focus on producing a small number of things
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.600]   you're proud of over the course of the next few years."
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.460]   And the books in this house
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.900]   is what was making me think about that
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.460]   because no one knows what Joan Didion was up to
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.940]   on some random Tuesday in 1967.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.460]   No one knows, was she busy?
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.940]   Was she doing a bunch of things?
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.540]   Was she here and over there and doing this call
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.940]   and contributing this article?
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.820]   No one knows that.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.340]   What they know now, 55 years later,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.620]   is that the next year,
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.180]   "Slotching Toward Bethlehem" came out and it was great.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.740]   And these books represented that to me.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.100]   These books are interesting and high impact
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.940]   and made a change on the world.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.700]   And they took a long time to write
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.860]   and no one really cares or remembers or knows anymore
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.260]   what these people were up to on the hourly basis
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.020]   or the daily basis or the weekly basis.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.620]   The sense towards activity in the short term
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.700]   can often be really disconnected
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.380]   from impact in the long term.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.340]   So this was the advice I was giving these college students
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.820]   is when you're young, it's go, go, go.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.660]   I remember this.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.260]   I remember this exact feeling
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.820]   being on this exact campus 20 years ago.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.580]   I remember this feeling of, I need to do stuff.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.700]   I need something next month to be done.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.460]   I need to show myself.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.220]   And in the end, the stuff that brought me back here,
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.740]   the stuff that brought me back as a fellow
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.140]   was actually the stuff I spent years and years on.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.780]   The slowly building up my writing craft,
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.300]   spending years on a book and trying to step back
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.660]   and figure out what I wanted to do next,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.740]   building up that type of craft.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.580]   So that was the advice I gave.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.300]   And I thought that's what we would tackle today
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.420]   in the deep dive.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:32.380]   This deeper idea of doing less as being at the core
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.020]   of having high impact.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.820]   Top layer, plan for the remarkable
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.700]   because systematically doing less in your professional life,
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.700]   focusing on just a small number of things,
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.100]   maybe even just one thing at a time
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.620]   that you wanna be really good,
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.420]   that's actually a strategy for professional remarkability.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.380]   It's a type of strategy you might put in place
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.700]   because you want one day to have a book
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.940]   that's on the shelf in a house like this.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.300]   So even though the calm layer
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.620]   is about controlling your obligations,
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.900]   we're talking more specifically now about doing less
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.860]   as a professional strategy for actually finding distinction.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.940]   Now, of course, everything builds off each other.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.020]   If you have not established that calm layer,
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.780]   so if you've not established control
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.220]   over your time and obligations,
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.300]   you don't have enough control over your life
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.900]   to be able to implement this strategy
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.500]   in your professional life.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.740]   So the stack layers build,
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.020]   you do need to work your way up the stack
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.260]   before you get to this final advanced professional strategy.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.940]   But I'm gonna put this as a strategy for remarkability.
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.760]   That's what we're really doing here
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.980]   when we wanna try to do less.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.300]   So what I did is I have one, two, three, four, five,
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.140]   I'm gonna call these the laws of less.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.900]   These are five laws I came up with
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.540]   that explain both why it can be an effective strategy
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.060]   to focus on a small number of things
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.140]   over a long period of time
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.140]   and to some degree how you succeed in doing this.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.820]   So we'll call these the laws of less.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.300]   All right, so number one,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.600]   accomplishment is non-additive.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.560]   And what I mean by that is when you think about
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.120]   your standing in the professional world,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.100]   you are often categorized.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.640]   So where you are in that world,
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.660]   you're often categorized by what you do best.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.700]   The best thing you've done
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.420]   is what gives you your professional category.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.020]   What level of skill are you at?
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.680]   What level of celebrity are you at?
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.160]   What level of accomplishment are you at?
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.580]   This is non-additive.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.480]   So you cannot add up multiple things
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.240]   that are done at a lower level of quality
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.200]   to get the equal impact of doing something
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.480]   at a higher level of quality.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.040]   You can't self-publish three books
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.440]   that are okayly written, sort of mediocre,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.560]   and have that be the same as writing one book
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.240]   for a publisher that actually caught some attention.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.480]   So you can't add lower quality
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.320]   to push yourself into a higher quality category.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.000]   But these categories where the professional world places you
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.480]   is actually quite important
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.640]   because these categories is what opens up
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.480]   and defines the impact you're gonna have.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.980]   These categories are often typically
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.320]   what opens up opportunities.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.520]   So if you wanna have higher impact,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   the higher category in your field you can be categorized in,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.640]   the more impact you're gonna have,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.700]   the more seriously people will take you and your work,
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.360]   and also the more interesting options that come up.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.400]   So this is an argument for doing less.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.320]   If the function here is a max function
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.400]   and not a sum function,
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.040]   then putting more energy into doing one thing really well,
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.540]   that's the logical strategy.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.680]   To instead spread yourself thin over multiple things
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.720]   that aren't done as well becomes the illogical strategy
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   because your goal here
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.060]   is not some sort of accumulation of effort.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.720]   Your goal here is to get that peak,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.840]   the best thing you've done, as tall as possible.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.920]   And the best way to do that
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.200]   is not to disperse too much energy on other activities.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.800]   All right, law number two,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.060]   simultaneity, oh, Jesse, I knew when I wrote this down,
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.780]   I always have a hard time with this word,
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.700]   simultaneousness, but there's another way of saying it,
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.280]   simultaneity, simultaneity.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.860]   I'm gonna have to add this.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.680]   - It's the first time I've ever heard
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.620]   you mispronounce a word.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.060]   - I can't pronounce this word.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.480]   So what we need to do here
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.260]   is somehow integrate this into a ZocDoc read.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.060]   ZocDoc.com/simultaneity, to the end of me.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.920]   Let's just say simultaneously,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.860]   simultaneously breeds stress.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.900]   All right, doing stuff simultaneously breeds stress.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.020]   Let's just say it that way.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.260]   Jesse, I'm up in New Hampshire.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.980]   My mind is slowing down.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.740]   I don't have that city energy
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.060]   like I have in the Deep Work HQ.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.540]   I can't pronounce things anymore.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.180]   Simultaneousness breeds stress, let's just say that.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.940]   All right, so what I mean by that
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.620]   is if you think about what actually creates
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.620]   a sense of burnout or stress in the world of work,
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.300]   multiple things at the same time
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.260]   is often one of the main drivers of this.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.520]   So work itself is typically not stressful.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.260]   The actual effort of working on something hard
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.480]   is not typically by itself stressful.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.260]   If you talk to a novelist, for example,
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.380]   they're not particularly stressed out
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.660]   working on chapter four on some random week.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.100]   The actual, it's hard work, but it's not stressful.
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.900]   Stress is often created by a sense of scarcity.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.500]   Stress is often created by a sense of,
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.540]   I don't have enough time.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.020]   This thing is due, and I don't have time to get it done,
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.300]   or these three things I need to take action on
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.140]   at the same time,
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.460]   they're starting to conflict with each other.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.220]   So when you're just working on one thing,
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.700]   the amount of times where you actually have
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.580]   some sort of deadline where something is due is limited.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.540]   You know, every once in a while,
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.260]   I have to hand in a manuscript,
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.220]   and very, very rarely do you have things
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.940]   landing on the same deadlines
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.200]   because you only have one thing you're working on.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.300]   When you work on multiple things,
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.780]   you don't have multiple different deadlines.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.420]   You're never too far from one thing needing your attention.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.520]   So once you're working on multiple things,
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.420]   the friction, the psychological friction of work
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.600]   becomes more pronounced.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.060]   I, of course, know this well as someone who famously
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.520]   works on two or three things,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.020]   it's seemingly at the same time.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.500]   And a lot of what I've done
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.980]   to make my working life sustainable
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.940]   is to try to avoid having these things conflict.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.540]   So I will accomplish this either
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.220]   by completely automating something.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.380]   So our podcast setup is pretty automated.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.140]   We know how it works.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.720]   It takes up time, like, you know,
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.160]   I know how much time it takes.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.020]   I know how it works.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.780]   So it doesn't hang over other work.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.540]   I can put time away for it.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.420]   And then when it comes to other types of things I do,
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.500]   I do it sequentially to the degree possible.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.100]   I'm working on this book right now.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.680]   I'm working on this research paper right now.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.240]   I try to actually put things in the sequence.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.480]   When you zoom out, it might look like
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.040]   I'm doing multiple things at the same time.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.320]   I actually really try to avoid that to the extent possible
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.120]   because interleaving, simultaneous work,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.480]   that's a breeder of stress.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.440]   All right, the third law of less,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.640]   overhead destroys originality.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.040]   So when you're working on a project,
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.520]   regardless of the field,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.840]   and we've talked about this before on the show,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.440]   it brings with it some degree of logistical overhead.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.120]   These are things you have to do
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.960]   in order to help keep that project organized
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   and moving forward, but it's worked at a shallow, not deep.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.800]   So it's the meetings you have to have with collaborators.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.040]   It's the emails that have to be exchanged back and forth.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.760]   It's the coordination you have to do.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.040]   I need to set up this interview for this article
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.720]   and we're going back and forth to try to figure out
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   the time when this is going to work.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.160]   It's the copy editing for the thing you're working on,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.560]   if we're gonna stick with writing examples.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.900]   There's overhead, logistical overhead,
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.480]   that comes along with any sort of non-trivial
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.400]   or important project that you do.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.740]   If you're working on one thing,
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.880]   the overhead is typically manageable.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.040]   The issue with working on multiple things
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.520]   is that the overhead begins to accumulate.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.920]   So now the ratio of your work hours going towards overhead
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.480]   versus going towards the deep efforts,
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.920]   the overhead is supporting, that ratio gets larger.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   And now we've talked about this in past episodes before,
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.340]   just from the perspective of time scarcity.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.040]   So when we talked about this before, we said,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.960]   look, here's the issue.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.720]   If you have too many things going on,
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.680]   the overhead takes up a bigger and bigger fraction
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.400]   of your time, and then that will begin to squeeze
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.240]   the time you have to actually work on the projects.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.560]   And so now it takes you longer
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.000]   to try to get the projects done,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.920]   which means more things can build up
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.360]   and you can fall into a spiral
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.520]   where you spend all day,
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.640]   eventually you're spending all day
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.200]   basically just talking about projects
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.400]   and almost nothing gets done.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.240]   So we've talked about that before on the show,
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.400]   but there is another aspect here that I wanna bring up,
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   which is the overhead doesn't just squeeze the time
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.840]   in the short term,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.820]   it also reduces the quality of what you're producing.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.880]   Because technically you could say,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.680]   look, let's do a math equation here.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.560]   Let's say you're working on three things instead of one.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.800]   So now it takes you the amount of time you have available
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.120]   for deep work is cut by a factor of three
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.960]   because you have three times the overhead.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.360]   Now we're doing math here, okay,
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.280]   so we're gonna do some math here outside on this podcast.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.520]   Technically, if you just solve this
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.320]   as an abstract math problem,
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.840]   you could say, okay, so it's gonna take three times as long
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.300]   to finish one of these things,
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.400]   but once you get through this time,
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.160]   this three times as long, you're finishing three things.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.800]   So if something would take you a year to do,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.900]   if it's the only thing you were working on,
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.600]   now, if you're working on three things,
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.260]   maybe it takes you three years,
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.280]   but at the end of that three years,
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   you're finishing three things,
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.520]   it all averages out to be the same.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.080]   There's an abstract math problem you can do here
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.100]   that says it's all fine, it all works out in the same.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.480]   Things take longer,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.140]   but the overall throughput works out to be the same.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.680]   But what's missed by that equation
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.760]   is when you have a lot of overhead squeezing your schedules,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.680]   when that ratio of overhead, the depth gets too large,
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   the quality of that deep work goes down.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.800]   You're not able to immerse yourself
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   in the single big project you're working on
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.080]   to live and breathe it, to have that loaded up,
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.980]   to be thinking about it, to comfortably slip back into it.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.000]   You lose that ability because you have less time to work
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.240]   and you're switching back and forth
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.120]   between different things when you work.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.400]   You have different deep endeavors.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.480]   So the overall quality or the overall originality
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.260]   of what you produce goes down.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.200]   So working on one thing
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.940]   not only gets you to an accomplishment faster,
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.140]   but the quality of that accomplishment goes up.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.360]   And that's the whole game here with doing less, right?
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.680]   This was law number one, accomplishment is non-additive.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.880]   You're judged by the very,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.120]   you're categorized by the very best thing you do.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.920]   Doing one thing is gonna push up
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.760]   the quality of the things that you actually produce.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.720]   Let's do law number four.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.940]   A slower pace is deeply fulfilling.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.480]   In general, humans are happier working on less things,
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.840]   but really caring about those things
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.320]   and spending a lot of time on them.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   This is back from the deep myths of early mythology
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.200]   forward to contemporary case studies.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.900]   We return to this archetype again and again
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.480]   of the artist, of the sculptor,
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.400]   working the marble week after week, month after month
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.120]   to produce David, to produce the Pieta.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.920]   There is this archetype of slowly producing something great
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.440]   that resonates with the humankind,
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.880]   it resonates with the human spirit.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.080]   So there's just a psychological sustainability
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.920]   to this approach.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.000]   You're working on one thing feels right
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.760]   in a way that juggling many things,
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.960]   though there might be some identity
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.920]   you can get wrapped up in about busyness
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.200]   and being able to manage lots of hard tasks,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.720]   it doesn't hit the human spirit in the same way.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.960]   So something about it just feels right
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.560]   to be working on one thing
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.000]   or a small number of things at a time.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.160]   So those first four laws are descriptive, right?
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.260]   We're trying to explain why this idea of doing less
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.400]   is a sustainable, effective approach.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.200]   The fifth one, I'm gonna think of this as prescriptive.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.260]   And I'll state it this way.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.020]   None of this works without disciplined diligence.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:37.140]   So it's actually a very hard strategy to implement.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.040]   Even if you have the autonomy to choose what you work on,
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.600]   it is a hard strategy to implement
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.880]   because it requires you to stick with something
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.340]   over a long period of time.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.920]   And this is very scary for a lot of people
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.760]   because the thought is,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.640]   if it's just up to me to keep coming back to this thing
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.120]   and I don't have any particular tight timeframe,
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.080]   okay, I have a week to get this done
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.280]   or it's National Novel Writing Month
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.220]   and I have one month to get this manuscript done.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.400]   If I don't have that type of pressure,
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.060]   I'm just not gonna work on it at all
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.340]   and this thing will fizzle out.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.260]   And that's true.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.560]   The strategy only works
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.980]   if you're able to actually deploy disciplined diligence
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.300]   to return to the thing again and again,
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.660]   while also being disciplined enough to keep saying no
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.060]   to the other things that might come in
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.080]   and take away that time or focus.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.680]   And what I wanna emphasize here is disciplined diligence
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.000]   is something to work up to.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.320]   It's not something you just choose to deploy.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.260]   So hopefully this makes you feel a little bit better
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.200]   if you're concerned about your ability
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.420]   to actually follow through
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.580]   with something over a long period of time.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.140]   It is actually artificial to do this
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.780]   and it does require some care and training.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:45.780]   So first of all, you must trust your capabilities.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.280]   You must trust the plan you have
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.660]   for deploying those capabilities to produce something good.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.640]   This is very important.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.080]   You can't just go after a big project,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.200]   focus your energy on it and just invent in your mind
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.660]   how you want that type of work to work.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.900]   You can't just say, what matters is if I, whatever,
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.260]   write every day and get enough words,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.920]   then I'll be able to sell my novel.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.460]   You actually have to confront the reality
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.720]   of how does the field in which your project exists
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.560]   actually works.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.820]   You have to talk to actual people in that field.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.740]   You have to convince yourself and your mind.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.360]   My current capabilities, I know if I do this type of work
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.220]   over this time period has a good chance
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.980]   of succeeding with what my goal is.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.860]   If you don't trust that, if there's a part of your mind
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.120]   and the part I'm talking about here
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.140]   is going to be the executive functioning centers
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.100]   that actually deal with motivation for long-term planning.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.680]   If it doesn't trust what you're doing
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.620]   is likely gonna lead to a good outcome.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.660]   It will withhold motivation.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.660]   And you will feel that subjectively
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.220]   as a strong urge to procrastinate.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.620]   Your mind is smart.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.640]   It's not gonna let you keep going if you just say,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.620]   I'm gonna write every day and it'll just work.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.460]   So you actually have to trust your capabilities
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.300]   and your plan.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.340]   And that means you really have to find a way
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.940]   to assess your capabilities non-objectively.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.620]   Am I ready to do this?
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.340]   And you need to have evidence from real people
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.940]   in this field who have succeeded before you
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.100]   about how does this field actually work.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.640]   So that becomes critical.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.220]   The second thing needed to develop discipline diligence
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.060]   is a strategy of working from the smaller
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.900]   towards the larger.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.980]   And this also really helps.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.320]   So you don't jump right into the super ambitious project.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.020]   You layer or level yourself up to that bigger project.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.780]   So maybe the first thing you work on in that field
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.180]   is smaller, something that takes a few months
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.560]   and it's not as competitive,
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.220]   but now you have a little bit more confidence.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.140]   You understand that field a little better.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.860]   You have a track record to show your mind,
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.240]   hey, this worked, we succeeded.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.940]   And then you level up to something bigger.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.300]   And then you go after that bigger one.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.220]   That's accomplished.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.540]   Again, you get a track record.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.900]   Okay, I can succeed in this field.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.740]   I know more about it.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.620]   So you build yourself up so that when you go
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.880]   for your big project, it's not grasping in the dark.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.540]   It's not necessarily a big stretch.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.780]   You feel good about it.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.460]   I'll give you a writing example from my own life.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.220]   When I decided to become a professional writer,
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.220]   I didn't jump straight into "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.420]   which was my first general audience,
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.620]   big hardcover idea book on the tables
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.020]   of Barnes & Noble publicity campaign behind it.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.900]   I actually started with "How to Win at College,"
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.740]   because this was a book that I had designed
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.260]   and sold to be much easier to write.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.620]   I purposefully had built that book
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.740]   around a collection of contrarian rules
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.340]   that were each just two or three pages long.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.940]   It was a book that was much more tractable for me to write.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.540]   It was much more similar to the type of journalistic writing
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.340]   the smaller form writing I had been doing
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.180]   because each chapter was just a standalone contrarian idea
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.020]   that was expressed.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.280]   So it was actually a bunch of little essays
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.100]   of the type I was comfortable writing.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.340]   This was part of me building up my confidence.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.020]   So by the time I got 10 years later
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.780]   to publishing "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.780]   I was ready to tackle a much bigger journalistic,
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.300]   big idea book that was aimed at a large audience.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.940]   And we see this in many professional fields as well.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.940]   So you wanna build up your confidence.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.540]   Don't jump right in.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.140]   So that's what this fifth law is so critical
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.380]   because otherwise we just romanticize.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.140]   Think about these fellows at this house
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.540]   that just disappear for two years
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.740]   and come back with their essay collection
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.620]   that changes the world.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.900]   And we think, "Well, even if I could do that,
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.500]   "I don't know if I'd be able to stick with it.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.840]   "How would I trust it's actually gonna get done?"
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.460]   You shouldn't expect to trust to get it done
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.900]   until you've actually done the work to develop that trust.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.980]   And so it gives you a place to start.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.620]   Discipline, diligence is developed over time.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.880]   You can focus on that as you build yourself
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.840]   towards a more focused professional life.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.660]   You also get the advantage that as you level yourself up
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.220]   and what you're able to produce,
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.320]   you can then leverage that to get more autonomy
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.080]   and the more and more ability to spend more time
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.940]   on a more focused number of pursuits.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.020]   So everything can link together here pretty effectively.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.260]   So those are my five laws of less.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.380]   I'll just read all five real quick.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.980]   Accomplishment is non-additive.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.920]   Simultaneous work breeds stress.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.740]   Overhead destroys originality.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.100]   A slower pace is deeply fulfilling.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.100]   And none of this works
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.160]   without developing disciplined diligence.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:32.060]   All right, so that is my deep dive.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.420]   All right, so now we are ready
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.460]   to move on to the question portion of the show.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.940]   If you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.860]   what episode are we, Jesse?
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.620]   This is episode 254.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.640]   All right, so if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.600]   youtube.com/CalNewportMedia,
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.680]   episode 254, or thedeeplife.com, episode 254.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.000]   You'll notice I have, in preparation for the questions,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.600]   I have changed locations.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.540]   I thought it was cool to do the deep dive outside.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.400]   My laptop was less happy about being in full sun,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.480]   so I have now moved to the basement of my house
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.400]   to do the question portion of the episode.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.600]   We've pulled some questions here
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.480]   that are going to deal roughly with our theme of the day.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.020]   So the questions we're gonna deal with
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.260]   all tackle, roughly speaking, doing less,
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.420]   this idea of finding more productivity
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.660]   in reducing what's on your plate.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.140]   Before we jump into those questions, however,
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.620]   I wanna mention one of the sponsors
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.380]   that makes this show possible,
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.300]   and that is our friends at Cozy Earth.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   This is a deeply personal endorsement
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.820]   because my wife and I are obsessed with this brand.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.060]   Cozy Earth provides luxury bedding and loungewear
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.180]   that transforms lives by offering
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.580]   the softest, most luxurious,
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.180]   and responsibly sourced products in the world.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.420]   I can tell you from personal experience,
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.220]   this stuff is comfortable.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.500]   So we bought a pair of Cozy Earth sheets,
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.600]   or maybe we got one from them as part of the sponsor agreement,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.440]   I don't remember,
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.620]   but we ended up with one pair of these sheets,
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.420]   and they were so good that we began to get depressed
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.580]   when we would cycle to another pair.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.060]   So we went out and bought an additional pair of sheets
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.820]   so that when the first pair was being washed,
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.180]   we could be using the second pair
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.300]   so we were never not wearing Cozy Earth sheets.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.380]   Then my wife actually went out
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.060]   and bought the Cozy Earth pajamas
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.820]   made out of the same fabric as the sheets,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.220]   so if we were traveling,
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.520]   she could still simulate the feeling of those sheets.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.980]   That's how comfortable this stuff is.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.900]   Now this temperature,
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.340]   if we're gonna give a couple other benefits here,
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.080]   this bedding is temperature regulating,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.820]   which I appreciate because I sleep hot.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.140]   It's produced with a really cool material,
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.780]   Viscouse, V-I-S-C-O-S-E, bamboo.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.560]   I don't know how that works,
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.300]   but the fabric is really comfortable.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.020]   They also offer a 100 night sleep trial.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.700]   Sleep on it, wash it, try it out.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.660]   If you're not completely in love, you send it back.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.380]   Full refund, though I can tell you
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.000]   you're not gonna send it back.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.660]   There's a reason why this brand has been featured
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:06.660]   in Oprah's Favorite Things five years in a row.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.620]   And now you can save up to 40% on Cozy Earth.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.900]   Go to CozyEarth.com and be sure to enter my promo code,
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.740]   DEEP, at checkout and you will save up to 40%.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.820]   All of this is backed by a 100 night trial
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.180]   and a 10 year warranty.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.900]   That's CozyEarth.com and use that promo code, DEEP,
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.540]   to get 40% off.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.420]   I also wanna talk about our friends at Element, L-M-N-T.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.420]   Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.700]   with everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.140]   That means lots of salt, but no sugar.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.860]   So it's a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.640]   of 1,000 milligrams of sodium,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.320]   200 milligrams of potassium, 60 milligrams magnesium,
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.380]   with no sugar, no coloring, no artificial ingredients,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.620]   no gluten, no fillers, no BS, and it tastes good.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.240]   So this is another example of a product
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.500]   that I first came across when we were thinking about them
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.540]   being a sponsor years ago.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.980]   After we moved on from that first sponsorship agreement,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.060]   I kept buying Element.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.640]   Of the various drinks of this style that I have tried,
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.220]   this has been my favorite.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.540]   I don't want sugar in my drinks
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.380]   after I've been working out, after I've been sweating,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.060]   after I've been outside doing yard work.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.020]   I don't want sugar, but I want that salt.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.380]   Nothing has hit the spot quite like
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.820]   Element hits the spot for me.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.020]   So I'm very happy that they're back
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.500]   to being a sponsor of the show.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.740]   Electrolytes facilitate hundreds of functions in the body,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.540]   including the conduction of nerve impulses,
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.340]   hormonal regulation, nutrient absorption,
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.920]   and fluent balance.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.360]   So especially if you're losing some salt out there in sweat,
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.860]   you need to replace those electrolytes.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.880]   This is the very best drink to do it.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.980]   I use it many times a week.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.500]   And I'll even titrate a little bit.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.440]   I don't know if this is official,
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.960]   but sometimes depending on
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.100]   if I'm just feeling dehydrated in the morning,
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.500]   I might use half a packet in a drink,
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.000]   versus if I've just done a workout in the DC summer,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   I can use that full packet.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   So anyways, I am an Element fan.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.340]   So right now Element is offering a free sample pack
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.180]   with any purchase.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.820]   That's eight single serving packets free
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.180]   with any Element order.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.420]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.700]   or to share Element with a salty friend.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.460]   Get yours at drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.140]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.140]   You must go to drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:40.380]   That's drinkelement.com/drink.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.460]   Try it totally risk-free if you don't like it.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.260]   Share it with a friend and they will give your money back.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.180]   No questions asked.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.140]   You have nothing to lose.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.660]   All right, Jessie, this is our first time in a while
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.540]   trying to do questions.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.380]   We're remote.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.380]   We're not in the same room,
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.700]   but we're still gonna make this work.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.880]   What questions do you have for me first?
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.020]   - Hi, first question's from M.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.940]   I'm returning to teaching after a break
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.440]   to work in administration.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.740]   I'm curious if you have advice
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.540]   for re-approaching this type of work
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.780]   in a way that guards against burnout
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.680]   and prioritizes craft, deep work, and slow productivity.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.060]   - Well, M, I've heard from teachers in particular.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.420]   So let me try to tailor my advice
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.140]   at first to your particular situation.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.340]   And then we can extract from this
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.260]   some general observations that are relevant
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.740]   for people in general embracing slow productivity.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.500]   One thing that's critical in teaching
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.580]   at the level that you're doing
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:41.360]   is to be very careful about taking on extra responsibilities.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.940]   Your margin for time is very narrow.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.400]   You're basically in front of students, as you know,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.280]   for many of the hours of the typical eight-hour workday.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.420]   You're left with, I don't know, an hour,
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.820]   maybe 90 minutes within a nine-to-five,
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.660]   nine-to-530 day to work on everything else,
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.060]   prepping classes, grading, et cetera.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.500]   There are a lot of opportunities,
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.620]   especially if you're teaching at the secondary level
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.620]   or maybe the middle school level.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.580]   There's a lot of opportunities for other things you can do.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.920]   Be very careful about that.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.420]   Be very careful about volunteering.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.780]   I'm not trying to be curmudgeonly
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.020]   or to make you into a misanthrope.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.980]   I'm just saying your time is limited.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.780]   So right off the bat, as you return to teaching,
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.100]   be very protective of that time.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.620]   Your first order of business,
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.660]   especially when you're new back,
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.020]   is just focusing on doing your core obligation
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.700]   of teaching and molding these young minds
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.980]   as well as possible.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.780]   Another thing I'm gonna recommend, again,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.900]   to, we're all trying to avoid
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.840]   unsustainable overload right now.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.140]   The other thing I'm gonna recommend
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.540]   is that to the extent possible,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.940]   set up assignments in ways that makes your life easier.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.660]   Now, this is something professors know a lot about.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.420]   There are many different types of assignments
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.020]   you can give your students.
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.580]   Some of these forms are gonna require
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.140]   much more time from you than others,
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.100]   but there's often the same pedagogical impact
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.940]   on the students.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.020]   So often you can think about different ways
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.100]   you might evaluate your students,
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.100]   which gets you to the same pedagogical goals.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.660]   The students are going to learn,
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.180]   they are gonna be assessed,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.300]   but there's some ways to do that
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.900]   that's gonna make your life much easier than others.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.340]   Do not feel guilty
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.940]   about shaping your courses and your assessments
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.780]   around easier, more sustainable for you approaches.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.340]   This is actually about making you into a better teacher.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.900]   If you have more time,
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.940]   if you're not up to your neck
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.300]   and impossible to grade ambiguous essays
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.300]   that make you stay up late at night,
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.140]   if you're not doing that,
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.300]   you're gonna be better at the other aspects
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.500]   of your teaching.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.580]   And from the student's perspective,
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.660]   there's lots of different assessments.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.020]   They all are basically the same.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.940]   They don't really care.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.260]   They don't really recognize that much.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.980]   So think about yourself.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.220]   Do not be a martyr to pedagogical innovation.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.380]   I see this a lot.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.300]   You say, "I just wanna, I have this cool idea
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.820]   "for we're gonna do these type of projects."
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.820]   And it feels kind of innovative
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.900]   and it sucks a huge amount of time away from you as a teacher
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.380]   and now you actually can't show up as a teacher.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.820]   In your effort to be a better teacher,
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.660]   you made yourself work.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.860]   So be very careful about how you set up your assignments.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.540]   Prioritize or keep yourself and your own,
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.860]   the demands on you, keep that in mind.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.300]   You probably are gonna have to work outside of nine to five.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.140]   That's just the reality of teaching today.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.660]   So let's do that intentionally.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.620]   I'm gonna say use automation and elevation here.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.180]   So automation means it's the same time, same place,
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:31.260]   the same days of the week that you do the work
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.620]   that has to happen outside of the nine to five.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.020]   You do not want these efforts,
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.720]   the extra grading, the extra prep you have to do.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.860]   You don't want it to be something
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.740]   that just hangs over your head at all times.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.520]   And you always feel like you should be working on it
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.180]   and it just, "Ah, it's Thursday night.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.220]   "I better, I gotta do this.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.140]   "I have to prep for class," automate.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.440]   This is how I do it.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.560]   This is when I do it.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.580]   This is where I do it.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.920]   You're doing the work outside of the nine to five
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.020]   on your own terms.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.020]   And it might be something as simple as,
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.240]   "All right, on Tuesdays, I've set up with my partner
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.740]   "that I actually come home at 6.30 instead of five.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.940]   "And that is, on Tuesday is when I finish my prep
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.540]   "for the rest of the week through next Monday."
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.420]   We just have that set up.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.540]   I don't even have to think about it.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.100]   And Saturday morning, I have a grading block
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.660]   and I've given assignments so that two and a half hours
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.660]   on Saturday morning, I can definitely get the grading done.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.060]   Now I know when that work happens
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.680]   and all the other times outside of work,
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.260]   I'm not worried about it.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.240]   I'm relaxed.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.520]   I'm going on with the rest of my life.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.620]   I'm not feeling overloaded.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.020]   I'm not feeling burnt out.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.020]   The elevation piece of this, that's automation.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.460]   The elevation piece is be careful about the locations
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.640]   and the rituals around this work.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.300]   Have a cool place you go.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.900]   You know, Saturday morning, maybe you do the grading
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.480]   at a particular coffee shop
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.480]   or if you live in a city, you go to a cafe in a museum.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.620]   So you set up the location to be inspiring or interesting
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.260]   or have other benefits to it.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.300]   It gets you to, you like the coffee they serve here
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.500]   to a long walk to get to where you do the work.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.740]   Think these things through so that the work outside
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:08.300]   of the normal nine to five does not hit you as a burden.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.620]   It doesn't hit you as, "Oh my God,
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.820]   "this thing is hanging over me
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.620]   "and it's sapping away other things I enjoy."
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.740]   You've actually elevated it into an intellectual experience
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.360]   that you can actually get some satisfaction out of.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.840]   Finally, a lot of this is about keeping work at bay.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.460]   The other aspect here is improving craft.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.540]   And this is where I'm gonna give you
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.440]   a slow productivity approach.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.820]   Choose one thing per marking period,
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.280]   one aspect of the teaching craft
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.840]   that you are systematically but slowly improving.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.000]   Don't try to go too fast here.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.860]   Days are short, years are long.
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.680]   That's the way I like to think about it.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.700]   If you're constantly working slowly but steadily
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.900]   on some aspect of your teaching craft,
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.300]   give that three years
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.900]   and you're gonna be a much better teacher than you were.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.320]   You don't have to rush this.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.040]   You don't have to be up till midnight every day
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.380]   in the first September you're back
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.620]   trying to come up with all these grand projects
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.720]   and new schemes that are gonna engage your students.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.980]   Slow but steady.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.900]   That's the way you avoid burnout here.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.900]   Allow these improvements to accumulate over time.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.060]   So if in a marking period you say,
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.360]   I'm just working on this one thing.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.820]   How do I, I don't know, I'm teaching calculus.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.900]   And I'm working on the way I am trying to convey
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.460]   some of these techniques to the students.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.700]   Maybe I don't wanna just write things on the board.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.140]   Let me just really start thinking through it
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.220]   just a little bit.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.500]   On the way to work, I think about it.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.740]   I try things, I take notes.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.140]   It's not a lot of time in any one day,
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.580]   but I spend four months or three months
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.460]   just working on this.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.060]   And in that marking period,
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.900]   I have a slightly better method for teaching calculus.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.260]   I figured out what works and what doesn't.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.080]   That's working better.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.920]   Now the next marking period,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.140]   I'm gonna try to push that to the next level.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.340]   The slow but steady improvement of craft
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.560]   is not gonna change things much in the first few weeks,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.500]   but after a few years,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.860]   you might actually be considered an exceptional teacher.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.860]   And you did this without having to break your schedule.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.660]   You did this without having to be completely overloaded.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.700]   And I think this general template we can export
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.980]   to many other types of knowledge work professions
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.740]   that are similar to teaching.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.540]   These ideas about being careful with your time,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.020]   setting up your work in ways
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.560]   that keeps in mind the demands on you.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.860]   If you have two equivalent ways of doing something,
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.700]   and one's gonna require much less time,
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.740]   don't feel guilty about deploying that way.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.460]   Automate and elevate where you do work,
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.700]   especially work that's outside of the normal work hours,
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.380]   and work on improving craft,
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.700]   but do it slowly but steadily.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.180]   So that's gonna be a general template here
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.900]   that hopefully we can extrapolate
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.740]   to multiple different positions.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.700]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.820]   - All right, next question is from Jim.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.380]   How do you know if a big, slow productivity idea
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.700]   is good enough to warrant the daily effort?
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.980]   Background, I'm a full-time online writer,
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.540]   and I have a book idea.
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.780]   I think that I might find an audience,
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.640]   but I don't know if it will work.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.340]   - Well, this is very important.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.500]   Jim, we talked about this
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.900]   with the final law of less during the deep dive,
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.820]   but this gives us a specific case study to tackle.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.260]   So let's go back and remember what I said
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.580]   in that fifth law of less,
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.480]   and we'll apply it to your particular situation
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.560]   about working on a book idea.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:25.020]   So first of all, you're going to want to work up
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.620]   to bigger size projects.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.420]   You might not wanna start right away
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.780]   with just I am writing a book, right?
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:36.260]   What is actually happening here is, okay, can I write?
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.980]   Have I actually published some writing before?
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   All right, that's a step.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.720]   Do I have an agent?
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.100]   Well, that's gonna be another first step.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.540]   If I can get an agent, that's gonna be a justification
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.580]   or validation that my idea is good,
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.040]   and there's someone else who's a professional
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.580]   who thinks I'm the right person to write it.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.620]   So let me make that the next step.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.700]   Now I got that done.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.980]   Now I feel a little bit more confident.
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.160]   Now I'm writing sample chapters for the proposal.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.980]   I can write two sample chapters.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.740]   That's hard, but that's more tractable.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.260]   My agent likes these sample chapters.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.820]   Oh, now we've sold the book.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.980]   Now we've actually can go,
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.460]   now when I'm going ahead and writing this book,
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.740]   I've done some writing, I've gotten an agent,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.900]   I've written some sample chapters.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.020]   Those sample chapters convinced the publisher.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.100]   Now you're gonna find motivation to finish this book.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.460]   This is all very different than just saying,
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.820]   let me just start writing.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.420]   I think I could produce something really good.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.020]   The executive functioning center of your brain
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:27.220]   is gonna look at that plan and says, says who?
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.700]   How do you know that anything,
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.340]   that this at all is gonna turn up?
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.460]   We have no evidence.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.260]   We have no background experience
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.380]   with just writing every day
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.900]   and it turns out producing a book.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.260]   So I would say you really wanna ladder your way up
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.240]   to this bigger, longer project.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.740]   Now the foundation to what I'm talking about here
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.900]   that sort of underscores all of this
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.380]   is to be ruthlessly evidence-based
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.900]   in figuring out your plan
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.660]   for the thing you want to accomplish.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.340]   So again, I'm really worried when I hear about,
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.740]   for example, a writer saying,
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.180]   yeah, I'm just gonna start writing every day
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.300]   because that tells me you haven't talked to someone
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.420]   in the publishing industry.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.180]   You don't understand how the publishing industry works
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.020]   or you do understand and you reject it.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.700]   You're nervous about talking to an agent
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.980]   'cause they might not like your book idea.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.020]   So you're gonna have the circuitous approach
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.420]   where well, write it myself,
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.160]   but then I'll be very clever about the marketing
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.100]   and we'll do this and that.
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.460]   And then the agents will come to me later
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.540]   and wanna buy my book.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.420]   You're inventing your own story
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.420]   about how the industry works
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.040]   because you either don't know or you don't like
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.180]   or you're afraid of what the actual story really is.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.460]   You have to be ruthlessly evidence-based
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.140]   when coming up with what you're gonna work on
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.140]   and how you're gonna work on it
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.060]   for one of these diligent, disciplined,
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.700]   long-term project endeavors
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.220]   because it's a really big investment of time.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.700]   Your brain has to trust.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.300]   You know what you're doing
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.860]   and this has a chance of succeeding.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   So do not skip the step of ruthlessly gathering evidence
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.160]   about how your field actually works.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.100]   Now, I see this all the time.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.740]   There's a lot of other common examples
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.900]   where people will write their own stories
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.040]   instead of actually figuring out how a field works.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.560]   This happens in tech startups a lot.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.800]   I talk to people that like the idea
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.720]   of having a technology startup,
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.560]   but don't actually want to talk to,
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.200]   let's say funders or investors
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.240]   or get a sense of what would make a company attractive
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.080]   to an investor that would allow an exit,
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.720]   that would allow growth or acquisition.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.900]   They don't want those stories.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.940]   They want it just to be the fun stuff
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.500]   that I have a Slack account set up
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.700]   and I'm jumping on calls with people
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.280]   to get their ideas about things
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.160]   and paying web developers to set up a website.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.840]   They don't want the reality
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.780]   of what is the technical skill required?
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.100]   What is the work that actually goes into producing something
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.380]   that is good enough that has the potential scalability
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.520]   that can actually attract funding?
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.180]   How much talent does that actually require?
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.660]   I don't know how many times I've heard someone say,
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.780]   yeah, I just need to find a programmer type
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.380]   to build the thing, but I've got this great idea.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.140]   They want just the fun part, not the hard part.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.220]   And there's other fields too,
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.380]   where you'll see the same thing.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.220]   You'll see it in podcasting.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.080]   But what actually, talk to a successful podcaster.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.460]   How does a podcast become financially viable?
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.160]   It's rare.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.180]   So what are the elements
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.900]   that makes a podcast financially viable?
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.900]   How do you, what is required to actually get there?
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.780]   What type of audience or content
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.460]   and what differentiates a successful one
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.300]   from a non-successful one?
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.380]   People don't wanna hear that too.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.100]   They just say, I just wanna start recording
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.020]   because you never know, maybe I'll be Joe Rogan.
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.300]   Even though that's not how it actually happens.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.660]   So ruthlessly evidence-based approach
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.180]   to these big ambitious projects.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.340]   It sounds at first like a downer,
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.780]   but it is the fuel that will allow you
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.100]   to actually continue and get something big done.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.720]   The bad news is it might take a lot of things
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.780]   off the table at first.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.300]   Things that you wanna do for your big projects.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.980]   You gather the evidence and you realize
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.560]   I'm not in a good position to do this.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.400]   And that is a downer.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.780]   But what it does mean,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.220]   and this is the side, the benefit.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.100]   When you do find a thing that is reasonable
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.580]   for you to pursue, that feeling of motivation you have,
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.800]   when the evidence is there to back it up,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.020]   you've built your way up to this,
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.980]   your mind believes that that feeling of motivation
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.820]   is really powerful.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.260]   And a lot of people don't even recognize it
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.080]   until they get it.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.240]   And then they say, oh, this is what it feels like
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.580]   to go after something big
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.980]   in a way that is deeply grounded in reality
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.020]   and has a real chance of succeeding.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.500]   It just feels very different than the,
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   I'm writing every day, I'm doing my thousand words,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.260]   I'm having Zooms with people about my startup idea,
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.420]   I bought a USB mic and now I'm a podcaster.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.900]   It really feels different once you have
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.940]   that foundation of evidence.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.500]   So I'm glad you brought this up, Jim,
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.180]   because I think that's, it's downplayed too much
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.460]   when we talk about these big, ambitious, long-term projects.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.260]   All the prep work is often ignored.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.780]   And we just say, well, have the courage
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.540]   to follow your passion and just go for it.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.060]   Don't go for it until you're so convinced
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.860]   that you'd be dumb not to, that you have no other choice.
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.660]   All right, Jesse, I don't know, Jesse,
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.540]   I kind of feel now like I'm temporarily back
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.940]   in that beginner podcast phase.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.660]   I have a USB microphone, I'm in a basement,
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.420]   I'm not in the HQ.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.540]   I feel like we're taking steps backwards here.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.500]   Though actually, I think, this is what's gonna be fun.
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.140]   I think listeners are gonna see
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.580]   and viewers are gonna see,
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.300]   I'm slowly going to evolve my setup here
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.860]   as the summer goes on.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.580]   Because I flew up here and I'm flying back
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.740]   to drive up with my family.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.700]   So I'm gonna be bringing more equipment up
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.060]   in a couple of weeks.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.460]   Nice cameras, some nice lighting.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.460]   My goal is by the time we get to mid-August,
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.340]   that this house here at Hanover
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.060]   is gonna be producing a really slick looking podcast.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.900]   I think it's gonna be a fun project.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.700]   I'm gonna build a cool setup here.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:42.980]   It really will be the Deep Work HQ North once I'm done.
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.620]   So that'll be a fun progression to watch
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.460]   as the summer unfolds.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:47.300]   - Yeah, baby.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.260]   - All right, let's do another question.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.100]   What do we got?
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.860]   - Hi, next question's from Amanda.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.380]   I work in secular teacher education
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.700]   and I've been considering whether I would
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.580]   eventually do a pivot to apply everything
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.980]   that I've learned within my career
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.620]   to independently offering courses
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.460]   related to Christian topics that interest me.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.100]   Your concept of slow productivity is encouraging
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.060]   as it shows how great work can develop
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.220]   little by little on the side of a main career.
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.740]   How should I apply these ideas
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.220]   in slowly building toward my pivot?
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.420]   - Well, Amanda, I like that you're embracing
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.660]   slow productivity here.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.940]   I think this idea of working slowly and steadily
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.900]   on one thing is a great fit for this particular scenario
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.740]   you're talking about.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.900]   And we haven't touched on the scenario yet in this show,
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.740]   so I'm glad you brought it up.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.060]   But the scenario of I have this job,
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.900]   I wanna do this other job,
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.500]   so I want to on the side work on something
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.560]   to distinguish myself.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.700]   And that is a great place for the slow but steady
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.500]   approach to be applied.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.420]   And I think it's a great place for two reasons.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.740]   One is just a quality reason.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.260]   So as I covered in the Laws of Less,
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.780]   when you have this one thing in a particular field
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.180]   that you're giving all of your attention to
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.960]   and just keep coming back to again and again,
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.980]   relentlessly but sustainably,
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.700]   you're never too long from working on it,
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.420]   but you're never working a lot on it
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.380]   in a short period of time.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.320]   You're never staying up late to work on it.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.180]   That is, as we talked about in the Laws of Less,
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.300]   the recipe for producing the highest quality
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.820]   that you are capable of producing.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.060]   That is critical when you have a side project
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.100]   that eventually is gonna provide the pivot
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.400]   into something else.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.520]   You are gonna get the most options
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:33.760]   if what you're working on is as good as possible.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.080]   So the better the thing you produce,
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.820]   the more options you're gonna have
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.740]   about how to leverage that to change your career
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.300]   or push you into a different trajectory.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.360]   So quality is very important here.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.660]   Knocking something out of the park,
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.740]   producing something too good to be ignored
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.140]   is a really good way to try to actually
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.660]   induce a professional pivot.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.780]   So slow but steady, as we talked about,
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.880]   is a good formula for that.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.660]   The other element that makes that a good match
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.820]   for what you're doing is that it can fit
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.940]   into a life where there's other things going on.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.700]   Slow but steady work is very flexible.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.420]   It means when you have a really busy day,
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.780]   you don't work on the project, that's okay.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.780]   When you have a slightly easier day,
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.060]   you're able to make more progress.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.200]   And when you have a, you're a teacher,
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.500]   so when you have a summer,
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.700]   maybe you're working on it a lot.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.100]   So you can have this natural variation in pacing.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.540]   All that matters with a strategy
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.940]   is you're never too far from the work.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:32.660]   You just wanna keep coming back to it again and again.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.260]   It's relentless, but it's not overwhelming.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.820]   And it's very flexible for,
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.860]   these three days we did nothing,
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.620]   but these three mornings we did do something.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.620]   And during this month where we had time off,
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.900]   I was working a few hours every morning.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.680]   Slow but steady is very adaptable, very sustainable.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.160]   It's something you can fit next to other work you're doing
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.380]   because you're not charging towards some deadline.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.580]   This has to be done in this time.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.900]   And oh my God, I don't have enough time.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.380]   I have to stay up late to get it done.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.620]   It can adapt to the time available.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:02.100]   And as long as you don't abandon it,
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.180]   as long as you've done the other things we've talked about
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.900]   for developing disciplined diligence,
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.420]   you will keep moving until you accomplish it.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.700]   The timeframe will depend on how busy the work is,
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.460]   but it will get done.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.540]   But it will get done in a flexible and a sustainable way.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.340]   So I think the slow but steady,
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.300]   slow productivity approach is a really good fit
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.720]   for what you're thinking about, Amanda,
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.460]   which is building on the side,
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.140]   something that one day will be at the center
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:28.180]   of what you're doing.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.740]   All right, let's see.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.560]   Let's do one more question.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.400]   What do we got here, Jesse?
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:33.900]   Let's do one more.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.900]   - All right, next question is from Mahmood.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.540]   How do you read five books monthly
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.780]   with all your other duties and responsibilities?
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:45.020]   Do you have a one and a half hour time block daily?
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.300]   Do you have your paper book everywhere with you,
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.580]   or do you read it on your phone?
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:52.020]   - Well, Mahmood, I can, first of all,
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.260]   I'll say I did a video about this.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:57.300]   So you can find at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.540]   Somewhere on there, there's a video,
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.140]   how does Cal Newport read five books a day,
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:01.980]   or something like this.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.060]   I don't think it's too hard to find.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.740]   But let me just hit on a few.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.900]   - Five books a day, baby.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.700]   - There we go, five books a day.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.380]   I'm telling you, up here in New Hampshire,
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.460]   it's super productive.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.540]   Five books a day, no problem.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.320]   Go for long walks in the woods.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.880]   That's the way you do it, five books a month.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.780]   Come on, five books a day.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.220]   Let's get after it.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.720]   All right, five books a month.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.740]   So how do I actually do that?
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.500]   Let me just, I'll mention a couple points here.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.300]   I'll mention a couple points here.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.060]   A huge part of this, and it's hard for people
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.180]   to believe until they try this,
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.340]   is that I don't distract myself with my phone.
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:40.380]   I don't have interesting things on my phone.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.560]   I don't have social media.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.540]   I don't have, I don't know, a YouTube app on there.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:47.820]   My phone is pretty boring.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.460]   I mean, the most distracting my phone is,
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:52.580]   is if we're in a period where the Washington Nationals
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.500]   are doing well, I'm gonna be checking those scores
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.740]   while the game is going on.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.960]   Fortunately, I don't have to worry about that right now.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.240]   So there is no distraction coming from my phone.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.500]   It makes a huge difference.
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.820]   You don't realize how much of your time
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.520]   goes towards essentially paying the bills
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.160]   of these attention economy corporations
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.860]   that are packaging and monetizing your attention for money.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.960]   You don't realize how many shifts you are pulling
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.700]   in their attention factories
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.380]   until you actually take that out of your life.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.260]   When you do take that out of your life, you have downtime.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:25.160]   There's more downtime than you would think.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.300]   Even if you have a busy job, like I do,
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.980]   even if you have a lot of kids, like I do,
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.020]   there is still downtime.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.700]   The kids are watching a show, dinner's not ready yet.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.340]   You know, there's nothing to really do right now.
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.760]   I could read.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.340]   There's a lot more of that downtime than you think.
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.660]   The second piece of this is just changing your identity.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.780]   Your self identity is I'm a reader.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:49.900]   I like to read books.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.740]   That's what I do.
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.780]   I'm excited about books.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.020]   I seek out books I'm excited to read.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:56.000]   I look forward to reading more of those books.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.060]   When you think about yourself as a reader,
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.460]   then you're much more naturally going to fill
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.980]   these type of downtimes with reading.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.180]   So I don't schedule time to read,
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.020]   but a lot of reading tends to get done.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.340]   I read during downtime.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.640]   I'll read while I'm eating lunch.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.860]   If I'm up before the kids,
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.020]   I'll get maybe 20 minutes of reading in there.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.440]   I'll read in bed at night before I go to sleep.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.480]   My wife and I often do reading sessions at night
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.140]   after the kids go to bed.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.260]   Go to the library.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.980]   If it's the winter, we turn on the fireplace in there.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.340]   Let's read for a half hour.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.040]   This morning, you know, here in New Hampshire,
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.940]   I walked down to the Dirt Cowboy,
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.380]   the coffee shop right there on the main street in Hanover,
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:35.180]   and I got a flavored coffee.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.260]   I was reading a book I'm working on.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.340]   Why not, right?
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.580]   It's just natural.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.580]   So if you aren't distracting yourself with the phone,
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.140]   and you think of yourself as a reader and take real pride
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.500]   in engaging with the well-crafted idea
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.220]   expressed through the written word,
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.640]   you will get a lot of books read.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.220]   So I don't stretch myself that much
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.860]   to read five books a month.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.580]   I just have enough opportunities to read.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.880]   Some days I'm reading more than others.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:01.060]   It's usually not that hard for me to hit that mark.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.380]   And I have to say, Mahmood, I recommend it.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.740]   The reading life is a deep life.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.420]   The reading life is calisthenics for your brain.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.360]   Your brain is now constantly grappling
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.420]   with both complex structures of ideas
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.420]   as well as complex understanding of other human psychology,
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.980]   especially if you're reading novels.
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.540]   So it's calisthenics for your brain.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.900]   It makes your brain better
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.660]   at dealing with that information.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.500]   It builds the scaffolding of thought
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.640]   on which you can produce original ideas.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.340]   It produces the scaffolding of thought
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.700]   upon which you can build your own understanding
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.300]   of yourself and your life.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.540]   It literally changes your perception of yourself
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.500]   and the world the more you are reading.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.460]   It is like a superpower.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.460]   It calms your mind.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.020]   It gives you insight and perception.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.160]   It connects you to other people.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.900]   It really is, if you wanna have a deep intellectual life,
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.420]   it really is deferment on which that can be built.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.780]   And it's not that hard to do
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.960]   if you can get the phone out of your life
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.920]   as a default source of distraction.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.800]   So that's what I would recommend.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.760]   Get that phone plugged in by your front door
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.800]   when you get home.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.840]   If you need it, you can go near the front door,
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.880]   pick up the plugged-in phone to look something up.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.320]   It's now no longer a default distraction.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.480]   Always have a book with you you're excited to read.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.840]   You'll be surprised at how quickly you will get things done.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.520]   Within a short amount of time,
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.280]   you'll be reading five books a month.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.640]   And of course, if you stick with it,
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.780]   you'll be reading five books a day.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.100]   Right, Jesse, that's where we wanna end up.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.300]   Get rid of your phone, you'll be reading five books a day.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.540]   But only if you,
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.820]   we should have a product built around that, Jesse.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.460]   My Cal's course for reading five books a day.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.260]   - It'd be like that scene in "Short Circuit"
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.020]   when he was reading all the encyclopedias.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.900]   - That's a deep pull.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.580]   A "Short Circuit" reference, I like it.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.800]   - I remember that movie, yeah.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.020]   - What's the name of that actor?
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:58.000]   He was also in "Police Academy", the non-robot actor.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.500]   - I don't remember the robot.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.340]   - Johnny Five?
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.100]   Is that the robot?
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:05.920]   Am I thinking the right one?
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.140]   Johnny Five, Johnny Five is alive?
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.620]   - Maybe, I just remember the scene
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.660]   when he was reading all the books.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.940]   Remember, he's like gathering all the information.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.980]   - Yeah, so basically what I'm offering you
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.180]   is you'll be like Johnny Five from "Short Circuit"
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.820]   and be able to read, just sit there and read encyclopedias.
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.660]   These are such millennial references.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.260]   (Jesse laughs)
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.580]   All right, here's what I wanna do before we...
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.980]   Oh, speaking of books,
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.380]   the final segment I wanna do today, Jesse,
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:34.460]   is books I read, so it's well-timed.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.380]   But before we get to that, I wanna do a quick case study.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.420]   I sometimes like to do these.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:41.220]   People send in case studies about their experience
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.420]   putting the type of things we talked about
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.540]   on this show into practice,
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.380]   and I like to share what they're actually experiencing.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.380]   So here's a case study I wanna read here.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.500]   I don't have a name with this one, it was anonymous,
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:53.860]   but I'm gonna read it to you now
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.900]   and then we'll talk about it briefly.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.180]   All right, so here's the case study.
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.260]   I'm working full-time as a grants manager
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.860]   at a mid-sized nonprofit.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.380]   I'm almost a year into the role
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:04.620]   and I have used all of your productivity tools
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.540]   and techniques to work an average of four hours a day.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:09.860]   Some days are more, some are less,
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.140]   but if I can control my day,
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:15.100]   I can get my work done in about four hours.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.900]   The great part of this is that working an average
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.860]   of four hours makes me better at my job.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:20.500]   I'm constantly optimizing workflows
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.020]   and trying to improve the quality of what I do.
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.340]   I use techniques from your book, "A World Without Email"
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.660]   to decrease the amount of unnecessary
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:30.340]   back and forth on email.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.300]   I also track my average weekly hours
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.740]   so I get immediate feedback if I'm on track.
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.420]   The result is my organization is on track
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.380]   to raise the most grant money in its history
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.900]   this calendar year,
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.260]   and I can use my extra four hours to my advantage.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.100]   I have a part-time job where I do consulting,
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.620]   coaching, and write a blog.
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.700]   I also have time to work out
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.860]   and enjoy meals with my wife and son.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.580]   Therefore, within the nine to five window,
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.900]   I can work a full-time role,
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.780]   do a phantom part-time job,
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.660]   work out, and spend time with my family.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.580]   The only downside is that I keep this to myself at my job
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.660]   because technically I'm supposed to be working
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.900]   all of those hours.
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.660]   I'm happy with the current setup, however.
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.220]   The key was I started thinking about this from my first day.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.500]   I was working more when I started,
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.620]   but as I refined my work,
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.580]   eventually I settled at four hours.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.620]   I think others can benefit from doing the same
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:20.780]   if they have the ability to do so in their own work.
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.380]   So I love this case study
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.820]   because I think it's a good response
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.620]   to a critique I often hear.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:31.820]   I often hear this critique
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.660]   that organizational or productivity thinking
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.620]   is all about just trying to squeeze out more work
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.380]   so that your employers can exploit you more,
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.780]   and you're more than just your labor,
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.460]   and we have to stop this discourse
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.740]   because it's making us think,
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.140]   it's turning us into machines.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.500]   But this shows the counter-reality.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.740]   Being in control of your time and obligations,
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.180]   actually understanding what's happening,
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.540]   understanding where your time is going,
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:59.700]   and then reacting to that,
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.460]   building processes or systems
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.340]   to get rid of the huge sources of distraction,
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.780]   to get rid of all the context shifting,
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:07.260]   to get things done more effectively.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.500]   It is not about how can I squeeze out more.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.740]   It is not about hustle culture.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.620]   It can be about, like we saw in this case study,
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:15.620]   making your work much more manageable.
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:17.980]   People ask me sometimes,
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.420]   how can you be a professor and write books and do podcasts?
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.780]   This is part of the answer.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:25.620]   If you are finding calm through control,
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.780]   in many different positions,
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.860]   you realize the amount of time required
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.340]   to do your work at a respectable level
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.740]   is much less than what other people are spending.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.740]   You are eliminating waste and frustration
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.000]   with a lot of these techniques,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.860]   much more than you're trying to squeeze out more work.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.220]   And we see in this case study, what was the result?
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.380]   They're doing good jobs.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.700]   This grant manager actually is on track
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.660]   to break the record for grants
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.960]   brought into their organizations.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.420]   He's doing a great job.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.260]   It only takes him four hours a day.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.340]   So during his workday,
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:59.060]   he can exercise, have lunch with his wife and kid.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.820]   He's working on a sort of side gig
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.260]   that's just important to him.
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.860]   If something went wrong in his life,
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.140]   let's say there was a health scare
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.140]   with a parent or his wife or something,
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:10.300]   he could easily just turn down that side gig
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.180]   and have hours every day that he could work
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.100]   or tend towards that.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.540]   He has this extreme flexibility.
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.420]   He could, as I would highly recommend
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.200]   that he should do during Halloween time,
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:23.700]   spend hours every day working on elaborate animatronics
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.260]   and making that one of the focuses of his life.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.460]   This to me sounds like an incredibly sustainable lifestyle.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.860]   Now there's two ways we can get here.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:32.860]   We can wait for there to be
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.280]   some sort of systemic top-down reform
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:39.420]   where we pass a law that reduces the work week down.
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.900]   It can only be three days
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:44.820]   or that we have to have some sort of universal income
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.860]   that allows you to only work a part-time job
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:47.700]   and still make in meets.
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.940]   And all this stuff might be possible
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:50.860]   and there might be good arguments for all this stuff.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.820]   But what is true about any one of these ideas
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.340]   is it's not gonna happen tomorrow,
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.640]   but you could do what he's doing starting tomorrow.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.100]   That this one thing that is in our control,
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.100]   taking advantage of the fact
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.560]   that everyone else around you, the norm,
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.460]   the norm is so incredibly inefficient
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.400]   that if you're one of the few people
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.960]   to actually find calm through control
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.280]   to control your obligations and time,
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.020]   there's these huge inefficiencies for you to eliminate
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.880]   and these huge advantages that you can extract right away.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.040]   And so I think it's important.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.080]   This productivity organizational thinking
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.640]   is not about squeezing out more work.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.000]   It's about how do you refine a humane
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.980]   and sustainable relationship to your work
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.100]   in an age where technology has pushed work
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.280]   into this frenzy, this potential frenzy
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.360]   of exhausting busyness.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.520]   And there is a lot that you can do right now
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.920]   to help try to push back against it.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.680]   So I think this is a great case study
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.240]   of the type of deep life that can be crafted
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.320]   on top of this layer of controlling your time,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.220]   controlling your time and obligations.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.960]   I like that, Jesse, four hours.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.440]   I bet a lot more people could be doing that.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.600]   It's not every job.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.160]   I think there's a lot of jobs.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.600]   A lot of jobs for four hours a day,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.120]   you could be crushing it
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.800]   and no one even realizes
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.440]   that you're building a 10 foot witch
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.840]   that has a broom motion that rotates realistically.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.680]   No one even knows.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.080]   They just assume you're up late,
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.880]   especially if you're not in an office,
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.280]   especially if the work is more results oriented
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.040]   and a little bit less performative.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.520]   So I like these case studies.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.320]   That always works. - Yeah, 100%.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.140]   - All right, so what we're gonna move on to
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.160]   is a final segment.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.920]   I wanna talk about the books I read.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.080]   God, I guess we're looking back to May,
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.600]   even though this is coming out at the end of June.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.060]   We always fall behind.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.160]   Before we get to that though,
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.500]   I wanna mention another sponsor
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.560]   that makes this show possible.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.940]   This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.240]   Now, I think this is important.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.600]   We talk a lot on the show
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.360]   about different buckets or areas of your life
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.640]   that you wanna think about and make deeper.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.000]   Well, one of those buckets or areas
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.160]   that you really should think about
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.120]   is actually your mental life.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:07.480]   If your mental life is struggling,
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.020]   if you're struggling, for example, with excess anxiety,
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.960]   if you're struggling with depression,
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.960]   if you're struggling with other types of thinking
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.780]   that is reducing the quality of your life,
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.640]   getting in the way of things that matter,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.400]   you could use help here.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.460]   And not just white knuckling it, but professional help.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.100]   Just like if your knee was hurting,
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.700]   you would say, "I'm gonna go see an orthopedist
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.820]   "to look at my knee and see why it is hurting."
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.820]   Just like if you didn't like your mile time,
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.720]   you say, "I wanna run faster,
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.160]   "I'm gonna go get a training regime
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.340]   "and work with a trainer to become a faster runner."
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.360]   If your mind is not operating the way
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.080]   that you would like it to operate,
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.900]   therapy can be that training.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.620]   Therapy can be that route to helping your mind
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.900]   get to that state of health
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.980]   that's gonna make everything else possible.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.140]   Now, the issue with therapy, of course,
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.900]   is that it's hard and confusing to find a therapist.
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.420]   A lot of them are busy, a lot of them are filled,
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.740]   especially if you're just looking for someone nearby.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.260]   You might not like the therapist you end up with
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.620]   and then it's sort of awkward
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.060]   because now you're going to this office
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.540]   and how do you change this?
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:19.580]   BetterHelp is here to help make all of that easier.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.420]   It's entirely online,
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.320]   it's designed to be convenient, flexible,
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.780]   and suited to your schedule.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.500]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.860]   and you'll get matched with a licensed therapist.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.840]   And because it's online, you can switch therapist
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.620]   at any time for no additional charge.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.380]   So if the therapist you're working with isn't quite right,
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:35.900]   you can switch to someone else.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.660]   I personally know people who have used BetterHelp
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.380]   for very specific issues
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.300]   and maybe they switch once or twice
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.660]   and then they find this great match.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:44.620]   And because it's online,
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.060]   they're able to draw from therapists
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.300]   who are all around the country, right?
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.060]   And they can find this really good match,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.620]   it's incredibly convenient,
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.680]   and they're able to work on exactly that issue,
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.140]   work exactly on their thought patterns,
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.180]   get somewhere that is more healthy for them.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:01.820]   So to find more balance with BetterHelp,

[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:18.220]   All right, I also wanna talk about
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:22.900]   our good friends at Hinson Shaving.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.780]   This is the razor that I use.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.620]   It is the razor that I recommend you use as well.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.260]   Here's the idea behind the Hinson Shaving experience.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.220]   They put their expertise into the production
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:41.220]   of this beautiful precision milled aluminum razor.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:45.760]   They use aerospace grade CNC machines
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.040]   to make these metal razors set up
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.040]   so that the blade extends just 0.0013 inches past the edge.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.060]   That's less than the thickness of a human hair.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.820]   This means a secure and stable blade
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.020]   with a vibration-free shave.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.260]   It's a clog-free design
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.820]   because that's so perfectly aligned.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.380]   You don't get the diving board effect
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.720]   where the blade moves up and down,
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.420]   which can create nicks or cuts or scrapes.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.500]   So they use precision in the design of the razor
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.380]   to give you a very good shave.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.260]   Now, what makes this really cool
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.940]   is that then when it comes to blades,
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.240]   you can just use a standard 10 cent safety razor blade.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.940]   All of the smarts, all of the engineering
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.100]   is in the razor itself.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.260]   So you pay a little bit more for the razor up front,
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.300]   but then it is incredibly cheap to operate going forward
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.580]   because all you have to replace are these 10 cent blades.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.220]   So it does not take long
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.660]   before the experience of Hinson Shaving is cheaper
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.080]   than a monthly subscription service.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.060]   It doesn't take long before the experience of shaving
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.140]   with a Hinson razor is cheaper
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.740]   than buying those really expensive
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.900]   over-packaged disposable blades from the drugstore.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.980]   So it is the razor I use.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.500]   It's beautifully engineered.
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.840]   I love great tools, built really well,
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.800]   that solve a purpose and can last for a really long time.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.980]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.620]   and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:14.340]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:16.260]   and use that code CAL,
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.740]   and you'll get two years worth of blades free
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.580]   with your razor.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.980]   Just make sure to add them to your cart.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.540]   So you add the blades to your cart,
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.740]   and then when you use the code CAL,
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.980]   the price of them will drop back to zero.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.620]   So that's 100 free blades
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.620]   when you head to h-e-n-s-o-n-s-h-a-v-i-n-g.com/cal
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:38.620]   and make sure to use that promo code CAL.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:44.500]   All right, so let's talk about the books I read in May.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.300]   I had to put on my memory hat here.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.580]   That was a while ago, but I went back.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:52.140]   Actually, Jesse, you'll be impressed by this.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.740]   There's a long running joke in the studio
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.020]   where whenever it's a week
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.940]   that we are going to record the books I read,
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.620]   I always forget to bring my list of books I read
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.580]   to the studio, which is down the street from my house.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.920]   Well, this time I packed that list with me in my bags,
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.640]   and I brought it to New Hampshire.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.860]   I have my official list with me.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.060]   My May books are on there.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.380]   My June books are on there.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.580]   I'm adding July books to it now as well.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.300]   So you are probably impressed, Jesse.
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.260]   I hope you're impressed
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.940]   that I actually have my list of books,
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.580]   even though I'm hundreds of miles from home.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.420]   - Very organized.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:26.840]   - That's the way to do it.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.940]   All right, so what did I read in May 2023?
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.620]   Book number one, "The Soul of a New Machine"
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.900]   by Tracy Kidder.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.620]   This is a book from the 1980s.
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:43.780]   Tracy embedded himself in a microcomputer,
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:45.960]   or I guess it was a minicomputer manufacturer.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.860]   Minicomputers are not really a thing anymore,
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.780]   but these were a big deal for a while.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:52.640]   These were computers that were less powerful
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.580]   than a mainframe, but more powerful
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.140]   than a personal computer running off a microprocessor.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.700]   And so these minicomputers,
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.260]   which were in between these two things,
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.520]   were really big.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.360]   They were big, and companies would buy them.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.840]   You would buy them often through what was called an OEM.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.380]   So there would be these third parties
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:13.060]   that you would say, "Here's what I need to do,"
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.500]   from a computational perspective.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.420]   And then they would build a custom package for you.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:20.060]   They would buy these minicomputers and set it up
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.460]   and set it up perfectly for your business.
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.020]   This was big business for a while.
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.340]   Anyways, Tracy Kidder embedded himself
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.300]   in one of these companies to document the creation
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.920]   of a new minicomputer.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.360]   And his whole point was to try to encapsulate in a book
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.340]   the feel of these technology companies,
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.260]   these sort of new Silicon Valley,
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.940]   though this one was not based in Silicon Valley,
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.180]   but these new Silicon Valley ethic infused,
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.900]   venture capital backed, super fast working,
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.940]   move fast and break stuff, stay up all night
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.620]   to try to get the product out.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:51.940]   This was very new in the '80s,
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:55.060]   and he wanted to capture it in a book, and he did so.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.340]   This is a, it's a famous book
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.300]   in the history of technology writing.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.700]   I believe it won the Pulitzer Prize.
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.540]   I believe it won the National Book Award.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.860]   It was a highly-fetted book,
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.000]   and you'll see why if you read it.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.740]   It's just a really well-constructed profile
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.780]   that captures what it was like
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:13.580]   to be in one of these tech companies during that period.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.360]   All right, the next book I read was "Conscious"
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.360]   by Annika Harris, who I believe is Sam Harris's wife.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.580]   So "Conscious," it's a short book.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.420]   It's really cool, though.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.240]   I like this type of book.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.420]   It just tackles directly the question,
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.460]   what do we know about consciousness?
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.980]   And where does consciousness come from?
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.320]   What are the different theories about where it comes from?
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.980]   And she just goes through it.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.600]   Here we go, boom, boom, boom, without dwelling too long.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.400]   And you come out of it with a,
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.160]   I think where she's successful
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.680]   is a really good understanding of the major rifts
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.320]   in the field of those who study consciousness.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.680]   There's these big schools of thought.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.720]   Some of them are more prominent than others.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.800]   And you get a pretty good feel for that landscape.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.080]   So I actually read this book as a background
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.600]   to the writing I've been doing recently,
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.720]   especially for "The New Yorker"
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.320]   about artificial intelligence.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.700]   And I really wanted to brush up on my understanding
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.400]   of what we know about consciousness.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.640]   I was thinking forward to machine consciousness.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.040]   So this was a good primer.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.280]   I wish there was more books like this.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.880]   Deep topic tackled by really smart scientists
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.760]   and a book that can deliver you the lay of the land.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.120]   And it can do so in 150 pages.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.720]   It's a cool book.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.040]   Next one, this is kind of weird.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:30.880]   This is a health book,
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.520]   "A Statin-Free Life" by Asim Malhotra.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.080]   This is just me being in my 40s
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.720]   and worrying about my heart
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.720]   and reading about lifestyle, food, exercise, heart stuff.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.600]   So there's nothing exciting intellectually about this.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.960]   This is just someone who comes
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.080]   from a family with heart disease.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.520]   So there we go.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.480]   Keep your heart healthy.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.920]   All right, this next book I'm gonna recommend,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.040]   though I'm not sure I'm gonna recommend
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:10:59.960]   that you go try to read it
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.000]   because it's incredibly hard to find.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.160]   "The Life Cycle of Software Objects."
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.680]   It's a novella by Ted Chiang,
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.520]   who of course is a fantastic science fiction
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.600]   short story writer.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.040]   Now, this book was recommended to me by one of my editors.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.640]   I really wanted to read it because again,
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.840]   I'm thinking some about artificial intelligence
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.920]   and machine consciousness.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   It is a really cool Ted Chiang,
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.600]   classic Chiang style novella about artificial intelligence.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.400]   It posits a world in which you develop
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.240]   these artificially intelligent digital agents,
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.800]   but you teach them.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.240]   So instead of the training be something that happens
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.440]   in a week offline in a big data center,
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.200]   it posits a world where you essentially raise,
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.360]   you have people raise these digital agents
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.760]   in a virtual world.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.840]   And through interaction with humans,
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.280]   these digital agents learn about language and emotion.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.080]   So it's an interesting thought experiment.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.160]   Maybe it's easier to build a digital brain
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.920]   capable of learning,
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.320]   and then you teach it
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.880]   like you would teach an actual human kid.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.440]   And then it goes into sort of dark places
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.800]   because what do you, you know, these things,
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.200]   it's like they're your kids.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.120]   And then at some point the technology becomes obsolete
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.360]   and to just turn off the computers would be like
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.240]   essentially putting an end to this particular consciousness.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.680]   And it all sorts of in very Chang style,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.240]   he follows through the implications in interesting places.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.200]   The issue about this is really hard to find.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.160]   He published this with a specialty press.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.200]   It's a beautiful two color print
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.920]   and he published it with a specialty press,
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.120]   relatively limited run, and that's it.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.080]   So it's not available in Amazon warehouses.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.160]   It's not available in Kindle or on Audible.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.320]   You have to find one on the secondary market.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.040]   I mean, this is probably an example.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:55.040]   Jesse and I used to do a segment called Deep.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.600]   What was it, Deep or Strange?
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.560]   What was the other option, Jesse?
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.360]   It was like Deep or Crazy, something like that.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.240]   Like is this thing I did admirably deep
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.760]   or concerningly crazy?
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.360]   And I think the effort I went through to acquire this book
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.680]   could be used for that segment.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.320]   I don't wanna say how much I paid for it,
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.680]   but I will just say the number of digits involved
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.600]   was more than two.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.880]   And so this might be an example of Deep or Crazy.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.840]   So this is why I'm not really recommending
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.640]   everyone go out and find this book.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.560]   But if you do come across a copy in a used bookstore,
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.480]   definitely read it.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.520]   I'm a big Ted Chiang fan and I think it's really cool.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.360]   How do you judge that, Jesse?
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.440]   Is that Deep or Crazy?
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:40.120]   - Is it above two or just above two is not crazy?
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:40.960]   That's Deep.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.200]   - Yeah, three, three figures.
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.360]   - It's above three figures?
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.200]   - No, it's not above three figures.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.960]   - All right, so wrap. - It's in three figures.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.080]   - That's Deep.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.160]   - Okay, we'll call that Deep.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.800]   Four figures is crazy. - It's not crazy.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.200]   - All right, four figures is crazy.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.520]   Three figures, Deep.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.960]   We agree with that?
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:57.880]   - Well, you could always, I mean,
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.480]   now that you've read it, you could always sell it.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.320]   - No. - That's cool.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.840]   - You're probably keeping it in your library.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.360]   - I'm gonna keep it in my library.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.320]   It's a really cool book.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   All right, final book I read.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.400]   This is also a curve ball.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.880]   It was called A Book of Life.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.720]   This thing was a beast.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.240]   500 words by Michael Strassfeld.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.940]   A complete survey of Jewish theology.
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.560]   So a rabbi friend-- - 500 words, 500 pages.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:30.320]   - Yeah, it's a rabbi friend of, what was that?
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.840]   - You said 500 words, 500 pages, right?
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.320]   - That's right, yeah, 500 words.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.920]   That would be selling Jewish theology a little short.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.200]   There was Moses-- - Hey, 500 word books,
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.120]   you could easily read five in a day.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.960]   - That's how I read five books a day,
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.320]   is they're all 500 word books.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.960]   Yeah, this book was, yeah, there's Noah, Moses,
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.720]   yada, yada, yada, Deuteronomy, yada, yada, yada,
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.760]   prophets, judges, you get the gist.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.600]   A rabbi friend loaned it to me.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.280]   And I was like, okay, I like understanding religion.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.440]   People know I like religion.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.560]   So I read it, it's cool, it's interesting.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.560]   So I now know some, I now know some about Jewish theology.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.960]   All right, so those were my books for May 2023.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.480]   I brought a bunch of books up with me to Hanover,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.880]   so I'm excited to keep reading.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.320]   There's a couple bookstores I'm looking forward
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   to visiting here as well.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.760]   So keep the reading going,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.480]   and I will remember to do this update next month as well.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.480]   All right, Jesse, I think we should wrap it up here.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.380]   I think we, hopefully this was successful,
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:43.640]   our first sort of deep HQ North recording of the podcast.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.800]   Again, if you're watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.560]   watch how the quality of my setup here
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.880]   hopefully is going to improve with each passing week,
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.200]   because I think that's a fun challenge,
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.360]   a fun engineering challenge.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.920]   Maybe I'll assign my students, Jesse.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.880]   I'll say, this is their assignment.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.080]   How good can you make my podcast studio?
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.120]   And just make them come and run the studio
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.640]   and hold the boom mics, and it'll be great.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.960]   Your grade is 50% dependent on the viewer numbers
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.080]   of my podcast for the next three weeks.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.160]   But one way or the other, it's gonna look--
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.720]   - And write a compelling piece describing it, the ordeal,
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.520]   'cause aren't you teaching a writing class?
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.560]   - That's true, they could write about it.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.220]   Actually, they should just write my question answers.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:24.360]   So they're gonna write all my segments for me and run it,
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.320]   and also make sure my coffee is fresh.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.280]   Yeah, this is what you do.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.880]   This is the right way to be a professor.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.800]   All right, well, let's wrap this up, Jesse.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.960]   Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.120]   I'll be back next week with another episode
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.780]   recorded up here from my northern headquarters.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:42.200]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.620]   (upbeat music)
