[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.500]   On Monday, we took a look at what distinguishes our lives from the lives of non-Christians
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.500]   around us.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.240]   There, in APJ 1858, we touched on spiritual gifts a little bit, and then in the episode
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.080]   before that, we asked, "What are my skills worth?"
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.760]   That was APJ 1857, which was a fascinating discussion because in many churches, you have
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.560]   a doctor, a lawyer, a plumber, a carpenter, an auto mechanic, someone who makes money
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.360]   from their skills.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.080]   Sometimes those skills can be exploited by people in the local church for free.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.200]   Maybe you've experienced that very thing yourself.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.000]   The conclusion was, "Be willing to pay for the service," Piper said, "and if the skilled
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.960]   person wants to make a special gift to you, that's his or her to decide, not yours to
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   expect."
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.000]   It's a good summary.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.520]   If skilled Christians in the church share the same skills you will find among non-Christians
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.880]   outside the church, what makes a spiritual gift spiritual?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.240]   Because as we'll hear today, many unbelievers have great abilities, abilities to lead and
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.480]   administrate and teach, but those gifts are not automatically spiritual gifts, obviously.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.560]   What makes a spiritual gift spiritual?
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.280]   In a sermon, Pastor John turned to Paul's testimony in Romans 1 for the answer.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.560]   There Paul writes, "For I long to see you, the church in Rome, that I may impart to you
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.640]   some spiritual gift to strengthen you, that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.240]   each other's faith, both yours and mine."
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.000]   That's Romans 1 verses 11 to 12.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.440]   Here's Pastor John to unpack it and to apply it.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.040]   So the basic problem is becoming the kind of person who wakes up in the morning and
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.760]   thanks God for life and for salvation and then says, "Lord, oh, how I want to strengthen
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.800]   people's faith today at work.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.840]   Lord, let me come to the end of this day and be able to look back and say, 'Somebody
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.680]   has more confidence in your promises today because I crossed their path.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.000]   Somebody is more happy in your grace because I crossed their path.'"
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.760]   That's the main problem, waking up and being that kind of person.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.360]   The reason I say that's the basic problem and not the discovery of spiritual gifts is
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.080]   because if there were 550 people in this church waking up and saying that and praying
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.600]   that and meaning that, the Holy Spirit would not leave you frustrated in finding ways to
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   do that.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.800]   He will not let a person whose heart is earnestly desirous of building other people up go without
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.920]   building them up.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.120]   He will help you find those ways and the finding of those ways will be the discovering of your
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120]   gifts.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.440]   It doesn't matter whether you can find a name for it or not.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:25.040]   So let's apply ourselves to becoming the kind of people who more and more long to build
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.720]   up each other's faith, to make each other happier in the Lord, to make each other more
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.560]   confident in his promises.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.280]   Now next verse, really interesting insights that come from comparing these two verses.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.240]   Verse 12, Paul restates verse 11 in different words.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.560]   That's what you do when you start a sentence with "that is."
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   You're restating what you just said.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.840]   I want to strengthen you by my spiritual gift.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:01.080]   That is, I want us to mutually encourage or be mutually encouraged by each other's faith,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.280]   both yours and mine.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.680]   Now Paul does two things here.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.960]   This is really interesting.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.480]   The first thing he does is the old "it's my pleasure" tactic.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.680]   You remember that sermon back in the fall that I preached called "It's My Pleasure,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.080]   Christian Hedonism and Humility."
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.320]   Paul is doing that right here.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.720]   Notice, when we say, "Oh, it's my pleasure," after we do a benefit for somebody, a favor,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200]   what we're doing is trying to be humble.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.760]   We're saying, "Well, don't get too worked up about my self-sacrifice because I just did
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.360]   what I wanted to do."
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.440]   So you cut off too much praise.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.760]   You try to humble yourself after having done a good deed.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.000]   Now that's what Paul is doing here, I think.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.240]   Paul re-reads verse 11.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.640]   He says, "Hmm, I sure don't want to give the impression that I'm coming on strong there
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.040]   as the great benefactor who's going to do them all this good and get no benefit."
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.920]   So he backs off and he restates his goal to say, "It's going to be two-way street in Rome.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.040]   I'm going to get encouraged and you're going to get encouraged.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.880]   It's my pleasure.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.160]   Don't give me too much praise.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.800]   I'm just doing what I like to do when I go around preaching and get encouraged by other
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.840]   people's faith as well as encouraging them."
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.960]   That's the first thing he does in this text.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.360]   Now the second thing he does is to show that the way he's going to strengthen their faith
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.640]   by using his spiritual gift is by encouraging them with his faith.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.680]   Now notice the parallel between the two verses.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.040]   In verse 11, he aims to strengthen them.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.600]   In verse 12, he aims to encourage them.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.840]   So those two words are parallel.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.040]   In verse 11, he aims to strengthen them by his spiritual gift.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.560]   In verse 12, he aims to encourage them by his faith.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:07.200]   Now I think you can draw the conclusion, therefore, this definition of spiritual gifts.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:15.320]   A spiritual gift is an expression of faith that aims to strengthen faith.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.800]   Wouldn't that be a fair definition, having put those two verses together and seeing that
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.840]   verse 12 is an explanation of verse 11?
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:35.320]   A spiritual gift is activated by faith and aims to produce more faith in another person.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.000]   Or another way to put it would be this.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.080]   A spiritual gift is an ability given by the Holy Spirit to express our faith effectively
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.600]   for the up-building of another's faith.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.760]   That's what a spiritual gift is, I think, from these two verses.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:02.560]   Now that to me is very helpful because it helps me distinguish and keep separate natural
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.040]   abilities and spiritual gifts.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.640]   They aren't the same.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:17.720]   Many, many unbelievers have great abilities—administration, teaching, for example, to name a couple.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.840]   And these are given by God.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.520]   He has what he has from God, whether they acknowledge it or not.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.560]   But they're not spiritual gifts in the New Testament sense, are they?
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.920]   Why?
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.600]   Because they do not come from faith, they're not expressions of faith, and they're not
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.240]   aiming to strengthen faith.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.440]   Our faith is the channel through which the Holy Spirit flows on his way to building up
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.680]   another person's faith.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.560]   And therefore, for any ability that we have to be a channel for the Spirit and therefore
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:04.600]   spiritual, it has to flow from faith in him and aim towards faith in another person.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:12.720]   So no matter what abilities we have, if we're not relying on God—that is, having faith—and
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.120]   we're not aiming to help others rely on God, produce faith, our ability is not spiritual.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:26.480]   It's not a spiritual gift because the Holy Spirit is not flowing through it from faith
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.000]   to faith.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.320]   Now, that has tremendous implications for a church in the selection of its staff, the
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   choice of its officers, and its board members.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:47.680]   The implication is this, it means that we will never simply say, "Who has the ability
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.600]   to efficiently do this job?"
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   Never.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.460]   That's a wholly inadequate criterion for determining a person's suitability for staff
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.640]   or for office in the church.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:12.040]   We will go on and ask, "Does this person use his skill or her ability to express their
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.920]   lively and hearty dependence on the Lord?"
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:27.060]   And we will ask, "Does the exercise of that skill aim always to be helping other people
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.920]   believe more, or does the way they go about doing their work always manage to put people
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:41.680]   down or make people feel unbelieving rather than believing?"
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:48.600]   A church where the Holy Spirit is alive and powerful will always be sensitive to the difference
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.400]   between natural abilities and spiritual gifts.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:10:00.880]   So good, a spiritual gift is an expression of faith that aims to strengthen faith.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   That's helpful.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.720]   This clip was taken from John Piper's message on spiritual gifts, simply titled "Spiritual
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.560]   Gifts," and preached on March 15, 1981.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.920]   The whole message is online.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.440]   Have a sermon clip for me?
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   Send me an email.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.160]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.960]   the audio, and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.840]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.280]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.400]   Well speaking of spiritual gifts, what do we do when we don't have one?
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.720]   Or we don't think we have one?
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.240]   What are some practical steps to finding our spiritual gifts?
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.800]   Pastor John will explain next time.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.920]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   [END]
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   1. What are some practical steps to finding your spiritual gifts?
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.320]   2. What are some practical steps to finding your spiritual gifts?
