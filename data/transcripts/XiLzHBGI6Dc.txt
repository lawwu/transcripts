[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   Well, in our culture, every sexual orientation gets a label and a definition.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.920]   A 26-year-old anonymous female listener has been considering those categories, and she
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.600]   writes in to us.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.240]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.960]   What are your thoughts on the sexual orientation category of asexual, of people who experience
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.760]   no general sexual attraction to others?
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.240]   This seems to be me currently.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240]   Am I broken?
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.240]   Is something wrong with me?
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.380]   Or do you think in the Christian life this would be a God-given signal that one has the
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.560]   permanent gift of singleness?
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.040]   At first I thought so.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.240]   But then I see another category for those who are demisexual, those who experience
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.680]   sexual attraction to someone but only after a close emotional connection has first been
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680]   formed.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.840]   I think I may be asexual, but I don't know.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.640]   Perhaps I could be sexually attracted to a man later on.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.840]   In light of 1 Corinthians 7, verses 6-11, does the Bible applaud asexuality?
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.960]   And how should a currently asexual young woman proceed in thinking about singleness and marriage
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.800]   that embraces singleness and ministry opportunities but leaves open the possibility of marriage
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   in the future?"
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.120]   Pastor John, what would you say to this young female listener?
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.360]   You know, I hadn't planned to say this, but yesterday I took a walk with my wife, and
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.640]   I said, "Hey, I've been thinking about some APJ questions," and I paraphrased this one
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.360]   to her about a woman who thought she had no sexual attraction to men as a single woman.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.840]   And my wife looked at me and said, "What's the problem?"
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.520]   I said, "Okay, I'll tell her you said that."
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.200]   So that response might make a little more sense if I tell you what I was going to say
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.440]   anyway, but there it is.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.640]   That's a short answer.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.880]   It might be helpful to start by saying that the vast majority of marriages in the history
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.920]   of the world have not been based on romantic sexual attraction.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120]   That's a relatively modern criterion.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.800]   In a way, it has skyrocketed to preeminence in the last couple centuries in the West.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.180]   Most of the marriages in the world have been arranged by family or have been dictated by
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.520]   other relational and social circumstances.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.760]   So just be aware that we live in a weird time with the elevation of personal romantic affection
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.800]   being the be-all and end-all of how you form lifelong relationships of commitment, which
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:36.720]   also means that millions of human beings have been born into the world having been conceived
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.800]   in moments not of mutual sexual passion.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.640]   Most human beings have come into the world not having been conceived that way.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.680]   That kind of passion may or may not have come into being in a marriage, but it doesn't take
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.900]   passion to make a baby.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:09.080]   To be sure, God has lots to say in the Bible about how a male and a female human being,
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.560]   created in His image, should treat each other with respect and honor and purity in the unique
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.200]   callings of manhood and womanhood in the act of sexual relations.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.800]   I'm not saying those aren't important and that God has nothing to say about it, but He
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:39.000]   does not say that the only valid sexual relations—sexual intercourse—the only valid sexual relations
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.960]   or the only beautiful sexual relations must carry the same mutual passions in a man and
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   a woman.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.680]   Like, they both got to be fever pitch intense for this thing to be right and beautiful.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.440]   That's not true.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:05.080]   Those passions vary tremendously from man to man, woman to woman, from season to season
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.920]   in a marriage relationship.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.560]   They're just not of the essence.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400]   They are not of the essence of what marriage is.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.840]   It's not an accident that the very first chapter in my book on marriage is titled "Staying
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.560]   Married is Not About Staying in Love."
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.240]   That's the way I began my book on marriage.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.680]   I wrote it when we'd been married 40 years; I would say the same thing now we've been
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.280]   married 50 years.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:41.920]   I think being in love in the romantic sense of mutual desire is indeed the ideal of God's
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:52.040]   plan, but it is neither essential nor is it the primary means of staying married or staying
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.920]   happily married.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:03.880]   There are far bigger issues at stake in marriage than being or staying in love.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.280]   Marriage is about the covenant-keeping love between Christ and the Church, and displaying
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:20.480]   that can happen profoundly even where romantic affections rise and fall, maybe especially
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.680]   when romantic affections fall.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.800]   Number two, second observation.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:36.680]   From what you have told me, I don't see your relative indifference to sex as a flaw.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:46.080]   Now, getting back to Noel's reaction, I would need to know lots more to make a judgment
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   like that.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.280]   My guess is that you—I asked my wife whether she would say this.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   She said, "Sure."
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:02.960]   I said, "My guess is that you are closer to the norm of how women feel about sex in
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:13.840]   general than the sexually spring-loaded and predacious women glorified as normative in
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:22.360]   the entertainment industry, which, by the way, are almost all created by men who are
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.680]   always dreaming unrealistic things about women."
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.800]   So here's a key question for you.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.280]   Can you imagine yourself spending the rest of your life living with a caring, mature,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:46.080]   responsible Christian man, and do you have any desire for that to happen?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   Another question.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.920]   Do you ever dream about this?
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.000]   Did you, when you were a teenager, ever dream about this?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.800]   Or would you just as soon have an ordinary home of your own, maybe a housemate, maybe
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.760]   not, for the next 50 years, and you could very happily conceive of things that way?
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.680]   None of those is judgment questions.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.400]   They're just knowing yourself kinds of questions.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.440]   If you say, "No, I don't dream about spending my life with a man," then my question would
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:27.320]   be, just to clarify, has any man, real or imaginary, ever wakened such a longing in
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   you?
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.200]   Do sexual relations seem unclean to you when you imagine having sex?
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200]   Does it seem gross?
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.520]   Now, you may wonder, "Why were you asking that question?"
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.560]   I'm asking that question because I've dealt with couples.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.760]   I'm thinking of one in particular that divorced within a year after I did their wedding, and
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.320]   she simply said, "It's just gross.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   I can't stand it.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   It's gross."
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:58.560]   So she clearly walked into this thinking that she didn't know what she was in for and had
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.920]   a horrific issue to deal with from her past that she hadn't come to terms with.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.560]   Or does it seem boring?
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.920]   Does it seem frightening?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.040]   Does a sexual relationship with a man seem beautiful?
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.720]   Does it seem godly?
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.320]   Does it seem like a necessary evil for making babies?
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:25.840]   And I just want, in that conversation, to discern just what is your inner heart world,
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.000]   what's really going on in your heart.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.320]   It would make a huge difference whether you thought sex would feel dirty or whether you
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:43.840]   thought it would simply be a godly way to bless your husband, even though you yourself
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.200]   didn't have any passionate pursuit of it.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.520]   Maybe one story from my experience and a closing encouragement.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:03.080]   When I was madly in love with Noelle in college and desired everything about her, sexually
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.040]   and every other way I wanted her, fully expected to marry her, which I eventually did, there
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:16.840]   was another young woman about a year into our relationship, about her age, same age,
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.720]   that I felt no sexual attraction to at all.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:30.040]   But this young woman was a poet, and I was writing poems, lots of them in those days,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:38.680]   and she liked my poems that I wrote, and she gave me some of hers.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:47.240]   This created in me something that you might—I'm talking to you now—you might perhaps experience.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.400]   I was deeply moved.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.840]   She touched something deep inside of me that she appreciated what I wrote, shared what
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.920]   she wrote.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.000]   I was drawn to her.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I was drawn to her.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.600]   I wanted to spend time with her.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.560]   I thought she was quite homely.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.360]   I was drawn to her.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.400]   It was not sexual.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.920]   I didn't even think she was pretty, but it was deeper than that.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.080]   I had to stop talking with her.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:26.480]   I had to stop reading her poems for a season and sharing mine.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.440]   Something was going on inside of me that was profoundly bonding.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.040]   And now here's my point.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.900]   You might experience something like that.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:45.940]   If Noelle had not existed, would that relationship have moved toward romance?
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:54.480]   Would I have been eventually desirous of her body as I was of her kinship in poetry?
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.720]   And I don't know the answer to that.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:02.000]   I don't know, but I felt like it was very possible.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.120]   So my encouragement is, accept your present indifference to sexual desires.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   Just accept it.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.160]   Like Noelle said, what's the problem?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.640]   Seek to love and serve people with all your gifts.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.440]   Be joyful in the Lord and mature and wise and strong and humble and honest.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.760]   Be a great, mature, deep sage of a woman.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.080]   Don't go out of your way to make relationships happen.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:44.280]   But if a worthy man shows an interest in you, go with it in all purity until it's plain
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:52.240]   that there is or there isn't a sense of desire or a sense of calling to spend your life with
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.960]   him in a growing intimacy of every kind.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.920]   Seek delight in Christ, serving him and in serving others.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   The life of faith looks similar to us all.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.880]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.640]   And to all of you who wrestle with singleness and marriage, thank you for listening along
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   and for subscribing to Ask Pastor John in your favorite podcast app or YouTube.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.640]   We really appreciate having you along for the ride.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.240]   Next time we look at really what is the most important key in our victory over sin, it's
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.320]   hard to overstate what we're going to look at next time.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.800]   We will see you on Wednesday.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.320]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.680]   [end]
