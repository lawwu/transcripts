[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   Should we pray with a few words or should we pray with many words?
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.500]   Solomon the wise tells us to pray with just a few words
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.560]   and Jesus himself teaches us to pray with only a few words as well, but Paul
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   tells us to pray
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.760]   without ever stopping. And now Luke Barnes is confused.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.320]   Luke writes in to ask this, "Hello Pastor John, Jesus and Solomon warn us about using
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.960]   many words in prayer before God, however Paul commands us to pray without ceasing.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.900]   How do these two truths work together?"
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.960]   Right, we talked about
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.900]   what it means to pray without ceasing I think back in
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.060]   episode 933 if I looked it up
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.520]   right, but Luke has a twist
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.620]   that he puts on the question that we didn't talk about
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.080]   there, namely he's asking how can
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.200]   praying without ceasing fit together
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.760]   with keeping our words few
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.920]   in the presence of God.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.440]   And let me just say in passing that I think this kind of question
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.320]   if asked humbly and
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.840]   eagerly with the expectation that there is a good God-honoring
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.480]   answer in Scripture, I think asking that kind of question is one of the
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.080]   most valuable practical kinds of questions you can ask because
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.920]   when you try to answer a question
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.520]   like this, it reveals the
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.960]   measure or lack of measure
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.640]   of your understanding of the two verses you're trying to
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.360]   fit together and it forces you to go
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.080]   deeper. If you take each verse
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.200]   by itself and don't think
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.240]   of the other, you may get some measure of insight
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.840]   but when you take the two together
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.120]   it forces you to ask questions and to dig
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.600]   deeper so that you realize
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.720]   what you had been seeing when you just looked at one of the verses may be only
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.440]   part
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.600]   of the picture. So when it comes to understanding Scripture and going deep
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.440]   with God
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.840]   I would encourage people in all humility
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.480]   and with high expectation in God's wisdom and trustworthiness
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.720]   to ask these kinds of questions. How can this verse
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.960]   and this verse fit together? That's been one of the
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.560]   consistent ways that I've tried to go deep with God over
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.680]   the years. So Luke mentions Ecclesiastes
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.120]   I think he's referring to chapter 5 verses 2 and 3 where it says
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.360]   "Be not rash with your mouth
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.120]   nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.280]   for God is in heaven and you are on
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.000]   earth therefore let your words be few
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.200]   for a dream comes with much business and a fool's voice with many
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.280]   words." And some of us, I mean
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.680]   when he said this I thought immediately not of Ecclesiastes but of Jesus'
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.640]   words in Matthew 6, 7, and 8 where he says when you pray
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.800]   don't heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.200]   for they think they'll be heard for their
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.120]   many words. Do not be like them
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.480]   for your father knows what you need before you ask him.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   And then over against those texts
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.960]   Luke wonders how they fit together with verse Thessalonians
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.920]   5, 17 "Pray without
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.760]   ceasing," which sounds like wow that's a lot of
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.640]   talking. Now one of the ways to get insight
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.560]   into whether or not a perceived tension
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.360]   is in fact a contradiction is to try to think
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.400]   of an analogy, a related
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.680]   or similar kind of situation in which
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.520]   the tension, while similar, would not be
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.360]   a contradiction. The one that I thought of goes like this
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.200]   I might encourage you something like this
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.120]   "Greet everyone you meet graciously." Never stop
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.760]   greeting strangers but make sure your greetings are
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   brief and genuine. So the point there would be that
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.040]   ceaseless greetings means
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.120]   keep on doing it, don't leave anybody out,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.680]   don't get weary in it, don't cease to be a gracious
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.360]   outgoing person. And in that sense
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.480]   you might think my my that's a lot of words all day long greeting all those
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.080]   people and yet I said
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.120]   let your greetings be brief
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.560]   and authentic. Now might
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.520]   the biblical exhortation to come to God without ceasing in prayer
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.760]   and yet not to be wordy in your prayers, might that be a similar kind of
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.640]   situation
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.360]   and therefore not be a contradiction? And I suppose it
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.160]   it really does hang on how you
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.640]   understand pray without ceasing.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.160]   If it means that every second of every day
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.520]   you are consciously speaking words to God then
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.200]   the words would indeed have to be very very very
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.720]   very many. And I argued in episode
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.840]   93 that pray without ceasing means at least these three things. One,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.960]   have a continual spirit of dependency on God.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.000]   Two, pray repeatedly and often in every situation of need and thankfulness.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.120]   And three, don't ever come to the point where you give up and cease praying and
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.440]   say it's not working, I'm quitting, don't ever go there.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.880]   And I don't think that meaning of
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.880]   praying without ceasing contradicts
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.360]   the other teachings that our words should be
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.320]   thoughtful and not empty and to the point and succinct
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.400]   and not unnecessarily drawn out.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.480]   So basically I think what what the warning against many words
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   is doing is protecting us from thinking we can
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.600]   twist God's arm by repetitions
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.160]   as though saying something five times would be more compelling
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   than one heartfelt authentic request that leaves the matter with him
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.240]   and moves forward in faith. God is not
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.880]   hard of hearing and he's not reluctant to bless
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.360]   his children. And of course
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.440]   that conclusion doesn't say anything about
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.040]   how much time we spend in prayer because
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.200]   there are so many different things to bring to the Lord
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.560]   in prayer for ourselves, our families, our churches, our
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.120]   communities, our nation, our world, missions. There's so many things to bring
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.480]   to the Lord that if we expressed ourself with
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.040]   appropriate faith-filled brevity with each one, we'd
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.880]   still be praying a very long time and lingering in the
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.960]   presence of the Lord for goodness an hour or more.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.760]   So conclusion, yes, continually go
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.600]   to the Lord. Let's have a constant spirit of dependence on him. Let's never
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.800]   grow weary in asking and seeking and knocking.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.040]   But let's not fall into the trap of thinking that
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.680]   multiplying many words, multiplying phrases will get more out of God
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:59.640]   than to the point faith-filled requests. Amen. Or Spurgeon so famously told his
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.840]   friend, "I always feel it well to put a few words
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.080]   of prayer between everything I do." And I remember reading in his
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.000]   autobiography too that he said he
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.880]   treats prayer pretty businesslike and seldom spends more than 20 minutes or so
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.840]   at a time in prayer, if I remember reading correctly. Yeah,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.520]   that's what I heard too. It's always good to put a few words of Spurgeon into the
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.640]   end of an APJ episode as well. Thank you, Pastor John and Luke, thank you for the

[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.080]   be baptized for the dead? Are the Mormons on to
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.360]   something Paul mentions in 1 Corinthians 15-29?
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.760]   Or are the Mormons dead wrong? John Piper will give us his take on Friday when we
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.880]   return. I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John
