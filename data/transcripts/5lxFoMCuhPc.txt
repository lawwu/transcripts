[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.560]   Let me tell you about the gut-brain axis and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.040]   Insatiable for sugar and quenchable for fat.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:35.080]   And this is a story about the fundamental difference between liking and wanting.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:43.000]   Liking sugar is the function of the taste system.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.740]   And it's not really liking sugar, it's liking sweet.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:01:01.880]   Liking sugar, our never-ending appetite for sugar, is the story of the gut-brain axis.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.720]   Liking versus wanting.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.020]   And this work is work of my own laboratory that began long ago when we discovered the
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:20.040]   sweet receptors, and you can now engineer mice that lack these receptors.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.920]   So in essence, these animals will be unable to taste sweet.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.680]   A life without sweetness, how horrible.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.520]   And if you give a normal mouse a bottle containing sweet, and we're going to put either sugar
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.360]   or an artificial sweetener, alright, they both are sweet.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.800]   They have slightly different tastes, but that's simply because artificial sweeteners have
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.080]   some off-tastes.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.640]   But as far as the sweet receptor is concerned, they both activate the same receptor, trigger
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.440]   the same signal, and if you give an animal an option of a bottle containing sugar or
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.600]   a sweetener versus water, this animal will drink 10 to 1 from the bottle containing sweet.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.760]   That's the taste system.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.520]   Animal goes, samples each one, licks a couple of licks, and then says, "Uh-uh, that's the
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.280]   one I want because it's appetitive and because I love it."
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000]   So it prefers sugar to artificial sweetener.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   No, no, no.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   No, no.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Equally artificial sweetener.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.280]   In this experiment, I'm going to put only sweet in one bottle, and it could be either
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.040]   sugar or artificial sweetener, it doesn't matter which one.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.880]   Okay, we're going to do the next experiment where we separate those two.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.800]   For now, it's sweet versus water.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.840]   And sweet means sweet, not sugar.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.280]   Sweet means anything that tastes sweet, alright?
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.760]   And sugar is one example, and Splenda is another example.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   Aspartame, monk fruit, stevia, doesn't matter.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yeah, I mean, there's some that only humans can taste, mice cannot taste, because their
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.080]   receptors between humans and mice are different.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.440]   But we have put the human receptor into mice.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:19.420]   We engineer mice, and we completely humanize this mouse's taste world, alright?
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.840]   But for the purpose of this conversation, we're only comparing sweet versus water.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.040]   An option, my goodness, they will leak to know, from the sweet side, 10 to 1 at least
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.200]   versus the water.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   Make sense?
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   Alright.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.680]   Now, we're going to take the mice, and we're going to genetically engineer it to remove
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.220]   the sweet receptors.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.260]   So these mice no longer have in their oral cavity any sensors that can detect sweetness,
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.980]   be it a sugar molecule, be it an artificial sweetener, be it anything else that tastes
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.980]   sweet.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.300]   And if you give these mice an option between sweet versus water, sugar versus water, artificial
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.900]   sweetener versus water, it will drink equally well from both because it cannot tell them
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.540]   apart, because it doesn't have the receptors for sweet, so that sweet bottle tastes just
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.220]   like water.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.220]   Make sense?
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.220]   Makes sense.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.220]   Very good.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.700]   Now, we're going to do the experiment with sugar.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.620]   From now on, let's focus on sugar.
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.860]   So I'm going to give a mouse now sugar versus water.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.540]   Normal mouse will drink from the sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, very little from the water.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.700]   Knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them, mouse can no longer tell them apart, and it
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.740]   will drink from both.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.780]   But if I keep the mouse in that cage for the next 48 hours, something extraordinary happens
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.220]   when I come 48 hours later and I see what the mouse is licking or drinking from.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.740]   That mouse is drinking almost exclusively from the sugar bottle.
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.500]   How could this be?
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.980]   He cannot taste it.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.220]   He doesn't have sweet receptors.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:17.700]   During those 48 hours, the mouse learned that there is something in that bottle that makes
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.900]   me feel good, and that is the bottle I want to consume.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.700]   Now, how does the mouse identify that bottle?
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.620]   It does so by using other sensory features, the smell of the bottle, the texture of the
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.180]   solution inside.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.940]   Sugar at high concentrations is kind of goopy.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.460]   The sideness in which the bottle is in the cage, it doesn't matter what, but the mouse
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.300]   realized there is something there that makes me feel good, and that's what I want.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:04.940]   And that is the fundamental basis of our unquenchable desire and our craving for sugar, and is
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.780]   mediated by the gut-brain axis.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:16.340]   The first clue is that it takes a long time to develop, immediately suggesting a post-ingestive
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.060]   effect.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:28.420]   So we reason if this is true, and it's the gut-brain axis that's driving sugar preference,
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.220]   then there should be a group of neurons in the brain that are responding to post-ingestive
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.220]   sugar.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.780]   And lo and behold, we identify a group of neurons in the brain that does this, and these
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.740]   neurons receive their input directly from the gut-brain axis.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.260]   From other neurons.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.280]   You got it.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:07:00.380]   And so what's happening is that sugar is recognized normally by the tongue, activates an appetitive
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:08.820]   response, now you ingest it, and now it activates a selective group of cells in your intestines
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:18.860]   that now send a signal to the brain via the vagal ganglia that says, "I got what I need."
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.640]   The tongue doesn't know that you got what you need.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.840]   It only knows that you tasted it.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.140]   This knows that you got to the point that it's going to be used, which is the gut.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.420]   And now it sends the signal to now reinforce the consumption of this thing, because this
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.820]   is the one that I needed, sugar, source of energy.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.460]   Are these neurons in the gut?
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.980]   So these are not neurons in the gut.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.660]   So these are gut cells that recognize the sugar molecule, send a signal, and that signal
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.540]   is received by the vagal neuron directly.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.540]   Got it.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:03.100]   And this sends a signal through the gut-brain axis to the cell bodies of these neurons in
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:12.060]   the vagal ganglia, and from there to the brainstem to now trigger the preference for sugar.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.060]   Two questions.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.300]   One, you mentioned that these cells that detect sugar within the gut are actually within the
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   intestine.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.540]   You didn't say stomach, which surprised me.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.180]   I always think gut as stomach, but of course, intestine.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.180]   No, no.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.100]   They're intestine, because that's where all the absorption happens.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.060]   So you want the signal, you see, you want the brain to know that you had successful
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:40.060]   ingestion and breakdown of whatever you consume into the building blocks of life.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.540]   And you know, glucose, amino acids, fat.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.480]   And so you want to make sure that once they are in the form that the intestines can now
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.460]   absorb them is where you get the signal back saying, this is what I want.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.460]   Okay.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.500]   Now, let me just take it one step further.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:07.620]   And this now, sugar molecules activates this unique gut-brain circuit that now drives the
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.980]   development of our preference for sugar.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:20.800]   Now a key element of this circuit is that the sensors in the gut that recognize the
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.960]   sugar do not recognize artificial sweeteners at all.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.440]   Because their nutrient value is uncoupled from the taste.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.020]   Generically speaking, one can make that, but it's because it's a very different type of
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.020]   receptor.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.020]   I see.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.480]   It's not the tongue receptors being used in the gut.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's a completely different molecule that only recognizes the glucose molecule, not
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.980]   artificial sweeteners.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:59.480]   This has a profound impact on the effect of ultimately artificial sweeteners in curbing
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:07.200]   our appetite, our craving, our insatiable desire for sugar.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:15.520]   Since they don't activate the gut-brain axis, they'll never satisfy the craving for sugar.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.040]   Like sugar does.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:27.440]   And the reason I believe that artificial sweeteners have failed in the market to curb our appetite,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:37.500]   or need our desire for sugar, is because they beautifully work on the tongue, the liking,
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:47.920]   to recognize sweet versus non-sweet, but they fail to activate the key sensors in the gut
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:56.280]   that now inform the brain, you got sugar, no need to crave anymore.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:04.480]   So the issue of wanting, can we relate that to a particular set of neurochemicals upstream
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   of...
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.920]   So the pathway is, so glucose is activating the cells in the gut through the vagus that's
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.680]   communicated through, presumably, the no-dose ganglion and up into the brain stem.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   Very good.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   And from there, where does it go?
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   Where is it going?
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   What is the substrate of wanting?
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.680]   I, you know, of course, I think molecules like dopamine, craving, there's a book even
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.200]   called "The Molecule of More," et cetera, et cetera.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.860]   Dopamine is a very diabolical molecule, as you know, because it evokes both a sense of
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.440]   pleasure-ish, but also a sense of desiring more, of craving.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:44.200]   So if I understand you correctly, artificial sweeteners are, and I agree, are failing as
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:51.240]   a means to satisfy sugar craving at the level of nutrient sensing.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:12:00.560]   And yet, if we trigger this true sugar evoked wanting pathway too much, and we've all experienced
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.360]   this, then we eat sugar and we find ourselves wanting more and more sugar.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.160]   Now that could also be insulin dysregulation, but can we uncouple those?
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:23.400]   If we have a mega problem with over-consumption of sugar and fat, you know, we're facing a
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:33.280]   unique time in our evolution where diseases of malnutrition are due to over-nutrition.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.960]   I mean, how nuts is that, eh?
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:45.440]   I mean, historically, diseases of malnutrition have always been linked to under-nutrition.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:55.040]   And so we need to come up with strategies that can meaningfully change the activation
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:07.200]   of these circuits that control our wanting, certainly in the populations at risk.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:16.000]   And this gut-brain circuit that ultimately, you know, it's the lines of communication
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:23.200]   that are informing the brain, the presence of intestinal sugar in this example, it's
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.320]   a very important target in the way we think about, is there a way that we can meaningfully
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.500]   modulate these circuits?
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:39.720]   So I make your brain think that you got satisfied with sugar, even though I'm not giving you
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.000]   sugar.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.960]   So that immediately raises the question, are the receptors for glucose in these gut cells
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.360]   susceptible to other things that are healthier for us?
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.760]   That's very good.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.720]   Excellent idea.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:03.560]   And I think an important goal will be to come up with a strategy and identify those very
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:12.440]   means that allow us to modulate the circuits in a way that certainly for all of those where
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:21.000]   this is a big issue, it can really have a dramatic impact in improving human health.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
