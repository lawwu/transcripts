[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   I think in my opinion I think in my opinion I think in my opinion I think in my opinion I think
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:13.440]   where you save it you there are many good options and there's nothing wrong with any of the modern options for example if you just save money in a savings account and you just set money aside I think that's a really powerful thing and a lot of people would say well that's ridiculous you're not earning interest.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.980]   I think that as you start to accumulate money you start to change how you look at the world and you start to look for things to invest that money in.

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:08:02.240]  berger: I think that's probably more productive than putting money in your 401 . But I guess I would just say pick whatever, pick a system that you like, and follow it, because any, any system will work if you do. That's my first answer. That, that, along the tenor of your question, Daniel.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.420]   Yeah, that does, and I guess I, I do already have, we have about six months worth of savings.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:08.920]   Great.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:24.280]   Right.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:33.880]   So that is already in place. So you would basically say that, I mean, it would be, yes, of course I want to be saving, but obviously I know, I mean, disability insurance you're very big on. So that would, that's not a one or the other. It's kind of a both and.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.380]   Right, right.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.980]   So yeah, disability insurance is not a savings. That's just a cost. It's just like taxes. You know, you're not saving because you're paying taxes. It's just a cost. Just like groceries. The richest man in Babylon is a big picture approach.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:36.820]   So I think that's a good question.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:09:05.980]  , but what is it?
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.140]   Is it the fact that you're going to trade commodities on the internet or you've become super interested in crypto or you're going to buy single family houses and fix them up or you're going to buy a farm and populate that farm with cows or you're going to buy a farm and populate that farm with cows or you're going to buy a farm and populate that farm.

So you'll have a teacher who is working in an inner city school and every child in their classes is from just awful background and they're completely poor. That teacher can use the resources that you develop for parents and you can make your profit from the parents and build a large business selling the curriculum to parents and if you want to offer scholarships to teachers here and there, that's fine. And they'll do that with their students.

[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:44.460]   didnt know what they were doing. So I've been doing a lot of work on this. I've been working on the idea of a five year old daughter. Very awesome stuff. Financially, so where we are, I fully fund our for my 401k year over year, so the full amount and then similarly, over the last several years have opened up and fully funded Roth IRA accounts, both for myself and for my wife. I also have contributions set up for a 529 plan for my older child need to get on the stick and settle in.

[00:28:44.500 --> 00:29:13.220]  .
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.220]   I feel like for my one year old at this point. But after that, of course we would pay our mortgage. That's our only debt that we have on our house. And then basically after all the typical monthly expenses, all the extra cash and available dollars has really just been going into an online savings account. And this is since before my son was even born. And so, it's earning a measly half of a percent, I think, at this point.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:41.980]   So where I am now, I've got roughly $150,000 that I'm ready to play with or to do something with to get it out of there and to actually try and do something smarter with it.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:41.980]   And I'm really having a hard time kind of getting beyond thinking of anything other than just going to Vanguard, opening a low cost index fund fund account and just putting it in there for the total stock market index or something like that.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:41.980]   So I'm really having a hard time kind of getting beyond thinking of anything other than just going to Vanguard, opening a low cost index fund fund account and just putting it in there for the total stock market index or something like that.

[00:29:42.020 --> 00:30:10.740]  , and I know it's not about timing the market, but more about time in the market, but I still feel like a little hesitant to put all that money in in one shot right now.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:10.740]   So I was just eager to hear your perspective and thoughts as to whether or not if you were in my shoes, if you would think to do something similar and just kind of get it out of there.

[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.640]   ado, I've got a question for you.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   You are in the top few percent of U.S. Americans. You can safely afford to ignore your salary and focus on your service and your contribution to others, and then that salary increase will follow in time. On the consumption level, I think you can look at your consumption, and you can set a number or set a lifestyle that's appropriate to you. You and your wife can sit down and you can decide what lifestyle is appropriate for us. And there's no reason to expand it beyond that.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:37.820]   and be effective in a $2500 car, it would be a stupid waste of money for you to take $25,000 and go and buy another car when you could invest that $25,000 much more effectively into something else. Whether that something else is an area of need that you see in the community, a financial opportunity that you see, it'd be stupid to spend $25,000 on a car if that's not something that you personally need.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:37.820]   I think that's a good question.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   I think that's a good question.

[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:18.220]   And where I don't really have money to be able to do things with the family and stuff like that. So, I, I would really need that money in the equity to help kind of offset.

[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:49.920]   You know, I would consider, I would consider rentals apart from that too. I mean, if it's the right deal and I've listened to you enough to know when people call about like, you know, trying to pay extra towards the mortgage and things I've heard you tell them listen, save that money try to invest it and then and then once you feel like you have enough you can pay it off then pay off your mortgage but don't just make those payments to make those payments you know to cut your mortgage down and things like that because it's hard once you've done that you know it's hard to get that money out of your hands.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:06:19.940]   That's what I would consider.

[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:13.860]   I feel like I'm supposed to buy a house. I was taught to buy a house.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:29.760]   Um, every, you know, everyone in my family owns, you know, their home. My grandmother, God bless her. She's 90 years old. She owns her home. My mother owns her home. And, you know, and, and,
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:59.780]  , and it's very, I see them being very secure and I'm glad that they do have a home because obviously they're retired now.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:29.800]   I mean, I'd have the, the mortgage interest and stuff like that, but I can get right off or, you know, investment wise as far as having a home, but I can offset that by having my own business and just stay as a renter.

[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:59.900]   I had a situation with the house that I bought.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:36:59.900]   I had chickens in my backyard and some anonymous person complained to the government that I had chickens in my backyard, even though I had a half acre lot and the government comes by and they cited me for having chickens in my backyard.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:36:59.900]   They cited me for having heads that was too high.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:36:59.900]   They cited me for having a shed which was 40 years old, but it was unpermitted.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:36:59.900]   And if I didn't reckon if I didn't reckon improve these things,

[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:29.920]  ,
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:29.920]   I would start charging me a thousand dollars up to a thousand dollar a day penalty that would be held as a lien on my property.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:29.920]   Well, that's kind of a hard thing to stomach, you know, and so I had to get rid of my chickens and I had to cut my hedge and then I had to tear down what was probably a fifteen thousand dollar shed simply because somebody who built it back in the eighties didn't apply for the appropriate government permitting process.

[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   Okay.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   With 10 years at 500 bucks a year,
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   My guess would be that your policy, and do you know whether it was $25,000 or $50,000 that was issued at?
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   I think it's 50.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   Okay.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   Okay.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   So your parents bought this policy was $50,
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   and you know what your parents bought this $50,
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   I think that's an old.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   I think that's 50,
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   I think it's 50.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:30.800]   I think it's 50.
[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:48.880]   Okay.
[01:59:48.880 --> 02:00:00.820]  , you're going to pay the premiums is paying the policy, keeping the policy in force of the death benefit but you're probably at the point where just about all the money that you're putting in and premiums is going directly into the cash values. Depending on how the policy was structured, I can't answer all this stuff for sure but it would probably be a good thing.
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:00.820]   I think the policy was structured. I can't answer all this stuff for sure but it would probably be a good thing.
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:00.820]   I think the policy was structured. I can't answer all these things. I can't answer all these stuff for sure but it would probably be a good thing.
[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   It would probably be at this point where when you send in $500,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   It would probably be at this point where when you send in $500,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   It would probably be at this point where when you send in $500,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   Your cash value is probably increased by 500 and something dollars,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   Which means that your analysis here is partly on the basis of life insurance and it's partly on the basis of the cash values.
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   In short, if you order the in force illustration, you'll call a life insurance agent and you'll review it with that life insurance agent, have them explain to you the policy, explain how it works, etc. Probably where you'll wind up is you'll just say it's a good policy,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   It would probably be at this point where you send in $500,
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:01:00.860]   I think the policy would probably be at this point where you send in $500,

[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:00.940]   The money will only ever go up, so you have an account that has money in it that will only ever go up that's helpful because it means that you can count on the stability of that cash account. Now the rate at which you'll go up will vary, obviously, depending on what the dividend rate is depending on the investment portfolio etc. But it's guaranteed to go up and it's very stable.
