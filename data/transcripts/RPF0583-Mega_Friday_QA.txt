[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:49.840]   Today we do live Q&A.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.640]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.200]   Today on the show we have a live Q&A. Today was a free Q&A. I don't know, maybe some of
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.480]   these people are patrons, but I put out a note on the show and I said, "Free and open
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.040]   Q&A today. I have internet, so this'll be fun." I think we got quite the diversity of
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.900]   questions lined up.
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.880]   Every Friday that I have internet access in my current travel schedule, I try to set up
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.640]   and do a live Q&A show. Unfortunately, that has been more spotty than I wanted it to be.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.080]   Today I am doing a live Q&A show with callers, anybody caller who's just a listener of the
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.120]   show. I'm excited about that and to make use of my resources when I have them.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.600]   We go first to Daniel in Houston, Texas. Daniel, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.100]   I recently read through or listened through Richest Man in Babylon and had some questions
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.520]   about how you balance the principle of saving at least 10%, which you could argue you should
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.000]   save more than that to compensate for taxes, etc. these days, but putting that towards
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.260]   insurance as well.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.620]   Is your question that you would like to save more than 10% or is your question how should
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.060]   you allocate the money that you save among different types of ways that you could save
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.060]   money?
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.580]   I guess maybe what different types. I currently put about 5% in my 401(k). That's what my
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.480]   company matches. Then I'm also putting about another 5% in savings. I thought about putting
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.940]   more than that, but I also want to get disability insurance and some extra life insurance on
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.260]   top of that outside of what my company provides. Obviously, if I'm doing that, I'm not putting
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.420]   as much money in the savings. I guess I was curious what your thoughts were and how you
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.340]   kind of balance those two.
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.340]   That makes sense.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.980]   It's interesting and it's hard because if you're only saving 10% of your income, in
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.140]   a lot of ways you kind of wonder, is that enough? What do I actually do about this?
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.620]   So in The Richest Man in Babylon, which is my favorite personal finance book, someday
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.100]   soon I'm going to release, I'll save that for another day, but it's my favorite personal
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.180]   finance book. And the recommendation is to save 10% and to always save 10%. For most
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.380]   people who aren't saving anything, then that advice is going to totally change their world.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.260]   But if you're already saving or you're accustomed to saving, I can't see any good reason not
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.780]   to save more than 10%. And I think there are good reasons to seriously consider saving
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.780]   more than 10%. So I'm not stuck to the number. If you're only saving 10%, I think in many
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.780]   ways it really doesn't matter where you save it. There are many good options and there's
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.300]   nothing wrong with any of the modern options. For example, if you just save money in a savings
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.020]   account and you just set money aside, I think that's a really powerful thing. And a lot
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.060]   of people would say, well, that's ridiculous. You're not earning interest. I think that
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.500]   as you start to accumulate money, you start to change how you look at the world and you
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.300]   start to look for things to invest that money in. I've known a lot of very wealthy people
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.980]   who never purchased stocks. They never used IRAs. They just simply saved money in a savings
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.140]   account and they bought things from time to time that they thought were good investments.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.420]   And I've seen those things work out all over the place. So there's something to be said
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.340]   for just putting money in a savings account, or there's something to be said for just stacking
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.260]   up hundred dollar bills in a safe. Those things are valuable, but it all will depend on the
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.860]   context of the actual person and what opportunities for investing they have in front of them.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.760]   I've also seen a lot of benefit. I think there are benefits in kind of percentages that go
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.500]   beyond that. So I think there's a lot of benefit in thinking about money in terms of your safe
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.660]   money, your aggressive money, and your home run money. That's a concept I used to use
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.780]   with clients when I was talking with them about their investments. I look at things
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.620]   like your own business as an opportunity for your home run dollars. That's where you're
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.580]   really going to make it wealthy. Most people who become very wealthy become wealthy because
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.860]   of their own business. And so it has the highest potential in terms of return on investment.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.260]   Your aggressive money, I think of that like investing in other people's businesses by
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.020]   buying stocks. Safer dollars, I think of that of things like very safe assets, bonds, cash,
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.860]   value life insurance. Those are those stable, very boring things that will grow predictably.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.180]   But how to identify the difference between those and what percentages to do, I have no
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.900]   idea. There are a bunch of different models. Here's what I would say to you specifically.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.660]   Disability insurance is not savings. That's protection. And you should just buy that because
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.940]   you need it. And that shouldn't count into your savings. If you are then looking and
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.660]   saying, "Now I'm going to save 10% of my income," just strive for 10% of your gross income.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.500]   So it's an actual number. My answer of what to do with that is twofold. First, if you
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:31.060]   don't already have at least about $10,000 saved in actual accessible money, meaning
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:36.860]   stacks of currency, meaning savings accounts that you can get your hands on right away,
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.660]   then start with that because that opens up life options for you. Then if you have extra
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.700]   bonus money, like employer matches in a 401k or something like that, take advantage of
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.580]   that. And then if you're trying to figure out what to do with the balance of it, I see
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:59.100]   nothing wrong with a Roth IRA to fund a Roth IRA. And then start to work out your best
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.300]   guess on what your long-term career plans would be. Start to work on what your best
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:11.060]   guess on the assets that would most suit you. And don't be cowed by the financial planning
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.280]   industry that says, "Well, that means you have to buy stocks." Look at your own proclivities
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.180]   and interests and be willing to invest in them.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.860]   I'll give you an example. One of the things that I've always tried to do is to invest
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.740]   about 5% of my income back into myself. Now how this works into the richest man in Babylon,
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.820]   I don't know, but it doesn't. But I think it's a really good move to always invest 5%
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.720]   of your income back into your own skills, back into your own knowledge. And so when
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.700]   I was younger and broker, that meant buying lots of books. Now it means buying courses,
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.340]   buying things that have more opportunity, going to seminars, things like that. I think
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.740]   that's probably more productive than putting money in your 401(k). But I guess I would
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:59.080]   just say pick a system that you like and follow it because any system will work if you do.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.580]   That's my first answer. Does that along the tenor of your question, Daniel?
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.960]   Yeah, that does. And I guess I probably may have been helpful. I do already have, we have
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.520]   about six months worth of savings. So that is already in place. So you would basically
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.600]   say that, I mean, it would be, yes, of course I want to be saving, but obviously I know,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.560]   I mean, disability insurance, you're very big on. So that's not a one or the other,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.120]   it's kind of a both and.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.360]   Right. So yeah, disability insurance is not a savings. That's just a cost. It's just like
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.860]   taxes. You're not saving because you're paying taxes, it's just a cost, just like groceries.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.800]   The Richest Man in Babylon is a big picture approach to try to get people to do some basic
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:48.580]   things. What I would say is make your own wealth plan. What is your wealth plan? And
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.800]   if you don't know it yet, that's fine. But what is it? Is it the fact that you're going
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.920]   to trade commodities on the internet or you've become super interested in crypto or you're
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.440]   going to buy single family houses and fix them up or you're going to buy a farm and
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:11.320]   populate that farm with cows or you're going to become a CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.280]   You know, try to work out your own path based upon what intrigues you, what you're interested
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:22.400]   in and then invest the money into that, whatever that is. And the paths will vary. I would
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:30.280]   much rather myself, I would much rather buy a farm than be a Fortune 500 CEO. So I'm more
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.520]   interested in figuring out how do I buy a farm truck? How do I buy cows? How do I buy
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.640]   infrastructure? And how do I set up the kind of lifestyle that I would want to live? But
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.400]   if I were a Fortune 500 CEO and that were my goal, I would buy myself an MBA. I would
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.900]   focus on enhancing my skills and my network. And then I would just put money in stocks
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.360]   because I'm not going to have the time to deal with, I would just buy mutual funds.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.680]   I'm not going to have the time to deal with how to invest my money and what to do personally
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   on it while I'm building a company. And I would just focus on my particular career.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.040]   So it all is going to depend on your own personal wealth plan. Next we go to Fia in Vancouver,
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.240]   British Columbia. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:15.680]   Hi Josh, thanks so much for taking my call. I'll just give you a bit of backstory to my
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.440]   question. So my husband Mike and I retired just over a year ago after pursuing financial
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.480]   freedom for quite some time. And in the early stages of our retirement, we decided to start
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:36.200]   a bit of a passion project being a blog, focusing on sharing our journey to financial freedom,
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.080]   how to find contentment in financial freedom and also strategies for helping raise your
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.000]   kids financial literacy.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Are you willing to share the name of your blog?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.600]   I'm working on that only if it's okay with you.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.320]   Go ahead. Yeah, please.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   The blog is freedom101.ca.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   Great. Okay, keep going. So freedom101.ca.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:02.720]   Yeah. So I've spent about a year focusing on just trying to develop good content, what
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.640]   I hope is good content for readers to use as a resource. And it occurred to me in the
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.280]   recent past that Mike and I really want to shift our goals to more of a giving back phase
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:23.080]   of life. So we would like to try and fund some financial literacy programs for youth,
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.360]   both locally and a bit more globally. And my thought is that the blog might serve as
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:34.840]   a good platform to both as a resource for people, but also as a way to hopefully monetize
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   and fund the programs we're looking to contribute to. And my focus right now has all been really
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.960]   content based. And I'm wondering if you have tips or recommendations on how to transition
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.640]   to a monetizing focus as opposed to content.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:56.040]   I mean, just make sure I understand the question. A monetizing focus for the blog or a monetizing
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.480]   focus for how to develop a curriculum or program that would help children?
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:09.000]   Both, actually. I'm wondering if I can utilize the blog to create a stream of revenue that
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   could then be turned over either in the form of using the blog as a non-profit, but could
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.720]   then be turned over to building programs and resources to be utilized in schools for the
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.520]   financial literacy components.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:31.680]   Okay. Interesting question. So I'll give you my ideas. These are just some of my personal
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.920]   ideas. All of these ideas will be tinged with my own thoughts and approach. Feel free to
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.160]   disagree with them, but this is the best I've got. So I'm going to sidestep any question
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:50.040]   about monetizing a blog simply because that is very well covered in the online space and
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.800]   I don't have anything unique to add to that.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.320]   But I have thought a lot about how to teach kids about money. And I so I've thought a
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.380]   lot about how to teach kids about money. And I'll give you some of my ideas that maybe
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.320]   someday I'll be able to pursue or maybe not.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:15.560]   So first, I think that we need to teach children about money and we need to teach them about
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.160]   financial independence. But that's not that I don't see any way that that happens in the
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:29.300]   context of the FIRE community, for example. The concepts of FIRE might be very helpful
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.680]   to somebody who is older, somebody who's a high school senior, that type of thing. And
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.360]   I think that it would be very helpful to teach, for example, high school seniors and say,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.680]   "Listen, if you'll save 50% of your income, you can be financially independent in under
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.440]   two decades," you know, and share those lessons. I wish that I had known that at 18 years old.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.480]   I didn't. So and I know a lot of people who wish that. So if you're targeting high schoolers,
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.600]   then I think that's where the world of FIRE type of stuff could come in.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:05.480]   I would say that if your goal is to actually teach, you should completely avoid any involvement
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:11.120]   with the school system and you should avoid any involvement with the curriculum of kind
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.960]   of mainstream schools, mainstream school systems. First, if you are going to be active and involved
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.720]   in the schools, that means that you will have to be involved with the official system of
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:28.360]   curriculum development. And that system stinks. They will take anything fun and interesting
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:34.080]   that you have and they'll destroy it because it has to make mass appeal. Now, along the
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.960]   way, you could find some teachers who are individually, catch the vision and who would
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.800]   individually go with it. But if you try to move and do anything with the Leviathan of
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.720]   the official school program, whether it's in Canada or the United States, there's no
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.160]   possibility to impact those things. And I don't see any reason why you should. I, for
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.400]   example, I would not pursue trying to teach, trying to create a curriculum that teachers
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.160]   could teach because teachers are with only a few exceptions. They're not well equipped
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.200]   to teach about money. Most teachers, for example, they're not entrepreneurs. They're generally
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.520]   people who have pursued the path of teaching because they enjoy teaching, because they
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.040]   love children and they want to impact children's lives. And they want the benefits of a stable
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.800]   career within the government system. And so that is not an entrepreneurial attitude. So
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   you can't take, for example, entrepreneurship and expect a teacher to a teacher to do it.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.560]   Now, the best thing to study, make sure you study what junior achievement has done in
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.480]   the United States. And I assume probably other countries as well, although I've only was
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.320]   only involved with them in the United States. What they did was they recruited entrepreneurs,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.280]   business people to come into the classroom and they worked with teachers. And I used to
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.240]   teach junior achievement and some teachers, they loved it. Some teachers hated it. So
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.320]   you'll always find different solutions. But I think that if you start by saying, I'm going
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:02.760]   to go and change or try to work within the Leviathan of government education, I can't
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.640]   imagine that's just going to be beating your head against the wall. I see no reason to
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.520]   do that. What I think you could do is do an end run completely around that system. So
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.640]   first, if you're trying to reach high schoolers, then package your content in a way that is
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:21.240]   easily digested by high schoolers through the Internet. There's no there's not a high
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.600]   schooler in the world that you can't reach through video on YouTube. There's not a high
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.480]   schooler in the world that you can't reach through an online platform there. And there's
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.760]   no reason to worry about the people who aren't looking for the information. Your job is to
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.200]   be in a place where you're serving the people who are looking for the information. So just
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:47.920]   adjust the concepts and meet the high schoolers and you can do that on online. Now, for younger
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.120]   children, I think the biggest thing to do for younger children is we've got to figure
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:17:00.440]   out how to help them to be involved in entrepreneurial activities where they can actually make money.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.160]   One of the worst things and I'm not familiar with the laws in British Columbia, but one
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.960]   of the worst things that has happened in the United States of America is we have excluded
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.520]   children from the workforce. And so children basically don't have the opportunity to work.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.240]   And from time to time, we give them a little token, you know, idea of go start a lemonade
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.880]   stand. But it's a even even that it's gotten better now. But even that all of a sudden,
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.040]   the government, you know, comes in and says, well, no, you can't have a lemonade stand
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.320]   because you don't have the official licenses. So there's almost no opportunity for children,
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:41.720]   most children to actually be able to to earn income and to practice and to work. And so
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:48.640]   they're there. But in the in the system, they're basically taught that the only way to be successful
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.440]   in life is to go to college and get a good job. And there are a few people who buck that
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.960]   system and who figure it out themselves. But they're usually very strong personalities.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.680]   They're usually very independent thinkers. And and they're the ones I don't I think you
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   don't really have to worry about all that much about. But but they're they're very few
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.520]   in number. So what I've considered is I've thought, how do we inspire ideas? How do we
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:21.760]   inspire people to how do we inspire people to develop projects where they can do at a
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.160]   very young age? My favorite quote on this is I've always loved Jim Rohn's quote. He
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.640]   used to talk about this and he always would say that children need to have two bicycles,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.520]   one to ride and one to rent. And that's kind of what I've tried to teach my own children.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.040]   You need to have one bicycle to ride and one to rent. And I am constantly keeping my eyes
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:46.840]   open to try to figure out what are some things that that that children can do where they
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.080]   can earn money while sidestepping all of the legal regulations that keep them out of the
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.920]   workforce. And I've got a bunch of ideas. But what I think would be most effective,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.080]   effective is if you develop an independent curriculum for parents who want to teach their
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.880]   children and then profile stories and ideas of people who are doing things and show hands
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:14.600]   on the types of things that people are doing that can work out really well, then and put
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.200]   that together into an informational package and then market it in people who are not involved
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.680]   in the government schools. Now, my personal interest is I enjoy working and being around
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.440]   the community of people who are engaged in home education. And usually by the time if
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.940]   you work in that world of people who are involved in home education, much of your work is done
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:41.140]   for you where you're already finding parents who are very dedicated with their children.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:46.880]   You're finding children who are usually much better students or much more focused. And
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.960]   you're finding you're finding people who have already broken out of kind of the mainstream
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.300]   mode. So much of your work is done there. But what I haven't seen is I have not seen
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:04.680]   in that community, I have not seen any effective personal finance entrepreneurial curriculum.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.880]   I would dearly love to develop it myself. Maybe I'll get to it soon. I don't know. But
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.400]   what I would do if I were you is I would develop a curriculum and I would develop a website
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.160]   around the subject of teaching children entrepreneurship. And I would make a practice of going out and
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:26.840]   profiling and interviewing case studies, people who are doing it and trying to show people
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.520]   the things that can be done and the way that you can actually multiply money through entrepreneurship.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.720]   And then I would use that. And on the second phase of it would be personal finance. There
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:43.120]   is a huge hunger in the market for that type of content because parents struggle with ideas
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.440]   and so I would profile things like independent work that can be done online, independent
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.440]   businesses that children can do. I would focus on low cost, high value startups that people
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.440]   can do. You know, I bought this last just last week we're at a farmer's market and I
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.880]   went and I bought and I was talking to some of the there was a bunch of homeschoolers
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.640]   that had their children had tables out. And one of the young men, he was I think 14 years
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   old, he had a table where he was selling microgreens and this was his parents work to try to help
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:22.240]   him develop a business. And they had worked with him to try to help him establish a business
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.000]   growing microgreens and selling them. And I was so impressed with him and I was impressed
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.200]   with what he was learning. He was doing good salesmanship, the whole thing. But businesses
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.760]   like that are perfectly suited to to children and young people. So that's what I would do
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.920]   to bring all those things together in a concise statement. If I were trying to impact this
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.440]   part of the market, I would establish a website that was specifically focused on teaching
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.000]   children entrepreneurship. I would go and I would interview all of the authors who are
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.600]   talking about entrepreneurship, the big famous ones, people like Gary Vee, who have had a
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.280]   very loud voice, some of the academics, and I would specifically interview them on the
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.680]   topic of how do we teach entrepreneurship to children and young adults. And then I would
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.720]   develop a curriculum and I would develop a portfolio of ideas that a parent could use,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.920]   whether their children are in the government schools and they're providing extra help,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.480]   or especially for the home education community, that a parent could use with their children
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.760]   to help their children develop a business. I would partner with some of the organizations,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.920]   the small business people, the junior achievement people like the entrepreneurship organizations
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:32.240]   that are already doing it. And I would use those out those those organizations outside
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:39.520]   of the schools to try to help expand the marketing message. And then on that basis, after you
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.040]   have kids generating income, then you can add on the personal finance component and
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.240]   the FIRE stuff. So that's kind of my outline. That's what I would do if I were trying to
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.040]   pursue that. I don't know if that's helpful or anything along the lines of what you're
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.760]   thinking, but I'll pause there. Any of that in line with what you and your husband have
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   considered?
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.160]   Yeah, it's incredibly helpful to hear you put it into a much more concise form there
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:09.760]   because we were really struggling with how to gain some movement within the school system.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.160]   There has been some movement in Canada in terms of them encompassing some financial
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.640]   literacy within our actual curriculum, but the teachers are now screaming for resources
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:24.880]   to back up that content of the curriculum. And so it hasn't really had the impact that
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.640]   I think was intended behind it. So something outside the school would probably be much
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.600]   easier to achieve, as you mentioned, rather than dealing with the bureaucracy that is
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.400]   putting that system right now.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.120]   It's very helpful.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.440]   When you take something and you try to make it appeal, when you take something and you
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:53.760]   try to make it politically balanced and you try to be moderate in your opinions and you
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.920]   try to give general information, then you wind up with what's already done, which has
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:06.400]   no attractive value. There's no attractive value. But if you are willing to take an extreme
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.360]   position, if you're willing to take an extreme perspective, and you can't fake this, you
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.760]   probably don't share the ideas that I do. You probably don't have quite the strongly
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.240]   held opinions that I do that are very abrasive to some people. But if you take a more extreme
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.520]   position, then you'll attract people to that extreme position.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.560]   I guess the best example I would give here would be somebody like Gary V. If you study
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.480]   the online entrepreneurship world, I'm not aware of anybody who's more influential right
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:41.200]   now than Gary Vaynerchuk. And yet he is an extreme abrasive figure. But because of that,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.120]   he's able to break through the noise and show people, hey, there are different ways. You
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:51.720]   can do this differently. I personally don't have any idea of how you would work within
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.000]   the school system, but I see no reason to work within the school system.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.040]   Now, the only kind of people group that I don't know that I would struggle is, how do
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:09.240]   you reach the people who are the poorest? How do you reach the poorest children? In
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.520]   my mind there, I don't think you have any chance of doing that in the official system.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.640]   I think you have a twofold approach to do that. One, if you can provide a teacher with
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:28.840]   tools, that teacher may be able to take the role of the parent in some way and apply some
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.860]   of those concepts. But here, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't just focus on parents
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.120]   and let the teachers find it. So you'll have a teacher who is working in an inner city
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:44.480]   school and every child in their class is from just awful background and they're completely
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.500]   poor. That teacher can use the resources that you develop for parents, and you can make
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:55.200]   it, make your profit from the parents and build a large business selling the curriculum
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.720]   to parents. And if you want to offer scholarships to teachers here and there, that's fine. And
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.200]   they'll do that with their students. But I think the second solution is to work with
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.440]   community organizations. And what I have seen is I think the kind of the urban farming,
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:17.160]   urban gardening movement, in my mind, there's no more impactful way, no more kind of, I'm
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:24.360]   not aware of a more effective way to reach the children that are in that world. Because
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:32.040]   you can bring in, and in the concept of farming and gardening, you can use the unskilled labor
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.000]   of a child and you can show them how they can turn that unskilled labor into profitability
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.360]   because of the communal environment. So I look at some of these organizations. My favorite
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.720]   is what the urban farming guys are doing in Kansas City. I look at what some of the, many
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.000]   of the people in the, again, the urban farming, urban gardening world are doing. And I think
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.040]   they're having the most effective inroads into the poorest communities and developing
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:04.240]   the platforms to, you know, developing the platforms to do it. And I think that if you
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.840]   started with something like that, and I don't know if that's any of your interest, it's
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.800]   an interest of mine. But if you start with that and then you develop that and add on
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:17.040]   the makerspace community, then I think you can really start to provide opportunities
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.200]   for children and young people to start to be productive and to see how the fruit of
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.120]   their labors can really make a difference. So check out what the urban farming guys are
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.960]   doing in Kansas City if you haven't seen that, and hopefully that would be inspirational
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.960]   to you as well.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   I definitely will do that.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.160]   And keep in touch. So your blog is freedom101.ca and we will look forward to hopefully seeing
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.600]   more from you on the topic. I would love to see you and your husband tackle it. I'd love
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.080]   to see dozens and dozens of people tackle it. I'd like to tackle it. If I could figure
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.000]   out how to make it work, I would dearly love to tackle it myself. But in the meantime,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.720]   we'll just have to defend on the audience. Mike in New Jersey, welcome to the show. How
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   can I serve you today?
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:04.880]   Hey, thanks, Josh. Really appreciate it. So my question is, I guess, in a nutshell, looking
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.600]   for some direction on what to do with some extra cash. So to give you the backstory,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.240]   I'm 40, married, two kids. My wife is a stay at home. I have a 10-year-old son and a one-year-old
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.440]   daughter. Very awesome stuff.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:28.680]   Financially, so where we are, I fully fund my 401(k) year over year to the full amount.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:34.200]   And then similarly, over the last several years, have opened up and fully funded Roth
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.880]   IRA accounts, both for myself and for my wife.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:45.240]   I also have contributions set up for a 529 plan for my older child. I need to get on
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.560]   the stick and set one up, I feel like, for my one-year-old at this point. But after that,
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:56.040]   of course, we pay our mortgage. That's our only debt that we have on our house.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.760]   And then basically, after all the typical monthly expenses, all the extra cash and available
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.840]   dollars has really just been going into an online savings account. And this is since
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:14.120]   before my son was even born. And so, it's earning a measly half of a percent, I think,
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.760]   at this point.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:23.200]   So where I am now, I've got roughly $150,000 that I'm ready to play with or to do something
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.160]   with to get it out of there and to actually try and do something smarter with it. And
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.640]   I'm really having a hard time kind of getting beyond thinking of anything other than just
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   going to Vanguard, opening a low-cost index fund account, and just putting it in there
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.400]   for the total stock market index or something along those lines.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.960]   And at this point, of course, we're at an all-time high, essentially, in the stock market.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:57.200]   And I know it's not about timing the market, but more about time in the market. But I still
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.440]   feel a little hesitant to put all that money in one shot right now.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.200]   So I was just eager to hear your perspective and thoughts as to whether or not, if you
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.080]   were in my shoes, if you would think to do something similar and just kind of play the
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:19.080]   index fund game at this point, or if you'd have any other ideas.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:26.600]   Why do you think you shouldn't just go ahead and plan to invest it into index funds?
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:36.160]   Yeah, I don't know. I guess because for me, it's basically all of our money that's liquid
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.080]   at this point that I would be putting in the market. Of course, we know the risks associated
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:47.400]   with that. And I know you don't lose the money until you actually sell. So if I put it all
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:53.160]   in there tomorrow and the market took a bath and lost half of its value, I didn't lose
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.520]   anything until I sell. And I really wouldn't put anything in there that I'm not comfortable
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:05.240]   with that risk. Of course, keep probably a 10-month safety account always available,
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.400]   probably in that same online savings account. But I don't know. I've been struggling this
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:16.960]   for maybe about a year and just watching my money really not do anything and not even
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   keep up with inflation.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.880]   So let me just, you went right to the question of, should I invest the money all at once,
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.680]   which I'll give you some thoughts on. But first, I want to just ask about the investment
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:39.480]   idea, regardless of how or when you put it in there. Why do you feel uncertainty about
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.580]   just simply saying, "You know what? I'm just going to go ahead and start putting this money
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.840]   into Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund."
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   Yeah, you know what? I guess I feel maybe I stated it not super clearly. I like the
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:58.680]   idea of index funds. I think it's a great idea and that's what I do for the Roth IRAs
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.560]   that we have. And I just think it's a good move. Personally, I like that. I am comfortable
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:09.160]   with that. I guess the question's more along the lines of, is that kind of tunnel vision?
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.920]   Am I thinking too narrowly? Should I look beyond that to other investment vehicles?
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.260]   And then as you touched on it, I did mention, you know, putting kind of going all in, big
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:26.400]   bang approach, just put everything in at this point versus maybe trying to take that $150K
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.840]   and do a little bit of dollar cost averaging and maybe go in spurts with it. So those are
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.320]   certain things that I've been thinking about as well.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:41.480]   Okay. So two questions. The first question is, should I put the money into an index fund
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.280]   or should I do something else with it? The second question is, if I've decided to put
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.120]   the money into the index fund, how and when should I put it in? So let me just answer
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.320]   the first one very briefly. If you don't have an alternative, if you're happy with that,
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:00.920]   then you should do it. Now, I may not do that. You know, Joe next door might not do that.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.280]   But if you are happy with that, you should do that. And there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:11.160]   You're not being stupid for doing it. It all comes down to your particular options in life,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.760]   your particular satisfaction with your career, your lifestyle, your particular interests,
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.900]   the things that you like to do. Those are very subjective. And so it sounds like you've
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:25.520]   already made that decision. So go for it. There's nothing wrong with just having a bunch
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.640]   of money in a stock market index fund because that is, I mean, a Vanguard total stock market
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:38.440]   index fund is such a massively diversified, safe basket of assets. You've got thousands
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:44.000]   of companies from all over the world that own billions of dollars of real estate, have
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.200]   all kinds of diverse interests, incredibly safe investment. If we measure safety by actual
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.280]   value. Now, there'll be volatility. But the way you answer that, you already answered
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.520]   that in terms of your phase of life. You're saving a lot of money. You have savings. So
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.480]   the volatility, who cares? So let me answer the question of how and when should I put
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.240]   it in? Should I put it in all at once and just stroke a check to Vanguard for $100,000
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.140]   tonight or should I put it in over time? The academic answer is clear. You should put it
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:16.300]   in all at once because it is impossible to know what's going to happen. And the statistical
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:22.600]   likelihood is a decade from now, however high the stock market is today, a decade from now,
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.120]   statistically, it'll be much higher. So whether or not there's a dump two or three years from
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   now, statistically, a decade from now, it'll be higher. That's the academic answer. The
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:37.480]   real answer is nobody does that because nobody can stomach the regret that they would face
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.600]   of doing that in two or three years. And so given that, I would say start slow. What I
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:48.200]   would do in your situation is I would say I'm going to invest 2000 bucks a month and
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.760]   make it set up a $2000 a month transfer from my savings account into this index fund. And
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.600]   I would do that for the next six months, next three months, next six months, and just watch
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.040]   it. And then if you continue to be happy with it, watch the market. If you continue to be
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:07.680]   happy with it, then maybe bump it up to 3000 a month. But at 2000 a month in four years,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.720]   you can put in $100,000 and you bump it up to three years and now you're at your time
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.620]   to put in $100,000 in three years. I think that's entirely reasonable to manage the significant
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.480]   risk of the stock market at a very high and your personal regret if the stock market goes
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.600]   down. And then you watch it. And then if a year from now we're deep in the throes of
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:33.400]   a recession and the Dow has dumped off 20% and the S&P 500 has dumped off 20%, then you
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.920]   might go ahead and start putting in more. But the academic answer is you should put
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.260]   it all in today. But the realistic answer is nobody's going to do that. It's too much
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.420]   of a risk. So I would say set up an auto draft for $2000 a month right now and then six months
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:53.900]   from now reassess and either increase it or just keep it steady and then watch for decline.
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.840]   And when you see decline, then go ahead and stroke a big check.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:04.960]   Very cool. What are your thoughts, if I may, around the robo investment options to take
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.200]   a little bit of a different angle on it?
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.520]   Don't see any compelling benefits, but there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.400]   Okay. But the automatic rebalancing and things like this?
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:23.180]   But what I understood was you were going to kind of pursue the Jim Collins approach of
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.380]   just owning a total stock market index fund, right?
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.880]   Yeah, that's where I'm leaning.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.180]   So in that case, rebalancing really is immaterial. You're just going to buy the stock market
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:40.500]   fund and in that context, you're buying a massively diversified, very balanced portfolio
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.460]   that's reflective of a huge range of industries. So I don't see any problem with that. If that
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.160]   is what has attracted you, I see no problem with it.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.700]   The problem, I know it sounds like a wishy-washy answer. I don't have a strong opinion on it.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:59.860]   It's like arguing, should you buy a Honda Accord or a Toyota Corolla? Ask a car guy
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:04.960]   and maybe there's some feature that an Accord has that a Corolla doesn't have, or maybe
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.560]   somebody just likes Toyota, but I don't have any strong opinion on it because I'm unconvinced
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.000]   that it's this incredible buy that you should absolutely invest with a robo-advisor, but
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.600]   there's nothing wrong with it. It works fine. So that's why I'm so ambivalent about it.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.360]   Well, it makes sense. Josh, I appreciate it.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.200]   Hey, my pleasure. Thank you for calling in. We go now to Samir in Chicago. Samir, welcome
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.120]   to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:38.520]   Hi, Josh. My question is, what would you recommend I or someone in my situation does to protect
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.920]   my future wife, relationships, things of that sort from the assets that I have currently
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:51.480]   and the assets that I'll accumulate before that marriage occurs? So assets, income, investments
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.120]   and such.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.600]   Are you concerned about the financial risk of divorce? Meaning if you were to marry and
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   then you were to divorce and your wife were to take half of your assets, is that your
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.000]   specific concern?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.320]   So the concern is kind of the exact opposite where I'm concerned that my current financial
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:18.400]   situation would affect my future relationship in a way that I don't want it to affect.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   Are you poor or are you rich?
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:28.720]   I'm neither, but I'm working towards, I think I'm pretty well off for my age and well off
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720]   financially.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:36.920]   And is there a woman in the picture right now or is this more of a future potential?
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.400]   There's no one in the picture right now. This is more of if I get married in five years,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.120]   what's going to happen at that time.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.560]   So here's some suggestions for you and hopefully this will hit on what you're asking. So first,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:59.840]   I think in general finances and marriage are not particularly related. And what I mean
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:08.080]   by that, I would encourage you to be financially prudent so that you are prepared for marriage,
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.880]   but you're already doing that. And I'm convinced, and many people will talk about things like,
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.480]   well, I've got to wait until I can afford to get married. It's all nonsense. Either
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:25.280]   you're committed to marriage and you're pursuing the path of marriage or you're not. And you
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.040]   can be rich and not pursue marriage, or you can be rich and pursue marriage, or you can
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:35.320]   be poor and pursue. I don't see any connection between finances and marriage. Marriage very
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:41.620]   much is going to come down to a philosophy and a worldview and a plan for your life in
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:46.680]   terms of what you prioritize and what values you hold to be important.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.440]   Now, it sounds like from what you're saying that you consider yourself to be the marriageable
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:57.320]   type. Marriage is important to you. You don't consider this to be a death trap. You consider
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.280]   it to be something worth planning for. I agree with you and I think that's worth considering.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.960]   So the bulk of what I would encourage you to do is to spend your time thinking about
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:13.240]   who would be the appropriate person to marry. What is the appropriate ideology that you're
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.720]   looking for in a wife? What is the type of woman that you are looking for? Because if
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:25.000]   you are in today's world, in today's marriage environment, if you are just going into marriage
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.800]   thinking that, "I believe in love and I love you," you're in for a rude surprise. Love
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:35.040]   doesn't matter. It's not something that'll make a difference. Love is something that
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:45.640]   has to be built on a strong foundation of commitment and of ideological alignment and
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:52.480]   common goals and common vision and mutual respect of you and your potential mate.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.000]   So what I would encourage you to do is spend a lot of time thinking about marriage and
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.560]   get clear on the type of woman that you are looking to marry and then get busy going and
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:08.320]   finding her because your odds of finding a great wife are now. Now, unfortunately, I
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.080]   don't know how old you are, but it's always better to go now than to wait for later because
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:18.120]   the pool of eligible candidates starts to change and especially... How old are you,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   Samir?
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   I'm 23.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:27.000]   Okay. So at 23, if you survey the potential marketplace of potential spouses, you will
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.920]   find an interesting dichotomy. If you are looking for a girl and looking for a girl
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.960]   that's interested in marriage, in your current age bracket, you will be able to find that
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.600]   kind of girl. But if you wait a few years, what will happen is all of the girls that
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.240]   say, "No, I don't need to be married. I'm not that interested in it. I'm just going
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.560]   to wait around and I'm going to have my fun." What will happen is they will continue to
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:58.240]   do that and pursue that course of action until they're in their 30s. And so the marketplace
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:03.760]   of potential mates will start to dry up in your late 20s. And those types of girls don't
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.360]   turn around and start considering marriage again until they're in their 30s. But at that
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.920]   point in time, I'm not sure you necessarily want to be married to them, at least many
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.680]   of them. So I would encourage you to look seriously now, make it a priority now, but
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:21.000]   I don't see any relation to that with your finances other than personal prudence. That's
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.200]   very much kind of an ideological discussion. That's very much a discussion of what you're
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:32.760]   looking for. And that's much more of your being willing to be serious and to seriously
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:39.180]   pursue and to find a wife. And I think it's absolutely doable. But that one decision,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.280]   all of those things will make a bigger difference in your money and in your life than almost
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:49.160]   anything else. If you marry poorly, if you marry a wife who is not prudent, if you marry
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:56.600]   a wife who is not frugal, if you marry a wife who is not committed to you, then of course,
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:01.560]   all of those types of things have incredible impacts on your finances, but you can't really
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.760]   solve them with finances. Now, financially, I would encourage you just go ahead and work
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.080]   on building your fortune and building your life. And if you'll do that and you'll be
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:17.720]   prudent, you will have done the majority of what you need to do in order to be financially
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:23.280]   successful in marriage. I don't see any reason to put off any of your decisions with the
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.160]   idea of a potential of getting married in the future. You don't know whether that's
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   going to be six months from now or six years from now. And I think that's too uncertain
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.320]   to try to make any financial decisions based upon what may or may not happen, especially
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.440]   if you're not currently interested in and pursuing a woman. So I think your best bet
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.720]   is just focus on building your fortune, work on your plans, and think carefully about the
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.400]   kind of girl that you would want to be married to so that you will recognize her when you
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:55.600]   meet her and then make a priority of meeting her. Don't approach it haphazardly. I've watched
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:01.920]   a lot of my friends and I'm in the phase, I'm in my early to going on going to my mid
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:07.320]   thirties. And what's interesting is I'm in the phase right now where most of my friends
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:12.080]   who did not prioritize marriage have now decided that, "Okay, I'm ready to look around and
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.200]   I'm ready to get married." And many of them, both male and female, are deeply frustrated
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.680]   by it. So that's my personal opinion. Take it for what it is. But I would just say build
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:28.400]   your fortune, build your business, build your career, save money, invest money effectively,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:34.040]   but don't worry about that until or unless you find a suitable candidate. Make sense?
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:39.480]   Yep. It makes a lot of sense. Appreciate it. My pleasure. Any follow-up questions or is
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.760]   that enough for now? That's good for now. I appreciate it. Well, I would say keep up
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.360]   doing the good work and be, well, keep doing what you're doing. And my encouragement to
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:56.000]   you is make it very clear that you are interested in marrying, but be very careful and very
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   discriminating in your selection process. I was talking with my wife last week and I
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.080]   was reading the article, I shouldn't even say, I was reading an article in New York
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:17.760]   Times opinion piece. And I was just reflecting on how hopelessly naive I was when I was in
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:23.440]   my early twenties. And I was far more of a curmudgeon than most people my age, but I
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:31.400]   was still hopelessly naive. And the entire world has shifted in terms of the sexual marketplace,
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:36.480]   the dating marketplace, the marriage marketplace. And I would encourage you do your research
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.580]   and be very careful because of one wrong decision can completely change your life, but one right
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.640]   decision can completely bless your life. I'll go to Ben in South Dakota. Ben, welcome to
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:50.560]   the show. How can I serve you today, sir? Hey, Josh, thanks so much. Really appreciate
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:57.000]   you taking the time to answer my call. Hey, my question runs along the line of contentment
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.680]   in comparison. To give you a little background story, I'm 29 years old, 24 years old, me
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:09.200]   and my wife are a hundred thousand dollars in debt. Since then, we went through the Dave
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:16.640]   Ramsey route, paid off all our debt and are now able to save and invest 20% of our income.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.960]   And just reflecting over the last five years, I thought I was going to be at a point where
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:28.120]   I was just going to be extremely happy with that. And though I am very excited about that,
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:33.040]   I still come from a sales background where I can always be doing more and I could be
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.000]   more efficient here and more efficient there. And so I'm struggling to figure out, you know,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.360]   the grass field is the same way to me as it did five years ago. And so I didn't know if
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:51.920]   you had any thoughts on how to be satisfied with what we're doing on a daily basis. Do
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.440]   you feel like you should be making more money? Do you feel like you should be saving more
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:01.960]   money? Can you give any more texture to that discontentedness that you feel? Yeah. So,
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:08.200]   I mean, we're making more money than I ever thought we would. So it doesn't have anything
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:14.840]   to do with that. It more has to do with just feeling like we're still some sort of like
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:22.120]   a rat in a wheel and the fact that we have $200,000 saved for retirement and I'm 29 years
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:28.560]   old and I feel like, you know, there's just, there's not a number where I'm going to be
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.160]   content with. I remember listening to one of your podcasts and you mentioned, you know,
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.620]   this guy that said, you know, there's a little bit more is all I need. And so I'm having
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:43.240]   a hard time balancing and figuring out what do I need versus what do I want, if that makes
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:51.360]   sense. Tell me about your career and about your satisfaction with your career and what
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:48:00.680]   you're doing every day for work. Yeah. So I'm a regional sales manager and I'm cold
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:06.480]   calling bringing on new vendors and at the end of the day when I bring in those new vendors,
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:15.720]   there's a healthy commission for me. So work is something that I, you know, I foresee me
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:21.480]   doing for the foreseeable future, but it's something that, you know, I would like to
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:28.760]   change when I feel like I have enough. When you have enough what? If that makes sense.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:34.520]   Well when I feel like I've hit that number of having enough money. You have at least
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:41.760]   $200,000. Is that not enough money for you to change careers? Well, I don't think so
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:49.460]   because I feel like I need to keep putting in money, keep putting in money, keep putting
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:56.040]   in money so that, you know, 10 years from now I can do something else. I don't know.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.480]   I struggle with the fact that, you know, I apologize that I'm not as clear and as concise
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:06.920]   as I wanted to be on my question, but, you know, I just really struggle with, I can always
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:12.440]   be putting in more and 10 years from now I'll have the same mindset of you can always be
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:19.480]   putting in more. Right, right. Yeah. In my opinion, and I was trying to ask you an inflammatory
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.620]   question to try to kind of trigger an emotional response in you, but I hope you'll consider
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.880]   about the question. And I would just say, dude, first of all, how much money do you
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.160]   have including retirement? Because you've got six months, if you're doing Dave Ramsey,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.600]   you've got a six month emergency fund. How much money do you have? What's your net worth?
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:45.240]   Yeah. So we have a $20,000 savings account, 200,000 in 401ks and IRAs, and I'm still driving
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.840]   a $2,500 car. Yeah. So I guess what I would say is, dude, you got enough money. You've
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:58.760]   got, you've got almost $250,000, which is incredible because you can change from anything
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:04.800]   you're doing now. You can change anything in your life. You could change jobs. You could
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.240]   change companies. You could change careers. You could change houses. You could change
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:17.000]   cities. You could change states. You have today plenty of money to make any decision
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.520]   in the world that you want. You already have enough money. You don't have enough money
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.600]   to quit working and sit back on your heels for the rest of your life, but you have enough
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:35.440]   money to change anything in your life that you want to change. And so if you can embrace
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.360]   that, hang on one second. I'm going to find my financial calculator. I left it in the
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:43.760]   drawer. Hold on. I have to go to the backup financial planner, backup calculator. What
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.640]   kind of, sorry, financial planner doesn't have their calculator on their desk when they're
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.040]   recording a live Q and A show. You said you are 29 years old right now. Is that right?
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.640]   Okay. So let's put this in here and let's just, let's just talk about how much money
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.320]   you will have for retirement. And then we'll come back to how much money you have today.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:10.960]   So you've got $200,000 for our present value. 29 to 59 would be 30. So let's go 35 years
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.380]   to age 64. Let's say you earn what? 8% on your investments and you stop putting money
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:23.480]   in there. Okay. If you quit today with $200,000 in your retirement accounts and you don't
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:29.800]   put any more money into those accounts, but they continue to grow. If they grew at 8%,
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:39.560]   it would be $2,957,000 at age 64. Now from Dave Ramsey, I should use 12% and see what
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:49.680]   this number is. Let's see here. So 12% you would have, oh no, $10,559,000. So the point
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:58.320]   is that you're already, if you quit today and you did nothing but spend every dollar
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:07.280]   that you earn today, you're already very likely to be a multimillionaire. You're already there
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:13.300]   and you have enough money that you can change anything in your life. So you have already
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:20.000]   achieved financial freedom. It's done. You don't have to change anything else. And if
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.480]   you just continue on the track that you are right now, you stay committed to not borrowing
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:32.320]   money and you maintain prudence with your finances of saving some of your income, you
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:38.000]   will be incredibly wealthy for the rest of your life. Now it doesn't feel like that today
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.960]   for a couple of reasons. Number one, all of your money, most of your money, with the exception
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.400]   of your emergency fund is locked away in your 401k. And because it's locked away in your
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:53.640]   401k, you perceive that you can't use it. Number two, you have not yet reached the point
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:53:00.920]   in the compound interest curve where your wealth is growing because of itself. You're
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.480]   still putting more money into your 401k than it is growing every year. But a decade or
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.560]   two from now, that will change. But you've already laid the foundation. So my answer
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:18.120]   to your question is to reassess your life and to do your very best to ignore money.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.040]   And you are asking the question that was one of the things that drove me out of the formal
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:27.560]   financial planning industry. Because if you had been sitting down with me in my office
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:32.320]   when I worked as a professional financial planner, I would have told you, you need $27
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:37.360]   million to retire because we would figure out how much we would run all the math. And
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:43.440]   you would have left my office feeling stressed because you've got to save more money. And
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.080]   over a period of years, I looked at it and I said, this is stupid. Why does our entire
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:51.880]   system keep people from living the life that they want to live when you've already done
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:56.480]   the things you need to do? So my answers today are very different than they once were. I
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:00.440]   want you to keep saving and investing tons of money, but I want you to build the life
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:07.160]   of your dreams now. And so what I would encourage you to do is a few things. Number one, I would
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:13.120]   encourage you to carefully assess your career. The two questions that I think are worth answering
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:18.000]   on paper carefully are these, and many others as well, but worth answering carefully on
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.720]   paper are these. Number one, what would I do if I knew I could never retire? Because
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:28.600]   you probably, I don't know, but I don't know if you would do what you're doing now if you
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   knew you could never do anything else. So start by saying, I'm never going to be able
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:38.960]   to retire, which means I've got to build a job or a business or a work life that I'm
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.760]   excited about going to every day because I'm never going to be able to retire. And I don't
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.680]   want to live in drudgery for the rest of my life. So start with that. Then on a different
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:54.880]   day, ask yourself the question, what would I do if I were already retired? What would
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:00.200]   I do if, you know, great aunt Jane died and left me $10 million tax free? What would I
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:04.240]   do? And kind of brainstorm that and try to see if there's a connection between those
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:12.200]   two things. But I personally find financial goals very unfulfilling. So here's my personal
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:18.480]   philosophy. Well, first build a business and a work life that you're really excited about
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.760]   for reasons that are important to you. Number two, live in a place that you're excited about
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.080]   for reasons that are important to you. Number three, build a family that you're excited
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:34.760]   about for reasons that are important to you. Those are areas where you can make big impact
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:40.720]   and it doesn't cost a lot of money. When it comes to earning, I think you should always
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:48.080]   change your numbers of earning into a sense of impact or a sense of contribution. I believe
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:55.560]   personally that the basic foundation of earning is service. And so making more money is a
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:02.880]   major goal because making more money equates to my serving more effectively. The people
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:08.040]   who get the richest are the ones who serve the most effectively and serve the most people.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:15.560]   Dave Ramsey is probably the richest financial pundit out there. I don't know if, my guess
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:20.940]   would be that he is, but he's also served the most people out there the most effectively.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:26.780]   And so a guy, his career, he can look at that and feel satisfied that the more effectively
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:31.480]   he serves, the more money he makes. And you and I should be doing exactly the same thing.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:37.500]   So focus on your contribution and your service. You can safely afford to ignore your salary
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:42.240]   at this point in life because you're rich. You are in the top few percent of US Americans.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.400]   You can safely afford to ignore your salary and focus on your service and your contribution
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:54.960]   to others. And then that salary increase will follow in time. On the consumption level,
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:57:00.440]   I think you can look at your consumption and you can set a number or set a lifestyle that's
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:05.360]   appropriate to you. You and your wife can sit down and you can decide what lifestyle
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:11.240]   is appropriate for us. And there's no reason to expand it beyond that. If you can do your
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:17.080]   job and be effective in a $2,500 car, it would be a stupid waste of money for you to take
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:23.800]   $25,000 and go and buy another car when you could invest that $25,000 much more effectively
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:29.400]   into something else. Whether that something else is an area of need that you see in the
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:34.440]   community, a financial opportunity that you see, it'd be stupid to spend $25,000 on a
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:38.880]   car if that's not something that you personally need.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.720]   Now on the other hand, if you say, "I want to spend $25,000 on a car because it's really
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:46.120]   important to me," fine. Some people live their life and they're so embarrassed about the
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:50.240]   car they drive that they never park in the parking lot. If that matters to you, go buy
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:57.960]   a decent car. But minimize your expenses and set your consumption at a level that is appropriate
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:04.000]   for you and your family, and then save everything beyond that and invest it into something that
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.160]   can grow.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:13.040]   What I would encourage you is start to build your satisfaction. And the key to building
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.760]   wealth is to build your personal satisfaction around your financial productivity, your skill
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:23.800]   with growing assets, your skill with investing wisely, your skill with making an impact,
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.560]   and less upon your consumption. Then from now on, you can always have your consumption
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:32.340]   and your income completely disconnected, and you can feel a sense of satisfaction there.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:36.840]   So those are my answers to it. I don't think there is a financial answer. If you don't
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:44.320]   solve these things of career impact, family impact, living where and how we want to live,
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.520]   if you don't solve and get a sense of clarity about the service that you provide in your
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.760]   work, 10 years from now, you could have $2 million in the bank and you would still feel
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:59.680]   like you didn't have enough money to change. So if you had a thousand bucks to your name,
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:06.120]   I would say save 10, but dude, you're rich, so act like it. Enough for now, Ben?
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.680]   Perfect, Josh. I really appreciate your time.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:12.320]   Thank you for calling in, sir. We go to Bart in Florida. Bart, welcome to the show. How
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.320]   can I serve you?
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:20.720]   Hey, Josh. Thank you very much. I'll get right down to it. I'm 52 years old. I retired last
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:27.800]   year, a 31-year career in public service. Started my own business, trying to do exactly
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:34.040]   what you just told your listeners to do, and that is try to serve others and make a contribution.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.560]   So I'm doing training consulting right now, which I enjoy. Trying to get that off the
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.560]   ground, but it's not something that's really paying the bills. I have a pension because
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:49.000]   I worked in public service for so long. I have a monthly pension that I have. I just
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.800]   sold in the last month, we just sold our home in South Florida where we have lived for 19
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:59.680]   years. So we had a good deal of equity in it. And we've moved 300 miles up the coast
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:06.600]   to Northeast Florida and we're renting right now a pretty inexpensive apartment.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:12.400]   I am looking to purchase a home within the next year. And because I have this sizable
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:18.160]   chunk of money from the equity in the sale of my home in South Florida, I'm wrestling
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:24.920]   with this idea about how much money to, do I just buy a home outright? Do I take the
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.640]   Dave Ramsey approach, which I've done Financial Peace University. I know his philosophy on
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:37.880]   that and, or, do I take out a mortgage and maybe go the Rick Edelman way, take out a
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:45.440]   big mortgage and do it that way. And maybe take the difference in the money from the
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:54.960]   equity that I have and invest it. And of course I'm not super risky, but at the same time,
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:01.960]   I am retired. So I would probably look to invest the sizable portion of this equity
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:10.720]   in an index fund and a total stock market index fund like you talked about earlier.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:21.000]   And yet also, maybe think about doing some CD laddering on this home. So I can get the
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:29.120]   most return on this money that I'm not putting into the house. I mean, like putting as far
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:37.280]   as a down payment on the home. And maybe do like a take out a year and put it in a long,
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.600]   or excuse me, put it in the highest interest rate savings or checking account that's out
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:49.880]   there. And then maybe do like a five year laddering of CD. So allowing for market corrections
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:55.760]   and things like that. And then the remainder of that money would be in the total stock
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.400]   market index fund. I'd just like to know your thoughts and opinions about it. Maybe if you
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.080]   were in my situation.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.080]   Do you have children?
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:12.800]   I, well, I do. I have two older sons right now who are in college. They're pretty much,
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:21.380]   they're fine. They're good. And then I have a son who just started high school.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.280]   How much is your monthly pension?
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.360]   $5,000 a month.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:33.240]   And can you live with your household budget? Can you live on under $5,000 per month?
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:39.800]   I could, but I mean, like right now I'm doing it, of course, but I would kind of like to
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.280]   maintain the same standard of living that we had when we were in South Florida. So I'm
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.840]   looking to purchase a home that's probably equivalent in value. And I don't, looking
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.880]   at the numbers, I can't, I can't, I really can't pay that, you know, that mortgage. I
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.960]   don't think I could pay. I mean, I'd be strapped. I don't want to be cash strapped, you know,
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:08.320]   you know, on my mortgage here. And where I don't really have money to be able to do things
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:17.000]   with the family and stuff like that. So I would really need that money in the equity
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.520]   to help kind of offset some of those payments on the home.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:27.040]   How much of a, what price range of a house are you considering?
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:31.520]   Probably $400,000 to $500,000.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.000]   And how much did you sell your house in South Florida for?
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.480]   I sold it for over $500,000.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:46.000]   Absent, in addition to this equity and in addition to your pension, do you have other
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.720]   significant assets or other significant investments at this point?
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.520]   I do. I do. I have, because I was in government for a period of time in Florida, I'm sure
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.440]   you're familiar with the deferred retirement option plan or the drop. I have a sizable
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:06.160]   chunk of change in there. And of course I did deferred compensation for almost the entire
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.040]   time of my career. So I have a nice chunk of change in deferred comp.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:17.480]   Well played, well played. With your, with your pension, is that guaranteed for your
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.280]   entire life at the same level?
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:25.480]   Yes. Yes. Yes. It's not going to change. I mean, I could get a COLA, you know, I'm not
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:30.120]   counting on COLA's. I mean, I'm not an FRS. I know you're familiar with that. I was a
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.160]   local municipal plan, but it was not FRS.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.200]   Do you have any interest, you mentioned putting the money in the stock market. Do you have
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.000]   any interest in owning other real estate other than the house that you live in?
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.680]   Actually I've considered that. In fact, kind of one of the things that I thought about
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:54.560]   or considered is maybe doing rental properties. And, you know, while we're right here in Northeast
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.320]   Florida right now and I'm enjoying it, I'm liking it. I don't know if I'm going to be,
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:05.000]   if this is my forever place to stay. I mean, it's possible, you know, in five to 10 years
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.800]   we might want to uproot and go somewhere else. So, you know, maybe think about possibly,
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.840]   you know, this home, this next home that we might buy might, might later, I might later
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.680]   consider that as a possible rental opportunity.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.680]   So that's-
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.080]   But yeah, I would consider, I would consider rentals apart from that too. I mean, if it's
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.880]   the right deal and I've listened to you enough to know when people call about like, you know,
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.120]   trying to pay extra towards their mortgage and things, I've heard you tell them, listen,
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.520]   save that money, try to invest it. And then, and then once you, once you feel like you
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.760]   have enough, you can pay it off, then pay off your mortgage. But don't just make those
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.920]   payments to make those payments, you know, to cut your mortgage down and things like
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.480]   that because it's hard once you, once you've done that, you know, it's hard to get that
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.120]   money out of your house. Then you got to take out a HELOC or whatever. And I really don't
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:57.480]   want to do that. I want to try to avoid, you know, you know, taking money out of my home
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:04.400]   like that if possible. I'd rather, I really, if I see a good opportunity, I mean, if having
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:11.360]   this money in a long-term equity index fund, excuse me, an index fund, you know, gives
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:17.240]   me the opportunity to, that if I do see a good investment opportunity, you know, I can
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.520]   jump on it and I can seize it.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.680]   So here would be a few suggestions for you. First, with regard to your business, your
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:31.720]   investments and your household budget, I think you should challenge yourself to live on your
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:37.680]   income and not to spend your capital. So if you had to spend your capital, obviously you
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:43.320]   could, you could take money from what you've saved here and spend it. But why do that?
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:48.640]   Go ahead and embrace the idea of living on your income and set yourself a personal challenge
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:54.160]   of generating enough income to provide for your lifestyle and especially with your consulting
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.680]   and training business. Use, keep, keep, even though you're rich and even though you're
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:04.480]   financially independent, keep your, keep the pressure on yourself to make sure that you're
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.880]   not just goofing off, to make sure that you're dedicated to what you're doing and figure
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:14.240]   out how to use that financial pressure to keep you working and productive. And so figure
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.680]   out how to live on your income. With regard to a mortgage, there's no, I don't see any
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:26.520]   reason for you to not get a mortgage on your personal residence. And the reason I say that
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:35.080]   is because you have a, you have a guaranteed income. And so there is virtually no risk.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.440]   There's virtually no reason why you would not be able to pay a mortgage payment because
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.680]   you have a guaranteed income that is not connected to your work. The biggest benefit of debt-free
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:52.400]   houses, especially for young people, is the risk reduction. The fact that if they, if
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.800]   you get sick or hurt or laid off, et cetera, that you can, that you don't have a mortgage
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.960]   and that dramatically lowers your risk. But for a retiree, especially one who has a guaranteed
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:10.800]   fixed pension, what's the benefit? Unless it's just very important to you to be debt-free,
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:16.080]   ultimately you could pay a mortgage. What I would do if I were in your shoes is I would
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:21.080]   buy a rental house. I would pay cash for it, or probably a couple of rental houses because
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.320]   buying $500,000 rental houses is probably not a great rental market, but I would buy
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:32.520]   a couple of $250,000 rental houses, pay cash for them, and then I would put a maximum mortgage
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.040]   on my primary residence and I would use the cash flow from the rental houses to pay for
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:47.160]   my primary mortgage so that I'm not actually dipping into my capital. I'm maintaining
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   my asset base and I'm not spending capital on consumption. Rather, I'm turning capital
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.600]   into income and then I'm spending income on consumption. So that's what I would do. Now,
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.720]   if you don't want to buy rental houses, then fine, put it in an index fund or whatever
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.720]   it is that you want to invest it in, but maintain your capital and I don't see any reason for
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.340]   you not to get a mortgage. Now, the only thing that would be difficult is if you get a mortgage
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:15.680]   payment of $3,500 a month and you have a pension of $5,000 a month, that would be somewhat
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.840]   uncomfortable, especially if you're committed to not spending your capital. And so, of course,
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.240]   you could defray that by putting more money down on a property, which is kind of what
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.240]   you laid out. You're going to buy a $500,000 house, but you're going to put $250,000 down
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:36.040]   and that drops your mortgage down to a reasonable monthly amount that is comfortable given your
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:42.800]   pension situation, which you can do. That would work conceptually, but I like the idea,
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.760]   the personal challenge of saying, "I'm not going to spend capital. I want to get richer
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.640]   and richer every single day. I want to be richer tomorrow than I am today, which means
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.680]   I can't spend capital. I can only spend income." And I like the personal challenge of forcing
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.200]   myself to be productive because if I'm going to get richer every day, that means I've got
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.200]   to figure out how to grow the capital.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.440]   The final thing for you to consider, you are in a phase of life at which everything's going
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:13.400]   to change. Your son is in high school, which means he's still there. Your older sons are
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.760]   a little bit older, but your high school son would still enjoy and appreciate some of the
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:24.640]   benefits of a big house on the water and things like that. But very quickly, he'll be gone.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.480]   And so I would caution you to be very careful before all of a sudden you sign up and buy
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:34.760]   a six bedroom house on the water because if it's just you and your wife, there's a good
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:40.040]   chance that you're going to not need that some months from now or a couple of years
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.200]   from now when your other son is out of the house.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:49.520]   So I would just say, think carefully and move slow because it'd be silly to buy a $500,000
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.360]   house today when you can rent that $500,000 house for a few thousand dollars a month for
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:59.960]   the next couple of years. And then when Florida real estate market prices drop in a few years,
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:06.360]   you could easily buy a much more modest, comfortable home as your empty nest home and be much happier
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.600]   with also having less money out of pocket.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:14.800]   And you bring up an interesting point. I've actually considered that, Josh. And here's
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.160]   the dilemma that I'm kind of in, though. And you'll understand this being a Floridian,
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.280]   is that in Florida, you have two years from the time you sell your house to make that
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:30.200]   portability move, that portability rule, which helps also kind of keep your property tax
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:35.600]   from going, you know, getting too crazy, especially if you're going to buy up or similar to what
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.120]   you were in before.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:46.880]   And so I wrestle with that idea of the portability rule here in Florida. And do I want to miss
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:54.040]   out? But at the same time, I mean, I could like, I'm renting this condo or this apartment.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:00.080]   It's like $1,200 a month. It's half of what I was paying in my mortgage in South Florida.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.840]   It's very doable. It's very comfortable. And then, like you said, just continue to let
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:13.160]   that capital work for me, live off the income that I'm receiving monthly.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.440]   But again, at some point in time, I think I do want to buy a house. And that's not going
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.440]   to be a six bedroom. I mean, I think I would like to live a little bit closer to the beach.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.480]   I'm not going to be on the beach, but I think I'd like to be a little bit closer to the
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:33.440]   beach. I'm talking about hurricanes, but I do like that. I do like that lifestyle.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.640]   And so what are your thoughts about that? Is it worth foregoing the portability and
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.280]   just not even considering that?
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:48.800]   Well, calculate the numbers on what your personal tax portability would be. Calculate those
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:55.160]   numbers so that you know what they are. But I would guess just simply the phase of life
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:01.640]   that you're in. The house that you want to live in when you have children in the house
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.360]   is different than the house that you want to live in when you don't have children in
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:14.840]   the house. And the rents on luxury homes are often much more reasonable than buying those
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:20.520]   luxury homes. So if you want to rent a luxury home for the next few years, you could buy
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.400]   one. But the danger is, of course, you buy one and then the market changes and now you're
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.440]   the one holding it. So if I were in your shoes, I would give myself these goals.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.760]   One, I'm not going to spend capital because I want to be richer tomorrow than I am today.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:41.880]   Two, I want to build the perfect lifestyle or my most ideal lifestyle, reflecting the
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.560]   idea that I'm already financially independent. And I want to make sure that I'm living where
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.760]   I really want to live. If you tell me, Joshua, we want to live on the water, we want to dock
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   for the 38-foot boat out back, that's important. We want a luxury home. That's fine. You can
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.160]   figure it out.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160]   Right.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.200]   I mean, I've worked with a lot of people who've had big houses. I found that most people would
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:09.400]   rather, especially empty nesters, would rather have a smaller house in a beautiful townhouse,
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:15.960]   a beautiful condo, a beautiful apartment, a smaller house that has less work associated
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.480]   with it in a more luxury place with more amenities. And that's different than the house that you
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.920]   probably want right now when you still have children in the house. So those would be my
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.920]   suggestions.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.920]   Right.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920]   I mean, I'm not in the position of-
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.360]   That was two. That was two. What was third? You said-
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   On a mortgage?
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.840]   Not to spend the capital, build a life, and then a mortgage. Yeah.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.880]   Yeah. And on the mortgage, I would just challenge myself to say, "How can I put this money to
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.400]   work? Let me take the $500,000 tax-free that you got from the sale of your home. Let me
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.440]   take that money and turn that into investment capital." And so, again, you buy a handful
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:15:00.000]   of $250,000 homes, pay cash for them. That'll generate for you $3,000 a month of income,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.240]   and then use that $3,000 a month to pay your mortgage on your primary house rather than
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.520]   putting it all into consumption. That way, you're building your capital base. So that's
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:09.520]   what I would do.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.400]   Got you. Okay. All right. Great.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.240]   Bart, thanks for calling in. Keep me updated on what you do. I look forward to hearing
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:21.080]   from you. All right. We move now to Michigan. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:35.120]   Got a Michigan phone number, 248-AREA-CODE. Welcome. Can you hear me? Michigan, are you
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:42.640]   there? All right. We move on to Washington. Welcome, 202. Tell me your name and how I
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:53.200]   can serve you today, please. Hold on a second. I guess I'm not sure, but I got some tech
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.640]   problem here. All right. That didn't work. So let's go to Isaiah in California. Welcome
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.760]   to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:05.000]   Wow. Well, first of all, I just wanted to say thank you so much. And just all the things
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.200]   that you share, especially from your value perspective that you share with us, is really
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.280]   awesome and it's something we don't hear anywhere else. So I wanted to thank you for that, Josh.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.520]   My pleasure. Thank you. Yeah. I don't have a question in particular,
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:25.360]   but I guess I just kind of wanted to give you, like I've been kind of just listening
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.320]   to the things you say and giving a little rough outline for my future. And so right
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.660]   now where I'm at is I have a pretty steady job and I've been able to save a good amount
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:42.720]   of free cash that I've just been investing in individual stocks, ETFs, and international
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.660]   markets. And so the things I've been saving up for are, well, first of all, marriage.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:56.280]   So I've been saving up for a ring and then a house possibly. And I think overall, I was
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:02.840]   kind of going back to that lady from Canada. I think I'd like to get involved in the education,
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.520]   not with the state education system, but I was just kind of thinking of maybe starting
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:16.120]   a business that could help support a school that would be privately funded. And I think
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:24.000]   some of that would come from maybe buying and selling cars or maybe some type of like
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.520]   a farming system. But I just wanted to kind of get your input on that.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:35.920]   Well, there are a lot of career opportunities and compelling business opportunities in the
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:45.680]   world of education. It's kind of funny, one of the years ago I read a manual on how to
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:50.240]   build a system of daycares. I think the author was Nick Kozell. It was published by Gary
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.040]   North. I think he was involved in it. But the manual was how to build a series of Christian
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:02.120]   daycares and to make a lot of money off of them. And I thought the arguments made in
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:06.520]   the manual were very strong. I thought the business opportunity was significant. And
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.080]   I thought it's filed away in the back of my head as one of those things that if I ever
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.560]   decided that I wanted to dedicate my time in that direction, that I could build a series
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:23.720]   of daycares. And I think especially this is an area of where we as men have a major advantage,
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:30.200]   especially if you are a well-educated man and competent, because there's a major benefit
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.480]   because so many of the people who are involved in that business are women, that it's one
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.680]   of the areas that I think you could go into as a man and really stand out. But education
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.160]   is also the same way, whether that's as a teacher, whether it's as a school administrator.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:52.760]   I've talked to and listened to a number of people who run private schools, and you can
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:19:01.920]   do well and make a major impact on your students and also use it as a foundation for your financial
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.920]   growth. Now, you can do that within a more structured system, starting a local private
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.040]   school with buildings. I think there's a huge opportunity if you're interested in education
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:20.120]   right now. I think there's a tremendous opportunity for people to kind of blur the lines between
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:28.680]   an accredited school and, well, this is just one of my hunches. Now, I don't know if this
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.320]   is true. Somebody would have to test it. But if I were going to start a school, one of
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.960]   the things that I would personally try to pursue right now is I would have to investigate
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:42.880]   more about the system of accreditation, but I would ignore accreditation. And I would
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:49.800]   try to put together resources for parents to be involved in home education, but do it
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:55.160]   under the cover of somebody helping with some of the details of a place to go, a school
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.600]   building, helping with some administrative needs, helping them to have a place for children
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.440]   to be. Because there are a lot of people who are willing to take some measure of responsibility
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:09.480]   for their children's education, but they feel like they lack the facilities, they lack the
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:13.800]   competence to teach themselves, or perhaps what their work schedule is just doesn't work
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.080]   out. There are a lot of single parents who struggle to figure out how they could, to
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:23.800]   homeschool, etc. And so I think there's an opportunity to have a very low cost private
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:30.680]   school environment where the parents are actually the responsible parties in terms of the education
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:38.160]   quality, meaning you're not an accredited school, but you are providing a place for
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.360]   them to have teachers, to have enterprises, etc. So I think there are tons of things that
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.600]   can be done. I don't know if that idea would work. I've never researched the systems, but
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.720]   it's just one of those things in looking at it and talking to people. I know of almost
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:57.920]   no people, I know of very few people who, at least in my circle, who really want to
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.080]   send their children down to the government school. But there's a big difference between
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:08.680]   the ease of saying, "Okay, I don't want to do that," versus in my area, saying, "I'm
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.480]   going to spend $23,000 a year for one of the elite private schools." So I think that there
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.960]   is an opportunity for people to fill that few thousand dollar a year price tag, but
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.760]   to do it in some ways that take advantage of digital learning, do it in ways that take
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:26.760]   advantage of not having accredited teachers trying to do the teaching, but rather just
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:33.520]   having people who are facilitating the use of online instruction. And I think that's
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.160]   going to be significantly moved forward in the next few years. Time will tell if I'm
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.080]   right or not, but there are definitely opportunities that a young man could get involved in, and
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.160]   you can use it to build a business and also to make a significant impact in the lives
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.120]   of young men and women.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:56.800]   Yeah, I think it's really interesting that you bring that up because through my high
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.600]   school years, or junior high and freshman year of high school, I was homeschooled. And
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:09.760]   there was a local program here for homeschoolers where you attend individual classes. It wasn't
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.480]   like a full class day, but individual classes that you would sign up for and attend those
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.200]   classes twice a week.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:21.880]   Yeah, absolutely. And those things are growing more and more. And one of the things that
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:28.040]   has happened is even if you were using, for example, the state system, in Florida, we
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.560]   have an entire online virtual school. You can use the government's curriculum, you can
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.240]   use the government teachers, you can do all of that, but that still doesn't solve the
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:42.160]   problem for somebody who's struggling to figure out, "Well, who's going to supervise my child?"
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:47.160]   And they know they don't want to send their child into Parkland High School where they're
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.360]   going to get shot or they're going to get bullied or they're going to get drugged on
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:54.240]   a daily basis. They know they want to avoid that, but they're struggling to figure out,
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:59.240]   "How do I compensate for that?" And so, well, the market will have to prove it out, but
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:04.800]   I think there's probably a demand for that. And what we need is entrepreneurs to try it,
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.680]   put something together, put an offering to the market and see. And that's a good opportunity
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.720]   for young men to try those kinds of things. Because, for example, I have a friend of mine
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.560]   who is a college professor. And this college professor, I've talked about it, he's like,
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:23.040]   "Yeah, that's my idea." But he can't take the financial risk of walking away from his
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.920]   job in order to try it. But a young man can take that risk and you dedicate a year to
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.480]   it. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. If it does, it does. So I'd encourage
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:36.280]   you, this is the time in your life, you sound like you're closer to the young end of the
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.240]   spectrum. This is a time to take those risks and grab an idea, try it and see what works.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.040]   If it doesn't work, move on to the next one.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:51.240]   Do you think that, because a lot of my heart goes towards fatherless children who maybe
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:58.160]   aren't able to pay for that private education, however much it is. Do you think it's viable
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:04.560]   at all to focus on a separate business to help support the school? Or do you think it
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:09.440]   would be better to go directly into the school and start it that way?
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:18.240]   I think there's a third way. I share your heart. I personally have a deep burden for
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:24.160]   young men, especially young men who don't have a father figure in their life. So I share
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   that burden personally. But I don't think that school is necessarily the best solution
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:37.280]   for that. Young men who are academically skilled and gifted, they already have opportunities
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:43.840]   in school. If they are linguistically competent, if they're cognitively capable and they can
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.240]   do well in academics, then there are teachers who are already there who will come alongside
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:55.360]   and who will help them point them in another direction. The men who I see being laid aside
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:02.080]   by society are the men who don't have a high degree of cognitive ability. They're the men
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.760]   who don't do well in school. And one of the things that I have often wished for is I've
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:14.600]   wished for a business that was basic enough that I could hire young men in order to work
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:20.400]   with me where I could actually train them. Unfortunately, with my business, there's no
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.760]   way for me to use somebody who is unskilled. But I've worked with a number of entrepreneurs
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.560]   who do have that opportunity, and I'm jealous of them in terms of their ability. If I were
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:39.400]   you and if I had that kind of burden, I would seriously look to building some kind of business
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:45.560]   in the manual trades in some way. And what I would do is I would look at it as an opportunity
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:52.240]   to first of all, do very well financially. Because if you are... Here's what happens
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:59.480]   in kind of the sorting process that happens in the US American society. Smart people,
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:04.000]   people who have high cognitive ability and who do well academically, generally tend to
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:12.120]   sort themselves into careers that are more prestigious and that depend upon that significant
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.680]   cognitive ability. So if you're smart, you're going to be pointed in the direction of engineering
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:24.140]   or law or medicine, something like that. But if you take that same person, especially somebody
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:30.600]   with an entrepreneurial bent or a mind toward business, and you go into the trades, you
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:38.120]   have a significant advantage because of your intelligence, because of your cognitive ability.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.980]   Many people who are in the trades started off as basic laborers and they grew their
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:48.840]   business more by accident than with intention. I've done some consulting for a number of
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:56.360]   people and I think of one person who in particular, he's a tile setter. And today he owns a tile
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:01.960]   business, but he's never been a competent businessman. Rather, it was a tile setter
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:06.120]   who recognized that he couldn't afford to work on his knees for the rest of his life
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.280]   and he started to build a business. Well, I could go into that business and I could
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.880]   partner with him with the specific knowledge and I could apply business systems and modern
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.800]   marketing methods and tools, and I could make a major impact to that business. But there
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:26.160]   are very few people who are intelligent, have high cognitive ability, who choose to go into
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.600]   those low prestige industries and apply themselves. But if you do, you can do well.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.840]   One time I was sitting in a hot tub with some friends and I struck up a conversation with
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:40.440]   a guy. We were at a luxury condo here in South Florida and the guy owned a landscaping company.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.000]   It was a multimillionaire from a landscaping company. So the point is, I would rather have
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.640]   a landscaping company where I could bring in a young man who is struggling and I could
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:55.120]   say, "Listen, you don't have to do anything except do what you're told." And I would use
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:01.600]   work as the basic foundation to help him acquire some job skills, some soft skills, earning
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.320]   ability, et cetera. And I think that if you have that type of business, then you can use
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.520]   the business as a form of charity and you can hire people that you wouldn't otherwise
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.680]   hire. And you can be a little bit more patient with people who you would otherwise not be
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:19.720]   patient with because as the entrepreneur, it's your right to do that. So that's the
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:26.440]   direction I would go. I don't think charitable enterprises should generally be able to earn
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:31.600]   their own way. And I do think there are things that need just money where you can give money.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:37.360]   But if you give money, you generally will create a culture of an enterprise that will
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.440]   constantly be just sucking down money and doesn't do anything. Better to start a business
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:49.120]   or figure out how to earn an income from something and use that as the foundation so it can support
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:56.960]   itself. I love the story of the Trappist monks. And with this, I'll give you one more comment,
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.880]   Isaiah, and I'll move on to the next caller. But if you think about the monks, you have
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.160]   to figure out, they say, "Okay, we want to live this lifestyle where we're living in
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.000]   a monastery, but we've got to figure out how to support ourselves." They come up with ways
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.560]   to serve. And so you've got the Trappist monks that brew beer or the monks that do all these
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.240]   different things. They're much stronger as a monastery. They're much stronger as a religious
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:20.760]   order than those that continually are out soliciting donations because they actually
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.320]   bring something to the world. And so I don't want to start a business giving... I don't
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:31.640]   want to start a charity giving classes to young men. They don't need to sit in school.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.640]   What they need is they need a job and they need a foreman and they need someone who will
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.800]   come alongside and pick them up in the morning and who'll make sure that they're there. I
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:45.060]   have a client of mine who does this very effectively as a roofing company. And he brings in people
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:50.000]   who you shouldn't really hire them. They're losers. They're failures at life, but he comes
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.520]   alongside and he calls them and he wakes them up and he goes gets them and he makes sure
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:30:00.400]   to feed them and whatnot. And he's a father to them. And they need that kind of input.
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.340]   So I'd encourage you, build something. And if you have a desire for that, just build
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:08.240]   a business where you don't have to hire people with college degrees. Build a business where
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.840]   you can hire somebody and give them an opportunity to develop themselves within the context of
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.840]   work.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:22.800]   Thank you so much. Yeah, that gives me a lot to work with. My heart isn't really, you know,
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:28.680]   I've never really been focused on retiring, but I just, yeah, I just want to get involved
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:36.200]   and be a father to people. Especially young men. I just, yeah, I just see a need. So that
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.200]   gives me a lot to work with in terms of where to fit in.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.760]   Absolutely. Well, we share that desire. So keep in touch. And as you find examples or
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.560]   people who are doing or you have ideas, send them to me and I'll try to give them a little
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:53.040]   bit of publicity. All right, Carla in Michigan, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today,
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.040]   please?
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:31:01.880]   I thank you very much for all the good information that you provide on your podcast. I am a regular
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:14.320]   listener, a fan of yours, and I also follow Dave Ramsey. The reason why I wanted to listen
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:21.120]   today, I didn't know I would be on, but I'm in a situation where I'm in a turning point
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:29.240]   in my life. My kids, my last son just went off to college. So I am officially an empty
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:41.360]   nester. I'm not married. I live in an apartment. And right now, financially, most of all of
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:52.440]   my money is in a 401k. And I have about $15,000 cash that I save, you know, just doing the
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:59.200]   Dave Ramsey baby steps, you know, making sure you have money set aside in case of emergency.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:08.320]   So I'm doing that. And my... Being an empty nester, I wanted to start about starting,
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:15.800]   finally starting my own business. I work full time. So I thought about, you know, different
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:24.400]   businesses such as retailing, Amazon, that sort of thing. But my question was regarding
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:32.880]   real estate. I lost my home in 2008 during the down market, and I was debating on whether
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:40.560]   or not I should even buy another home. I've been in an apartment since that time, and
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:48.760]   I like the convenience. No tax write-off, obviously. But I really, really like the convenience
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:33:05.160]   of not owning a home. You know, the responsibility of a home. Fifteen years old, you know, I
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:06.160]   don't know.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.280]   So do you feel like you are supposed to buy a house?
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:18.040]   I feel like I'm supposed to buy a house. I was taught to buy a house. You know, everyone
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:24.800]   in my family owns, you know, their home. My grandmother, God bless her, she's 90 years
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:32.600]   old. She owns her home. My mother owns her home. And, you know, and it's very... I see
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:37.040]   them being very secure, and I'm glad that they do have a home because obviously they're
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:47.280]   retired now, and they have a place of their own. But for me, I'm thinking that I may want
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:53.320]   to travel a little bit, and I don't... I just don't want the headache of it. You know, I
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:34:00.040]   don't know. And I'm thinking that if I had a business, that I can still reach some of
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:06.000]   the benefits tax-wise. You know, I may not have the mortgage interest and stuff like
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.240]   that, but I can still write off, you know, investment-wise as far as having a home. But
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:20.880]   I can offset that by having my own business and just stay as a renter. And I'm just wondering
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.160]   if you thought.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:32.240]   So a little bit of background history on kind of the concept of home ownership. I would
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:39.200]   not defend either of the extreme cases around home ownership. I wouldn't defend the idea
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:46.140]   that owning a house is a significant security, but I also wouldn't defend the idea that nobody
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:51.920]   should own a house. The correct answer, which is frustrating, I think, is it depends. It
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:59.600]   depends on the circumstances. First, I think in the past, owning a house was a much more
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:08.560]   stable form of security for two reasons. One, you had a higher respect for property rights
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:20.120]   than I see today. And two, you had fewer security blankets in society than you have today. So
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:24.360]   the first of property rights, I think, is really important. In the past, it seems to
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:30.640]   me that you could defend the idea that because I own this house, I own it and nobody can
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:36.680]   tell me what to do with it. It's mine and nothing can happen to it. Unfortunately, I
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:43.200]   have entirely, basically entirely relinquished that notion. And on whatever level you want
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:48.080]   to argue it, whether you want to argue it on a level of taxation, because of the fact
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:53.200]   that today, if you don't pay your taxes, the government could kick you off of your land,
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:58.560]   that we don't have an allodial title system. If we want to open up that can of worms, like
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:04.080]   some people would like, you know, you basically, you can be kicked off of your land and you
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:09.360]   could be kicked out of your house by all kinds of people and for all kinds of reasons, which
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.760]   are is really, really frustrating. And so those, again, range from things like you don't
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.660]   pay your property taxes because if you don't rent your land from the government, then they'll
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:24.280]   take it. You get kicked out by a mortgage company. If you buy a house that is part of
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:28.760]   a homeowner's association and you don't pay your homeowner's dues, then the homeowner's
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:34.160]   association can foreclose on you. I had a situation with a house that I bought. I had
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:40.360]   chickens in my backyard and some anonymous person complained to the government that I
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.120]   had chickens in my backyard, even though I had a half acre lot. And the government comes
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.180]   by and they cited me for having chickens in my backyard. They cited me for having a hedge
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:54.640]   that was too high. They cited me for having a shed, which was 40 years old, but it was
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:00.800]   unpermitted. And if I didn't reckon, if I didn't reckon, improve these things, then
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.960]   they would build, they would start charging me a thousand dollars up to a thousand dollars
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:09.520]   a day penalty that would be held as a lien on my property. Well, that's kind of a hard
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:14.040]   thing to stomach, you know? And so I had to, I had to get rid of my chickens and I had
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:20.080]   to cut my hedge and then I had to tear down what was probably a $15,000 shed simply because
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.280]   somebody who built it back in the eighties didn't apply for the appropriate government
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:31.880]   permitting process. So I don't hold any illusions about the ownership of property anymore. And
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:37.120]   I think that's different because I bet your mother, your grandmother would probably believe
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.960]   that, well, if you own a house, it's yours and you can do what you want. Well, I'm sorry.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:45.000]   No, you can't. You can't take out the front window and change the front window without
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.880]   applying for a government license. You can't add onto the kitchen. You can't, you can't
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.200]   do anything with your house without applying for permission. So who owns it? You don't
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:58.780]   own it. Now that's the, that's kind of an extreme case, but I think it's worth recognizing
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:04.080]   because I think there is an age gap and a generational difference that should be reckoned
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:09.880]   with. You know, my grandfather, when he owned a house, it was his house. He could do whatever
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:15.160]   he wanted with it. He didn't have to apply for a permit to swap out a hot water heater
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:20.320]   as in today. So that's changed. And unless you live in one of the very few places where
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.960]   you can still avoid some of the government interference, that is changed. Now, on the
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.480]   flip side, the other thing about a house is a house represented a significant form of
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:38.360]   shelter and protection. If you go back, you know, 75 years, just consider what it was
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.720]   like if you didn't have a house, a place to keep you warm at night or a place to keep
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:46.800]   you cool. But a house was much more basic. It was just, it was providing for those needs.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:54.600]   Today, given the proliferation of safety systems, if you're hungry, you can get free food from
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:58.080]   the government. If you don't have a place to stay, you can get all kinds of free places
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:04.880]   to stay. If you can get free rent paid with Section 8 housing, if you don't have medical
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.240]   care, you can get free medical care. So the safety net that was once represented by the
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:18.280]   house has, I think, largely minimized itself in terms of its actual value. So, because
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:24.400]   there are other government programs that are providing that same safety net. So that's
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.920]   kind of my analysis of it first, in terms of saying it can be fine to own a house. You
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.840]   do get some more freedom. You do get some more liberties that you may not get in an
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:40.560]   apartment, but you also do get a significant amount of responsibility. The other thing
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:45.760]   that has changed is the fact that people used to think that a house was a guaranteed gold
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:54.040]   mine of money. And that was because up until 2008, for the 20 or 30 years prior to 2008,
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:58.880]   the single best asset that most people owned that made them more money was their house.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:05.760]   Well, that bubble burst in 2008, as you personally experienced. And I think today nobody really
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.500]   believes that. And I would say there's no way that it can be, because housing cannot
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.680]   outstrip real wages on the long term. It really can't, because people are, at the end of the
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.240]   day, are going to say, "I'm not going to live here." So should you buy a house? You shouldn't
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.240]   buy a house if you don't want to. I think you need security. I think that's helpful,
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:30.600]   especially for you as a single woman. You need to build for yourself that security blanket.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:36.360]   But you can build that in many ways. You can build that with a house, but in some ways
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:41.160]   a house is actually insecure, because if your job disappears, but you have a house, you
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:44.400]   can't freely move. Whereas if you live in an apartment, you can freely move across the
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:50.120]   country to where there's work. You can build that security with having money, having savings.
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:55.240]   That builds a significant security blanket around you. You can build that security blanket
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:59.700]   in many ways. And I don't think you should buy a house unless you want to buy a house.
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:06.540]   And I would agree with you that a house is a significant responsibility. And it's probably
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:12.520]   not one that you would want at this phase of your life, unless you really do for some
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:18.240]   reason. But rather, build your security blanket in other ways, and then choose whatever housing
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:21.880]   decision works for you.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:29.320]   I appreciate you. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to build my security blanket
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:39.560]   in other ways, and not in the single thought that a house will be it. Because obviously
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:47.040]   I survived without it. And I haven't won, and that's exactly what happened in 2008.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.200]   You lose your job, you lose your house. And that's exactly what happened. So I lost my
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:42:05.320]   job and my house obviously wasn't paid for. So I lost it. So yes, I need to build my security
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:14.640]   in other ways. So thank you for your sound advice. I think that's your gift to us.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640]   Thank you.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:24.160]   And I think the gift of looking at both sides and helping us make a good sound decision
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:35.240]   when sometimes we can get kind of cloudy and get down in the minutiae a little bit. And
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.400]   so I really appreciate you doing this for us. Thank you very much.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:42.560]   It's my pleasure. And let me just make a couple of recommendations to you from what you've
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:50.420]   shared first. The most effective security blanket will be found in your local community.
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:58.600]   So that community can be as close as your family. That community can be with your friends,
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:03.440]   if you're part of a church or some other community organization. But that's going to be the most
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.900]   effective security that you can have for yourself. And so I would recommend that you just think
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:13.760]   about that and continue to prioritize building that. So continue to build into the lives
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.080]   of your children. Just because they're out of your house doesn't mean they're out of
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:24.880]   your life. And I think that continuing to sow into them, if you will respect the change
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.860]   that they're making in life, where now they are independent adults, not dependent children.
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:38.600]   But if you continue to build into them, that can continue to flourish. And depending on
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.320]   how stable your children are and what you can do to help them be stable, that will always
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:50.760]   be your security blanket. One of the things that really bothers me is that many people
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:58.960]   in your generation look forward and ignore the value of being with family. And I'm concerned
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:05.680]   because it seems that's a very lonely path through life. To believe that you have to
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:12.440]   do it all and that you have to do it all independently because you're the mother will rob you of
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:19.360]   the joy of being able to be with your children and with your family. And it's really concerning.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:25.520]   And the data is actually pretty clear on that. People who are in the second half of life
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:35.260]   usually often experience significant mental loneliness, significant sense of isolation.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:39.520]   And it shouldn't be that way. Our society is sick in the way that we treat old people
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.600]   and young people because you shouldn't have this idea that, okay, I'm going to reach this
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:49.880]   certain age and I'm going to be off by myself and I got to figure it out. One of the things
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:54.920]   that we should be looking forward to and we should be cultivating is we should be cultivating
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:03.720]   as a culture an appreciation for the wisdom that comes with age. And it's hard to know
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.240]   how to apply this generally, of course, when people from different backgrounds and different
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:15.320]   situations. But I get so frustrated at how in our culture, we only just look at youth
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:21.040]   and beauty and we don't appreciate age and wisdom. And that is wrong. We should appreciate
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.860]   age and wisdom and you should look forward to the next half of your life and you should
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:32.680]   look forward to being sought upon as a valuable source of wisdom, as a valuable source of
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:39.800]   insight. Your life experience up till now has given you the ability to see situations
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:45.920]   in a different light. And it's to our shame as US Americans that we despise the wisdom
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:52.560]   of the elderly and we praise the beauty of the young and usually foolish. So that should
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.560]   change. So continue to sow into the lives of your children because they will look for
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.900]   that. Now, depending on their age, usually they need to get into their thirties before
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:06.520]   they start to appreciate mom a little bit more. But that's a significant source of security,
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.800]   right? You sounded like you want to be youngest is just out of the house. Usually it takes
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:16.520]   a little bit of time. But I think if you make it clear, if you make it clear that you want
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.280]   to continue to be involved in the lives of your children, then they can continue to be
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:24.040]   involved. And that will be something that will be beneficial. And the other thing is
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:30.640]   in terms of the community, focus on building for yourself a community that will support
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.720]   you, that will love you, that will care for you, because that's where most of the security
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:40.760]   of life comes from. If you have that community behind you, whether it's through a close family,
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:44.800]   through an extended family, through a church family, through a community organization that
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:51.600]   you're involved in, then that community will support you if you're ever in need and that
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.480]   community will stand behind you. And those are the things that are really valuable. And
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.400]   then along the way, continue to be prudent with your money, save money, stockpile the
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.400]   things that you need, make sure that you never become in a situation where you're financially
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:10.360]   vulnerable, and then you'll figure out the path forward. But a house does not automatically
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:16.400]   mean safety. It just is a house. So I think you're on the right track. Those are my thoughts.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.440]   And thank you for your kind words, Carla. I appreciate you calling in.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440]   Carla Enns Thank you.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:26.720]   We go now, let's see, Washington, DC for our final caller. Are you there? Tell me your
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.720]   name, please, and how I can serve you today.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.480]   Dan Fletcher Hi, Joshua. Can you hear me okay?
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:33.480]   Yes, now I can hear you. Tell me your name, please.
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:39.040]   Dan Fletcher My name is Dan. We've spoken before on a consult
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:44.760]   call, and I think it was about a similar topic that I have a question about tonight about
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:53.240]   life insurance. I am just starting school again, going back to graduate school. I'm
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:48:01.560]   30 years old, and I'm married to a woman who has a consulting job, and I'll be a dependent
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:09.720]   on her benefits, because I'm also working part time, but going off of benefits because
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:22.600]   of that. So I do have a whole life policy that I inherited it from my parents. I think
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:32.640]   it's either a $50,000 or $100,000 whole life policy. I've been paying it since I moved
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:39.240]   out because they said it was a good deal. I think it's around like $400 or $500 a year
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:47.640]   that I'm paying. So basically, I'm wondering if I need to sign up for my, you know, via
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:53.520]   my wife's benefit as a dependent, if I need to sign up for life insurance, in addition
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:49:01.920]   to what I'm already paying. I understand that, you know, that's a difficult question, you
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.360]   know, not knowing more about my life situation, but it's really just the two of us. We're
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:15.600]   probably going to have kids in a couple years. I will get back on benefits and have the opportunity
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.920]   to purchase life insurance through them again, I'm sure in the next couple years after I'm
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:30.040]   done with med school. I mean, essentially, it boils down to is the $50,000 or $100,000
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:36.120]   I currently have in life insurance enough and am I paying too much for it?
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:42.680]   Tom: Short answer, probably it's not enough money and probably you're not paying too much
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.440]   for it. But let me ask a couple of questions to make sure of your situation and then I'll
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:53.920]   defend those quick answers just a little bit. How much money is your wife earning currently?
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:50:00.720]   She makes about, I think it's about $100,000 a year.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:08.080]   Okay. So with her earning $100,000, you guys are not financially destitute and these decisions
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:15.120]   are not going to be significant. They're not going to be material in your day-to-day cash
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:21.080]   flow. That would be different than if your wife is earning $30,000 per year and you guys
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.600]   are scrimping and saving to live in a tiny little apartment while you go back to grad
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.840]   school. Those would be different. But given her level of income, everything we're going
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:36.040]   to talk about in the coming minutes is going to be, with regard to the impact to your lifestyle,
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:41.720]   financially insignificant. So let's talk about do you need life insurance or not? There'll
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:46.520]   be two answers to the question and depends on how you approach the analysis of do you
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:56.600]   need life insurance. Many people look at life insurance and they say, "Well, if I die, what
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:04.080]   do I need to, what's the bare minimum that I've got to cover?" And by that analysis,
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:09.880]   you probably don't need life insurance. You don't have children. I'm going to guess, correct
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:13.400]   me if I'm wrong, but I'm going to guess that your financial situation is stable. You're
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:19.200]   not deeply in debt. You're not getting for bankruptcy. Your wife has an excellent income.
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:24.400]   She is well-qualified in the career world. And if you died, she would continue to be
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:31.800]   financially stable. So you would not be drop, shirking your responsibility. You wouldn't
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:36.720]   leave her destitute. You're going to be okay. That's fine. And that's a reasonable way to
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:40.280]   approach it. And so many people would say, "I don't need life insurance, so I shouldn't
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:46.840]   own any." Now, another way to look at it would be to say, "Are we investing into my career
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:54.120]   and into my income? And would it be very unfortunate if I died, especially while I'm in college?"
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:58.840]   And by that metric, I think you can make a compelling case that it would be in your wife's
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:05.880]   best interest for her to own a life insurance policy on your life. And it would be in your
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:12.320]   best interest for you to own a life insurance policy on her life. Think about it. She is,
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:17.600]   right now, carrying the financial load for the earning of your family while you are in
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:23.900]   school. And not only does that mean that you are not contributing financially an income
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:29.560]   to the family right now, but you're costing money in expenses and you're investing into
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:35.760]   the tuition for your graduate school. And so by that metric, if you died, although your
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.640]   wife would not be kicked out of the house, she wouldn't be destitute on the streets,
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.360]   she would be losing a significant amount of money on her investment. Now, if you died
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:53.080]   and you have a $500,000 life insurance policy, that would go a long way towards helping her
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:58.720]   to recoup her investment in you with the time, the labor, and the money that, in effect,
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:03.640]   she's spending on you in her marriage. That would go a long way towards making her financially
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:09.000]   whole and it would certainly help her to be able to grieve for you and to feel like she
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.080]   has enough money to be able to figure out what's next for her while she figures out
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:18.080]   how to put her life together. Now, the great thing is, because life insurance is so stinking
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:24.840]   cheap, especially for, you said you were 30, I think you said, right? 30? Okay. 30, non-smoker?
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:31.960]   Yeah. Okay. So you could buy a half a million dollar term life insurance policy for $300,000,
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:38.600]   $400 a year, under $500 a year, depending on what type of policy you buy. So in a household
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:46.640]   income of $100,000, where your wife is investing into your expenses, into your tuition, et
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:53.400]   cetera, with her earning, does it make sense to spend $300 for a $200,000 life insurance
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:58.420]   policy, $500 a year for a half a million dollar policy? I think there's a really compelling
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:04.720]   case there. And so if I were sitting with her, I would say, "Listen, just go ahead and
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.800]   buy it. I think it'd be worth it." And this is the same advice I give to parents who have
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:13.320]   an 18 year old child and they're putting their child through school. It's like, just go ahead
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:19.160]   and buy a $250,000 term life insurance policy on your 18 year old. Once a child turns 18,
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:24.800]   you can buy term life insurance. Like you're putting, you're investing money into your
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:30.500]   child, into their education, into their support. There's no reason in the world for you not
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:36.000]   to go ahead and have a life insurance policy on them. And it's so cheap to do that, okay,
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.480]   so you spent a few hundred dollars on it and you decided, and thankfully your child is
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:44.880]   alive or your spouse is alive, that's fine. But there's no reason not to. Make sense?
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:50.000]   That makes total sense. And that's a different way than I had thought about it before. So
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.840]   I really appreciate that. Would you say convert it, like, can I convert my whole life into
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:03.120]   term or how does that work? Like with the policy that I currently have, it's not through,
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.120]   you know, it's independent of any corporate benefit package.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.280]   Right. What company is your whole life insurance policy with?
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.480]   I think it's New York Life.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:21.080]   So the short answer to your question, can you convert it into term insurance? No, you
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:28.360]   can never convert a whole life insurance policy into a term life insurance policy and keep
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.600]   the whole life insurance policy in force. Let me explain actually how you could convert
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:38.760]   it. But first let me explain why. Whole life insurance is expensive when measuring the
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:45.920]   premium dollars. And the reason it's expensive is because it's in force for your whole life
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:56.200]   until you die. Your policy is probably, what's the word for the people who do all the calculations,
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:02.080]   the actuary, it's actuarily planned out to age 120 probably. So it's in force for your
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.160]   whole life. So that makes the premium very high as compared to the death benefit. Now,
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:12.000]   if you found out that you were going to get cancer, you had cancer, and then you would
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.640]   have a very much an incentive just to switch it to term life insurance and say, well, I
[01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:21.680]   got cancer, I'm going to die. And that would result in an adverse selection problem for
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:27.040]   the insurance company. So you can never convert a whole life insurance policy to a term life
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:34.000]   insurance policy just as a way of automatic conversion. Now, you do have one option where
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.600]   it is possible if you didn't want the policy anymore, you could convert the cash value
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:45.760]   in the policy to what's called extended term protection. So one of your non forfeiture
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:51.440]   benefits that you have in a whole life insurance policy, if you don't want the policy anymore,
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.660]   you have a certain amount of cash value. Do you know how much cash value your policy has
[01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:55.660]   in it right now?
[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:56.660]   >>ANDREW: I do not.
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:57:03.980]   >>STEVE: Okay. Let's pretend it has $3,000 of cash value in the policy. So if you're
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:09.240]   policy has $3,000 of cash value, you could say to the insurance company, listen, I don't
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:16.220]   want the policy anymore. I don't want it. But what I will do is I'll take the $3,000
[01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:22.440]   and I want you to give me the extended term insurance as part of the non forfeiture benefits
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:28.200]   for the policy. And so what the insurance company would do, they would calculate how
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:35.400]   many months or years of insurance the $3,000 would buy for a 30 year old male. And they
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:41.440]   would give you that number of years of insurance. So maybe that would buy you 13 years of insurance
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:47.600]   coverage at the $50,000 level of the policy currently is. So you can do that. You could
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:53.520]   convert the cash value into the extended term insurance and they would just give you 13
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.400]   years of coverage. And if you die in the next 13 years, they would pay your wife $50,000.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.400]   If you don't die in the next 13 years, then they wouldn't. And it would just be just like
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:07.960]   any other term insurance policy. Now that doesn't work in your situation because it
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:13.520]   didn't approach the numbers of insurance that we were talking about. Notice when I was talking
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:19.080]   about, Hey, your wife should have insurance. I moved right on past your 25 or $50,000 policy
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:24.960]   and I jumped right up to two, three, four, $500,000 of insurance. So it doesn't really
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:29.120]   solve anything to have the $50,000 of insurance. So I wouldn't recommend that you pursue it.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:37.960]   Do you know how old you were when your parents bought this policy for you?
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:44.960]   I know it's been, I would guess college age. So let's say 10 years and you're at 500 bucks
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:45.960]   a year.
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:46.960]   Okay.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:47.960]   So with 10 years-
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:48.960]   500 bucks.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:53.920]   Yeah. With 10 years at 500 bucks a year, my guess would be that your policy, and do you
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.640]   know whether it was $25,000 or $50,000 that was issued at?
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:58:59.640]   I think it's 50.
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:05.800]   Okay. So your $50,000 policy, you probably have maybe $4,000 of cash value would be my
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:10.840]   guess somewhere in the fours on a policy like that with a company like New York Life. So
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:17.720]   here's what you need to do. Call your New York Life agent if you know who that is, or
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:23.400]   your parents' agent, and/or just call the local New York Life office and tell them,
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:29.560]   "I need an agent," and order what's called an in-force illustration for your policy.
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:34.040]   An in-force illustration is a financial ledger that will show what's actually happening in
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:40.080]   the policy. And my guess would be that at this point in the maturity of your policy,
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:46.080]   any money that you put into the premiums is paying the policy, it's keeping the policy
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:50.120]   in force of the death benefit, but you're probably at the point where just about all
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:56.400]   the money that you're putting in in premiums is going directly into the cash values. Depending
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:00.640]   on how the policy was structured, I can't answer all this stuff for sure, but it would
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:04.880]   probably be at this point where when you send in $500, your cash value is probably increased
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:10.680]   by 500 and something dollars, which means that your analysis here is partly on the basis
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:16.680]   of life insurance and is partly on the basis of the cash values. And in short, if you'll
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:21.940]   order the in-force illustration, you'll call a life insurance agent and you'll review it
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:26.280]   with that life insurance agent, have them explain to you the policy, explain how it
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:31.480]   works, et cetera. Probably where you'll wind up is you'll just say, "It's a good policy.
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:36.220]   I'll keep it. That way I've always got some amount of whole life insurance." And then
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:39.560]   you just go ahead and supplement it. If you want some more insurance, go ahead and supplement
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:43.800]   it with some term insurance. That can be through your work or that can just be a cheap term
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:48.600]   policy that you buy from the same agent. The same agent can sell you a cheap term policy.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:55.160]   But it's a good policy to have. Whole life insurance policies really stink if they're
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.080]   only kept for a short amount of time. And the reason is because all the expenses are
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:04.360]   front loaded. So if your parents had bought the policy, kept it for three years, and then
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:07.600]   canceled it, they would have lost all their money. But they didn't. They bought it and
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:11.560]   then they transferred it to you when you came of age. And so once you reach the point in
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:15.960]   a policy like this, where it's 10 years old or so, it's a mature policy. It can be a very
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:22.080]   flexible financial asset. And you can own it. You can use it. You can have access to
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:26.320]   the cash if you needed it. Doesn't sound like you need it. At this point in time, I would
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.960]   probably just keep paying the premiums. But you'll need to understand how it works. You
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:33.280]   need to understand when it would become paid up. You need to understand what the premium
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.880]   schedule is. You need to understand what's happening with the cash value. And those questions
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:40.560]   can only be answered by an in-force illustration from that company.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:46.440]   Beautiful. Yeah, that's another question that I had had about it was, you know, whether
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:50.960]   it's like a fungible asset that I can take cash from if I wanted to.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:54.680]   Yeah, it is. It is. So what I...
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:00.840]   In a situation like yours, what I'm most like about things like, or the use of a whole life
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:06.320]   insurance policy, this policy is too small to be really meaningful for you at this point
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:11.600]   in time. I mean, your household income is significant, and this asset is relatively
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:18.240]   insignificant in regards to the cash value. But as it grows, I think cash value, cash
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:24.240]   values are best viewed as a component of your emergency fund at this stage of your life.
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:29.480]   And the reason is the money is very, very stable. New York Life, especially, it's a
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:33.640]   great company. They do a good job with their investment portfolio. They do a good job with
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:38.840]   their dividend rates. And so the money will only ever go up. So you have an account that
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.200]   has money in it that will only ever go up. That's helpful because it means that you can
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:49.560]   count on the stability of that cash account. Now, the rate at which it'll go up will vary,
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:53.080]   obviously, depending on what the dividend rate is, depending on the investment portfolio,
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:58.360]   etc. But it's guaranteed to go up and it's very stable. So you can count on it as you
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:03.680]   can count on things like savings accounts. But given the fact that in the life insurance
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:08.680]   policy, you have the benefits of it being sheltered from taxes, the inside buildup of
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:13.440]   cash values in a life insurance policy are not taxed year by year. So it's sheltered
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:20.440]   from from taxes. You also have the benefit of it being protected from the claims of creditors.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.760]   Life insurance cash values are generally protected from the claims of creditors. You have the
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:29.660]   benefit of it being a fairly private asset. It's not reported in the same way that other
[02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:34.080]   investment accounts and other savings accounts are. And you have the ability to access the
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:38.760]   money fairly quickly if you need it. So you could call New York Life and they could wire
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:43.480]   you money in 24 hours you could have up to you can borrow out of a cash value policy
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:47.760]   like that you can borrow up to about 90% of the cash value. So what I like to look at
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:53.160]   policies like that at your phase of life is as a component of your emergency fund. If
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:58.560]   you had an emergency, you can start to use savings that you should also keep on hand
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.940]   liquid savings, but then you can use credit cards, and you can use credit cards to pay
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:06.560]   whatever you need to pay. And then if you need to access and pay those credit cards
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.680]   off, you can just take the money from the credit from the cash and put it into the credit
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:15.960]   cards. And what I think works really well is if you use that as a an asset that can
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:21.800]   be filled and replenished and then used, and then use it to sometimes you borrow from it,
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:25.960]   sometimes you borrow from other sources. So let's say that you had a financial emergency
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:32.000]   and you ran out of money. If you have $30,000 sitting in a cash value life insurance policy,
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.240]   you could use that. But what I would do is I would keep that asset as collateral and
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:40.600]   I would take out a 0% credit card offer. And I would borrow the money on a credit card
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:44.600]   at 0% knowing that I can always pay that off with my cash values if I want to surrender
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:49.360]   the asset. And then if I run into a situation where all of a sudden my utilization ratio
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:55.280]   gets too high on my credit management system, I would take the money out of the cash value
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:00.520]   life insurance policy, pay down the credit card, wait for my credit score to come up
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:05.320]   because my credit utilization ratio goes down. Then I would apply for another 0% credit card
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.240]   and I would go ahead and use that one. And then I would replenish the money back into
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:12.520]   the cash value policy. So when you have a stable asset like that, and if you're very
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:17.360]   disciplined about your money, it can actually be really useful because it gives you a lot
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:21.360]   of options to access other forms of financing. Now, if those other forms of financing aren't
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:24.680]   available, you can't take out a credit card, you can't get a loan, you don't have any other
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.520]   savings, you can always just either borrow the money, keep the policy in force, or you
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:34.080]   just cash it out and use the money. But it's it's really useful from that perspective.
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:38.600]   So the challenge is just it's too small, probably at this point to be a big deal. But if I woke
[02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:43.080]   up in your shoes, I would keep the policy most likely order the enforce illustration,
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:46.960]   make sure it's a healthy policy, do that analysis with an agent. But I would keep the policy
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:49.920]   and I would buy some additional cheap term life insurance.
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:57.760]   Awesome. And keeping the policy just is paying the premium each year, right?
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:02.560]   Right. And ask the agent like if you don't have the money, let's say paying that $500
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:08.600]   premium is actually a hardship for you. Because you're in your concern, ask the agent. If
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:13.400]   you can quick pay the policy, or ask the agent if you can adjust the dividend option, see
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:17.720]   if the policy you know what the dividends are on the policy. If you can't pay it, you
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:22.280]   can always use the money in the cash values to pay the premium for a few years. So your
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:26.480]   policy will have an option on it called an automatic premium loan. So if you just chose
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:30.960]   not to pay it for the next three years while you're in graduate school, it will take the
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:36.240]   annual premiums from the cash value and pay itself. So you can keep it in force without
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:41.080]   paying it. And then three years from now, you could decide to pick up the premiums and
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:45.080]   go ahead and pay off that loan if you want to. Another option that you'll have is you
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:49.760]   could use the dividends. Let's say the dividends on it are $200 by now, and the premium is
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:54.880]   $500. Well, you can use the dividends to reduce the payment, the premium that you owe, and
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:07:02.200]   you would just pay $300. Or if you don't want to pay any premiums in the future, the agent
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:06.160]   can go over your non-forfeiture options. You could take the policy paid up. So maybe by
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:14.120]   now the paid up option would be $15,000. So you could just say, "I don't want to take
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:18.480]   the cash out. I don't need the money, but I want to take the policy paid up." So they
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:23.840]   would just issue you a policy of $15,000. They could give you the cash value back if
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:27.600]   you needed it. That's probably your worst option. Or again, you could take the extended
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.720]   term insurance option for your non-forfeiture benefit. But those are all questions that
[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:33.840]   the insurance agent will answer for you.
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:40.480]   >>Toby: Awesome. Thank you so much, Joshua. You are invaluable, and I'm sure I will call
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:41.480]   you on a consult again.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:45.680]   >>Joshua: I'm so glad you did. It was super fun. I love doing these questions. They stimulate
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:50.440]   my creativity, and I enjoy doing them. Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:55.640]   I hope you've enjoyed the Q&A show. Keep an eye on your feed. Today's show was a feed
[02:07:55.640 --> 02:08:01.920]   that was available to any listener. But keep an eye, and I'll do these more and more from
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:07.680]   time to time. I'm doing my best to stay consistent with my Q&A schedule. Just the challenge is
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:10.920]   whether I have a stable internet schedule and can do it, but this worked out for me
[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:14.360]   to do it. So thank you so much for listening, and I'll be back with you very soon.
