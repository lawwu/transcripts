[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   God so loved the world that he sent his son into it.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500]   That's what we celebrate this week, the birth of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.000]   the incarnation of God in the flesh, Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.500]   So, of course, we can ask the question, "Why?"
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500]   Why was the eternal Son of God born in a manger?
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500]   Why was he enfleshed? Why did he need a body?
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.500]   This obviously is at the very heart of the incarnation, and to explain,
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.500]   here is a sermon clip from John Piper as we find him preaching his way through the Gospel of John,
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.500]   and particularly as he and the church approach the Christmas season of 2009.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500]   Here he is to explain the purpose of Christ's incarnation.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:53.500]   There is no Christmas story, no traditional birth of Jesus story in the Gospel of John.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.500]   We're still in the Gospel of John, still in chapter 6, but we're stepping back to get a bigger picture now
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.500]   of how Christmas is woven into this Gospel.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.500]   It doesn't have a story at the beginning like Luke does and Matthew does.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.500]   Instead, the Christmas story is woven through the Gospel,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   and its meaning is given repeatedly in the Gospel.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.500]   So it begins, the first verse of the book, "In the beginning was the Word,
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   So all the way back into eternity, there was the Word, and this mysterious statement,
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   "The Word was God," and paradoxically, "The Word was with God."
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.500]   Was God with God? And immediately you're into weighty Trinitarian matters, aren't you?
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   I mean, you don't have to go reading theology books to know that's strange.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.500]   How can you be God and be with God at the same time?
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   Well, that's why we are who we are.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   In Trinitarian, he is God, and the Son is God, and the Spirit is God, and the Father is God.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   There's one God and three persons. They're with each other, and they're one.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   And then verse 14, Christmas, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   and we have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   Verse 16, "And from His fullness we have all received grace upon grace."
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   So the eternal Word that had no beginning, never came into being,
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   now, in the fullness of time, becomes flesh.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   And in that way, the Son of God becomes flesh.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   The Son of God, Word, same person, becomes flesh,
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   and in becoming flesh, reveals God like He had never been revealed before.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   So here we have God, He was God, clothing Himself with flesh, and the glory of God,
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   the glory as of the only Son from the Father, is being revealed,
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   like that glory had never been revealed before.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   That's John's understanding of Christmas.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   God the Son comes, He is God, He's with God, He reveals God,
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   and now that revelation is dominant by grace, in grace, full of grace and truth.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   "And from His fullness we have all received grace upon grace."
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   So Christmas is the eternal Word, the eternal Son, clothing Himself with flesh,
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   in order that grace might come to sinners, truth might come to sinners.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.500]   Go a little farther, John chapter 3, verse 16.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son," that's Christmas,
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   and Good Friday, all in one, "that whoever believes," this is the purpose for Christmas,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   "that whoever believes in Him might not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.500]   For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world."
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   So Christmas is not for condemnation.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   but that the world through Him might be saved.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   So Christmas is for salvation.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   That's why He came, not to condemn, but to save.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   At the end of the book, near the end of the book, in chapter 18,
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   Jesus is standing before Pilate.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   This is a weighty interchange between Jesus and Pilate.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   Chapter 18, verse 36 and 37, Pilate, "So you are a king?"
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   And Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.500]   For this purpose I was born."
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   So here's Christmas.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   Why were you born?
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   "For this purpose I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world,
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   to bear witness to the truth.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.500]   Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   So another way to say it is that the Son of God, the Word of God,
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   has come into the world, He says here, "to bear witness to the truth."
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   Now what's the effect in Jesus' life and ministry of bearing witness to the truth?
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   In chapter 8, verse 31 and 32, He says very plainly what the effect is.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   He says in John 8, 31, "If you abide in my Word, you are truly my disciples,
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   So the meaning of Christmas is the Son of God comes, and He is the truth.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   I am the way, the truth, and the life, and He speaks the truth.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   I came to bear witness with my person and my words to what is true,
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   what is ultimately real and true, and its effect is freedom, liberty,
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   from the guilt of sin, the power of sin, death, Satan, hell, meaningless life.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   Oh, the liberty that comes into the life of a person who discovers that Jesus is the truth.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500]   See, He was the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   You will know the truth, the truth will set you free.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   Now the question is, how does that happen?
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   How does He do that?
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   How is it that the truth, the spoken truth of God and the personal truth of God in Jesus,
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   set people free from sin and condemnation?
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   And now we're in chapter 6, okay?
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.500]   This is all leading to chapter 6.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   One more sermon on chapter 6.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   You recall, don't you, that in verse 51, we read this, 651,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   "I am the living bread that came down from heaven."
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   That's Christmas.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   "I came down from heaven.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   If anyone eats this bread, me, he will live forever.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.500]   And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.500]   Now link that with chapter 1, verse 14.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.500]   "And the word became flesh."
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   Why?
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.500]   So that verse 51 could happen.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   He came to give His flesh.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.500]   He came to give His flesh for the life of the world.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   He came to have flesh that could be pierced by nails.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   He came to have flesh that could be pierced with a sword and lacerated on His back
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   and a crown of thorns pressed somewhere in the universe, namely on the fleshy head of the Son of God,
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   and cheeks that could be slapped around and beard that could be pulled
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   and eyes that could be spit upon so that the saliva would drip down.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   That's why He came.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   That's why He needed flesh, so that He would have something with which to die,
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   something with which to suffer.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.500]   That's the only way grace can come to sinners.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.500]   And He came full of grace.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.500]   And from His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.500]   And the reason we have received grace upon grace from the fullness of the incarnate Word
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   is that the incarnate Word came to have flesh so that He could die for sinners.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   Had He not died for sinners, we wouldn't have grace.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.500]   We would have only judgment.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:03.500]   And therefore, Christmas is massively and mainly preparation for Good Friday.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   Don't isolate this holiday.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   It's all of a piece with what He came to do.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   So the meaning of Christmas in the Gospel of John is that there was an eternal God
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.500]   in more than one person.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   We know three when we take all the Bible into account--Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:30.500]   The Son, the Word, takes on flesh that He might have flesh with which to die.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.500]   And in giving His flesh for the world, the world can have life because now sins can be forgiven,
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   righteousness can be provided, and a substitute is there.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.500]   And by faith in Him, that is by eating Him, symbolically we consume Him.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   He becomes our treasure, our food, our life.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   His life is now in us.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   Our sins are covered, and we have eternal joy with Him.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   That's moving, very moving.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   All of that is for our eternal joy in God.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   That was from John Piper's sermon preached almost exactly 11 years ago today.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   The sermon is titled, "You Have the Words of Eternal Life," on John 6, verses 60-71.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   You can download the entire message right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   Well, speaking of Christmas, our most asked about Christmas question of all time is about Santa.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   Yes, Santa. No surprise there.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:29.500]   We've addressed Santa in the podcast twice already, back in 2016 and in 2018, in episodes 978 and episode number 1288.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   You can check those out.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   And that episode 978 ends with a mic drop paragraph you don't want to miss. 978, check that out.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   But here's the second most common Christmas question, and it's represented by at least 35 emails in the inbox that I could find.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.500]   The question is over how the church got to celebrating the birth of Christ on December 25th.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:58.500]   Is this because our Christmas Day date emerged from a pagan Germanic holiday, the holiday of Yule or Yule Tide?
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.500]   If that's the case, doesn't the Bible condemn the accommodation of the feasts of the world for the people of God?
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.500]   We actually get this question all the time.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.500]   Maybe Christmas Day is the exact wrong day to address it.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.500]   I don't know. Maybe not.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   I guess it all depends on Pastor John and where his answer goes.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   Wise or not, that's the question.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   Up next time on Friday, I'm Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
