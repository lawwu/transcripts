[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   I would remind you that we are considering at the present time the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.520]   And we began last Friday night with a consideration of certain terms that are used in connection
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.520]   with the work of the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures and with which we had not hitherto dealt.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:35.600]   And the first term that we came to was the baptism with or in or by the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.480]   And I tried to give you, as I understand it, an outline of the biblical teaching with respect
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.800]   to this and then said a few words about the doctrine concerning the filling with the Holy
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.320]   Spirit.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.920]   And I drew a distinction, you may recall, between the two.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.880]   Now I come back again to that subject this evening, and I come back to it for two reasons.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.360]   One is that I am given to understand that there were some at Inneret present who were
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.080]   not quite clear as to what I had been teaching.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.600]   Others, while clear as to what I had said, felt that they would like to hear more about
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.480]   this.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.480]   And for those two main reasons, not to add as a third the all-importance of the subject
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.680]   itself, I come back to it in order to try to give a fuller exposition, and if I can,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.640]   to deal with certain difficulties that have been put to me personally by certain friends.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.880]   Now let me preface my remarks by saying that I am not at all surprised nor disappointed
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   that people have found it difficult to follow this teaching.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.840]   Indeed, I did preface my remarks last week by saying that it was very difficult teaching.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.960]   And it is because of the difficulties that are inherent in this matter that you do have
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.080]   different points of view and different schools of thought.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.680]   We have already found that about other doctrines, so that it does not surprise us.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.200]   Therefore I say that I am in no sense surprised at the consciousness of a certain amount of
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.480]   difficulty.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.160]   If these things could be put simply and plainly, there would never have been any difficulty
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.560]   about them at all.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.040]   And I suppose that in many ways of all the doctrines, this is one that is difficult because
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.360]   it is particularly liable to exaggeration.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.160]   It is a doctrine at which people tend to go off at tangents.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.080]   That was why last week I did put in a little plea that we would try to forget labels.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.960]   I am afraid my plea fell on deaf ears in some cases, and labels were applied.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.520]   But I did make a plea that we should try to forget labels and try to view the statements
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:18.200]   of the Scripture as dispassionately and with as open a mind as we are capable of commending.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.400]   Now I again repeat that plea this evening.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.040]   It is essential for this good cause and for this reason.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.680]   These labels and experiences which we may have had in the past or things that we may
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.760]   have encountered in the past tend to drive us to extremes.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.240]   We are all creatures of extremes.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.320]   The most difficult thing in the world is, as it were, to avoid going either to that
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.760]   extreme or to that extreme.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.400]   It always seems to be easier to be at an extreme, doesn't it?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.000]   It seems clear-cut, as people say, and there you are, you know where you are, you are either
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.680]   here or there.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.160]   But you know, it isn't always right that.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   Only when your extreme has gone beyond the Scripture, or when you've been driven to
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.600]   an extreme in a reaction against another extreme.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   That's the trouble.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.200]   Now with regard to this particular doctrine, we all know that there have been excesses.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.840]   There have been people who have claimed things in terms of this doctrine of the baptism of
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.640]   the Spirit, and we have known on the very surface that what they were claiming as the
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.560]   baptism of the Spirit has sometimes been nothing but animal spirits and sometimes even evil
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.760]   spirits.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.440]   Because accompanying the great claim there has sometimes been a most unworthy life, and
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.640]   there have been things that have been plain contradictions of Scripture, and so on and
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.400]   so forth.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.640]   As I say, this doctrine, because it touches with a subject that is experimental, is particularly
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.160]   liable to that kind of excess, or to that kind of violence.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.720]   And of course, historically, that has happened so many times in the history of the Church.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.440]   The danger then, of course, that arises at once is this.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.480]   In our desire to avoid those excesses and those false claims, we go right over to the
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.680]   other extreme, past the truth which is somewhere there in the middle, and are again at an extreme
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.680]   which is once more non-Scriptural.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.160]   And I feel that this has been happening particularly during this present century.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.800]   There are many Christian people, it seems to me, in their fear of the excesses and the
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.120]   riotous emotionalism that has so often been mistaken for a true work of the Spirit, there
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.280]   are many, I say, who have been guilty of quenching the Spirit.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.040]   Now I think there is a classical way of putting this whole point.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.480]   It all happened, you know, three hundred years ago, in the seventeenth century, in connection
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.520]   with Puritanism.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.540]   Puritanism, which started as one school of thought, divided off into two schools.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.160]   On the one hand, you had George Fox and the Quakers, and on the other hand, you had some
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   of those great Puritan teachers such as Dr. John Owen and Dr. Thomas Goodwin here in London.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.720]   Now there is no doubt, it seems to me, looking back and reading the story in the light of
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.480]   the Scriptures, that they both parties were guilty of going a little bit too far in the
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.640]   right direction.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.040]   George Fox was most certainly calling attention to something vital, but he went too far.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.880]   He almost went to the point of saying that the Scriptures did not matter, that it was
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.960]   this inner light and the Spirit within that mattered alone.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.720]   And the result of that, you see, has been that modern Quakerism, the work of the Society
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.000]   of Friends, is almost entirely non-doctrinal, and indeed at times reaches a point at which
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.400]   you would even query whether it is Christian.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.480]   It is a vague general benevolence and a good spirit.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.440]   But equally, let us admit this, that that other school of thought represented by those
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:21.480]   great men were in constant danger of becoming intellectual only and of developing a kind
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.240]   of new Protestant scholasticism which lost the life and the spirit.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.960]   They were animated, I say, by a fear of the excesses of the Quakers.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.480]   And thus you constantly swing from one extreme to the other.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:44.520]   There, I think, those of you who are interested in biographies may be interested if I make
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.400]   a remark like this.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.280]   The outstanding contribution of the mighty Jonathan Edwards of America, as I see things,
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   was that he combined both schools, that he held on to and insisted upon the doctrinal
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.800]   emphasis of those great Puritan leaders, but also was as alive to the work of the Spirit
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.640]   experimentally as were the Quakers.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.360]   He did not go entirely to one or the other.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:21.760]   He kept both together, and that seems to me to be the teaching of the Holy Scripture itself.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.360]   Now then, let us come back to it in having said that.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:31.220]   Still let us remember that we must not think in terms of slogans or certain things we once
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.460]   knew or certain terms and epithets.
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:45.480]   Let us be careful, I say, lest on the one hand we go to an excess of riot and carnality
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:52.440]   in the name of the Spirit, but let us be equally careful lest we are quenching the Spirit and
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.920]   robbing ourselves of something that God in Christ intends for us.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:02.800]   Very well, bearing that in mind, let us come back and try and place certain definitions
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.040]   before you.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:13.780]   I confess freely to one failure on my part last Friday night, and it was this.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:20.200]   I was frankly speaking on the assumption that you all would be carrying in your minds everything
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.860]   that I had said from January to May.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.620]   I plead guilty to having overestimated you.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:35.380]   And therefore, of course, I can well see how certain people, because they had forgotten
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:41.120]   some of the things that had been said, would be liable to misunderstand what I said last
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.580]   Friday night.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.980]   So let me put it like this.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:53.300]   I was at pains to emphasize that what I was trying to teach was in addition to everything
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.500]   I had said previously about the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.100]   I take all that for granted.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.200]   The work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.980]   I went out of my way to say that this experience is not regeneration.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.500]   I gave you my evidence for that.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:17.620]   I put it to you that surely you must agree that the disciples were regenerate before
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.300]   the day of Pentecost.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.380]   We looked at the evidence pointing in that direction.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.500]   But take further evidence.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.940]   The Apostle Paul says in Romans 8, 9, "If any men have not the Spirit of Christ, he
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.540]   is none of his."
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.320]   You cannot be a Christian at all without having the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.860]   So I was not talking about that.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.060]   I dealt with that probably back last February or March.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.600]   Yes, the Holy Spirit convicts.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.260]   It is he who gives us this new life, brings regeneration to pass, unites us together,
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.260]   unites us to Christ.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.940]   All that is something we have already been trying to deal with.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.540]   So this is not an account of regeneration.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:07.100]   The person I am talking about has already received the Spirit.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   Take again the spiritual men that Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians chapter 2, where he
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.100]   contrasts him with the natural men.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.420]   Again that man obviously has received the Spirit.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.900]   Otherwise he could not understand these things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.780]   He is a Christian.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.100]   Then I did emphasize that verse, didn't I, where Paul says that by one Spirit or in one
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:37.020]   Spirit have we all been baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Greeks.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.860]   But it seems to me that there is one other bit of evidence which is of tremendous importance,
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:48.500]   and it is the statement which is made in the Gospel of John chapter 20 verse 22, where
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.700]   you read this.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.020]   "Our Lord is with the disciples in the upper room.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.740]   Then said Jesus to them again, 'Peace be unto you.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.540]   As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.'
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:13.820]   And when he had said this, he breathed upon them and said unto them, 'Receive ye the
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.820]   Holy Ghost.'"
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.820]   Now that, remember, was in the upper room.
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:25.140]   He breathed upon them and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.140]   But going on to Acts 1 and 4, I read this.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.780]   "And being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.300]   from Jerusalem.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:42.260]   But wait, saith he, for the promise of the Father, which ye have heard of me.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:49.700]   For John truly baptized with water, but he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.860]   many days hence."
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.860]   Now he says that to them, you see, after he has breathed upon them and has said to them,
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.060]   "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.680]   So I say it isn't the receiving of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.300]   It isn't regeneration.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.900]   It isn't the receiving of the Holy Ghost.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.820]   Here are men who are regenerate and have received the Holy Ghost as Christ breathed upon them
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.900]   and still he says to them, "You shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.900]   hence."
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.460]   And it happened ten days later.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.840]   Very well then, that's the first point.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.200]   So I trust now that all are perfectly clear about this.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:37.080]   I am not saying, and I didn't say once and have never said that without this particular
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.680]   experience that I'm dealing with now that you're not a Christian.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.480]   I say you can be a Christian.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.840]   These disciples were Christians and others have been Christians.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.040]   So it isn't that.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.760]   Let me make this equally plain also.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.640]   I am not saying, and it's no part of my understanding of this doctrine to say that there must however
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.400]   be a gap always between becoming a Christian and this.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.720]   They may happen together and have often done so, but sometimes they don't.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.400]   So let's keep it distinct.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.960]   Now then my second statement is that I am not dealing also with sanctification.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.720]   We spent four Friday nights in May dealing with the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.960]   So I innocently assumed last Friday evening that it would be clear to everybody that I
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.920]   was not dealing with sanctification last Friday night because I've already done so.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:39.060]   But let me say this, it's vitally important that we shouldn't confuse these two things.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:46.120]   As I understand the situation, nothing has done greater damage during the last seventy
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:56.480]   years as the confusion that has been so constant between sanctification and this experience
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.080]   of the baptism of the Spirit with which we are dealing.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.840]   I think it has been prolific of misunderstanding.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:09.200]   And people have talked, you see, about receiving their sanctification in one experience.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.720]   They have regarded sanctification as an experience to start with, which seems to me to be entirely
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.840]   wrong, and it's always been due to the fact that they have confused sanctification with
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   this.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.880]   Sanctification, as we've seen so many times, is a process that begins the moment we are
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.880]   regenerate.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.400]   It begins indeed the moment we are justified.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:37.920]   You cannot be justified without the process of sanctification having already started.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.000]   We saw it still more plainly in doing the doctrine of the union of the believer with
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.560]   Christ.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   If you are joined to Christ, if you are in Christ, well then all the benefits of Christ
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:57.480]   are yours, and this process of sanctification begins the moment our justification begins.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.200]   Sanctification is not an experience.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.360]   So we must sharply differentiate between these things.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:11.000]   Whereas this thing to which I am calling attention is essentially an experience.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.640]   This is help sanctification, but they are not an essential part of it.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:22.160]   They promote sanctification, but sanctification itself, I say, is not an experience.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.280]   So I am not talking about any so-called second blessing in terms of sanctification or anything
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.280]   like that.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:35.160]   It has, in a sense, nothing to do with sanctification except indirectly.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.880]   And in the same way, I must point out again that this experience is not identical and
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.760]   must not be identified with the filling of the Spirit.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.720]   And that I say for this reason, that according to the teaching of the Apostle, you remember
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:56.920]   in Ephesians 4, verse 18, we should always be filled with the Spirit.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.360]   Be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit, which means
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.480]   go on being filled with the Spirit.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.860]   Keep on being filled with the Spirit.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.400]   We should always be filled with the Spirit.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.200]   But what I am trying to talk about here and to describe is not a perpetual condition.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:22.560]   It is something much more unique than that, something much more special.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.680]   And in the same way, we saw last Friday that the filling with the Spirit so often happens
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:34.440]   for a special service, for some special task which is allotted to the children of God.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.900]   Well very well then, having made those negative statements in order to clear the position
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:44.700]   on the ground, you may well ask me, "Well, what is this then of which you are speaking?"
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.080]   Well my reply would be this.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.700]   It is precisely what our Lord was speaking about in John 14, and especially in John 14,
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.440]   verse 21.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.120]   He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.280]   That seems to me to be the key verse.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:20.160]   I am talking about this spiritual manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ to his own.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.040]   He doesn't do it to the world, to his own.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:29.080]   It is the spiritual manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.560]   It is something beyond assurance.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:37.640]   Now we've dealt with assurance months ago, so it isn't assurance.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.280]   I'm presupposing assurance.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.880]   I am suggesting that a man may be a believer and regenerate and have assurance of salvation,
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:55.680]   and still he has not known this spiritual manifestation of Christ to himself.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.080]   Now that is perhaps the simplest and the clearest way in which I can put it.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.480]   But it occurred to me that perhaps it might be of some help if I gave you some of the
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:16.060]   great classical examples of this great and remarkable experience which the Lord there
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.840]   promises in John 14, verse 21.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.800]   Now let me give you some instances.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:31.400]   I wonder whether you've heard, for instance, about a Puritan of the name of John Flavel.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.320]   Some of you have heard of him.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.520]   He wasn't one of the so-called greatest Puritans.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:44.760]   He was rather a quiet man, a man who was used of God in a small sphere in a very striking
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.640]   way.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.360]   But this is something that happened to John Flavel.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   Let me read it to you.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:00.000]   John Flavel was alone on a journey, his mind greatly occupied with self-examination and
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.240]   prayer, and thus describes what befell him.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.520]   In all that day's journey he neither met, overtook, nor was overtaken by any.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.960]   Thus going on his way, his thoughts began to swell and rise higher and higher like the
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:26.640]   waters in Ezekiel's vision, till at last they became an overwhelming flood.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:33.360]   Such was the intention of his mind, such the ravishing tastes of heavenly joys, and such
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.720]   the full assurance of his interest therein, that he utterly lost all sight and sense of
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.640]   this world and all the concerns thereof.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   And for some hours he knew no more where he was than if he had been in a deep sleep upon
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.920]   his bed.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.200]   Arriving in great exhaustion at a certain spring, he sat down and washed, earnestly
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.960]   desiring if it was God's pleasure that this might be his parting place from this world.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.600]   Death had the most amiable face in his eye that ever he beheld, except the face of Jesus
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.920]   Christ which made it so.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.080]   And he does not remember, though he believed himself dying, that he ever thought of his
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.000]   dear wife or children or any earthly concernment.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.600]   Upon reaching his inn, the influence still continued, banishing sleep.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   Still the joy of the Lord overflowed him, and he seemed to be an inhabitant of the other
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   world.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.720]   But within a few hours he was sensible of the ebbing of the tide, and before night,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.360]   though there was a heavenly serenity and sweet peace upon his spirit, which continued long
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:44.880]   with him, yet the transports of joy were over, and the fine edge of his delight blunted.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.640]   He many years after called that day "one of the days of heaven," and professed he
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:57.160]   understood more of the life of heaven by it than by all the books he ever read or discourses
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.920]   he ever entertained about it.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.640]   That is it.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.360]   But let me give you another example.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.800]   Let us go from John Fleville to Jonathan Edwards.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:19.720]   Now Jonathan Edwards, as you know, was probably one of the greatest minds, I say it very advisedly,
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.800]   that the world has ever known.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:27.080]   He is certainly the greatest brain America has ever produced, a brilliant, outstanding
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:34.240]   philosopher, the last man in the world to be carried away by false emotionalism.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.960]   Indeed he wrote a great treatise on the subject called, you remember, "On the Religious
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.240]   Affections," to teach people how to differentiate between the work of the spirit and the carnality
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.240]   that often simulates the work of the spirit.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.280]   So Jonathan Edwards is the last man who is likely to go astray at this point.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.600]   Listen to what he says.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.440]   As I rode out into the woods for my health in 1737, having alighted from my horse in
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:09.360]   a retired place, as my manner commonly has been, to walk for divine contemplation and
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:19.200]   prayer, I had a view that was for me extraordinary of the glory of the Son of God as mediator
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:27.240]   between God and men, and his wonderful, great, full, pure, and sweet grace and love, and
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.160]   meek and gentle condescension.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.120]   The grace that appeared so calm and sweet appeared also great above the heavens.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.600]   The person of Christ appeared ineffably excellent, and an excellency great enough to swallow
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:46.760]   up all thoughts and conceptions, which continued as near as I can judge about an hour, which
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.640]   kept me a greater part of the time in a flood of tears and weeping aloud.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   I felt an ardency of soul to be what I know not otherwise how to express, emptied and
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:06.520]   annihilated, to lie in the dust and to be full of Christ alone, to love him with a holy
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:12.920]   and pure love, to trust in him, to live upon him, to serve him, and to be perfectly sanctified
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.280]   and made pure with a divine and heavenly purity.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.840]   That is Jonathan Edwards.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.160]   Then coming from Jonathan Edwards we come to a very different man, D.L.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:30.760]   Moody, who was not a great brain, not a great philosopher, not a genius in any sense of
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.760]   the term.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.400]   He always described himself as a very ordinary man, and he was a very ordinary man.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.280]   But you see, he gets exactly the same thing.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.480]   Listen, "I can myself," he says, "go back almost twelve years."
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.320]   Now wait a minute, that is not the one I think.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   Yes, it is.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.560]   "I can myself go back almost twelve years and remember two holy women who used to come
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.360]   to my meetings.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.760]   It was delightful to see them there, for when I began to preach, I could tell by the expression
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.400]   of their faces that they were praying for me.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.040]   At the close of the Sabbath services they would say to me, 'We have been praying for
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   you.'
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.920]   I said, 'Why don't you pray for the people?'
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.120]   They answered, 'You need power.'
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.000]   'I need power,' I said to myself.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.240]   Why, I thought I had power.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.520]   I had a large Sabbath school and the largest congregation in Chicago.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.720]   There were some conversions at the time, and I was in a sense satisfied.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.240]   But right along, the two godly women kept praying for me, and their earnest talk about
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   the anointing for special service set me thinking.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.840]   I asked them to come and talk with me, and we got down on our knees.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.000]   They poured out their hearts that I might receive the anointing of the Holy Ghost, and
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.040]   there came a great hunger into my soul.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.920]   I knew not what it was.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.040]   I began to cry as never before.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.640]   The hunger increased.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.880]   I rarely felt that I did not want to live any longer if I could not have this power
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.080]   for service.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.360]   I kept on crying all the time that God would fill me with His Spirit.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.840]   Well, one day in the city of New York—oh, what a day!
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.680]   I cannot describe it.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.060]   I seldom refer to it.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.520]   It is almost too sacred an experience to name.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.240]   Paul had an experience of which he never spoke for fourteen years.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.240]   I can only say, "God revealed Himself to me."
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.080]   And I had such an experience of His love that I had to ask Him to stay His hand.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.680]   I went to preaching again.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.440]   The sermons were not different, and I did not present any new truths, and yet hundreds
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.660]   were converted.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:41.680]   I would not be placed back where I was before that blessed experience if He would give me
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   all Glasgow.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.480]   He had said that in Glasgow.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.520]   "Well, I see that I must not keep you.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.780]   My time is going.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.800]   I had intended to read you a similar thing to the great Baptist preacher, Christmas Evans."
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.520]   Same thing exactly.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   It happened to Wesley.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.120]   It happened to Whitefield.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.920]   But you may say, "All those men were great preachers, and evidently it is something that
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.560]   is intended for men who are to perform striking service."
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.360]   I have told you that in the case of John Fleville that was not the case.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.640]   And there are others, large numbers of ordinary people, who can testify to exactly the same
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.480]   thing.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.920]   And indeed we are told specifically in the Scriptures, are we not, that this is something
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.980]   which all Christians should experience.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.560]   You remember what the Apostle Peter said on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.640]   The men cried out and said, "What shall we do?"
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.160]   And Peter said, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.840]   for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:48.760]   For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off, as many as the
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.000]   Lord our God shall call."
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.040]   There, it seems to me, is the statement which means that it is something which is meant
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.520]   to be quite universal amongst Christian people.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.000]   Well, what is this?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.760]   Well, as I say, I can't identify this with being filled with the Spirit, because these
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:13.800]   men who look back to this one great occasion were filled with the Spirit many times afterwards.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.360]   Well, what is it?
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.000]   Well, in a sense I describe it like this.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.760]   It is the initial experience of that.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.880]   Or perhaps we can put it like this.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.800]   It is an exceptionally outstanding experience of that.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.240]   It is something they describe as being poured forth, the very terms of Scripture.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:43.280]   Phineas says in his case it came wave after wave upon him, a pouring out, something unusual,
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.520]   something I say in which all these men say that they seem to be almost lifted up to the
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.640]   heavens.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.040]   They knew what it was to be filled many times afterwards.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   But this was something unique and special.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.760]   It is an occasion in which the reality of divine things becomes plain in a way that
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:07.800]   they've never been before and in a sense never are again, so that they can look back to it.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.240]   It stands out in all its glory.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:18.040]   And therefore I suggest to you that this is something which we should seek.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:23.120]   And I am suggesting again that so many, because of their fear of the excesses, have never
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.760]   even sought it and have felt that it's wrong to seek it and dangerous to seek it, and thereby
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:34.160]   put themselves out of the category that includes these great men of God whose experiences I've
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   just been reading to you.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.360]   Now I say that this is something which is to be sought.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.000]   And let me add this.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.040]   It is not something which, according to the current phrase, you believe that you have
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.080]   received by faith.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.720]   Now you're familiar with that teaching, aren't you?
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.000]   They say, "Ah yes, you go to the scripture, you read it, you believe it, yes, well very
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.040]   well you ask God for it, then you accept it by faith and you believe that you've had it."
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.920]   They say, "Don't worry about your feelings.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.600]   Don't worry about your feelings at all."
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:13.120]   You take it by faith and believe you've got it, you know the teaching.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.720]   Now that seems to me to be a complete denial of this teaching.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.880]   When this happens, you don't have to persuade yourself that you've received it, you know
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.320]   that you've received it.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   My friends, when God sheds abroad his love in your heart by the Holy Spirit, you don't
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.040]   have to say, "Yes, I've received it by faith."
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.600]   Love is always love.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.040]   And when you love a person, you don't have to persuade yourself that you love the person,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.400]   you know that you love the person, your feelings are engaged.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.840]   And I say when God sheds his love abroad in your heart, you feel it and you know it and
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.680]   like these men, you say, "God was pouring it into me and I knew it was there and my
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:00.160]   heart went out in love to him."
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.240]   Don't you begin to agree with me when I say that this has been something which has been
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.800]   missing in spiritual experience in the last 50 years?
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.560]   This teaching which says, "Take it on faith, don't worry about your feelings."
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:17.400]   But my dear friends, if you do love the Lord your God, you can't help knowing it.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.040]   If you say that though you haven't seen him, that you love him, "In whom though now we
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:28.440]   see him not yet believing, we rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory," feeling
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.420]   is engaged at that point.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:41.080]   But you see, we've been so afraid of emotionalism that we've cut out emotion.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   And people today don't seem to know what it is to have a sense of sin and sorrow for sin.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.200]   There are people today who are Christians who never wept because of their sinfulness.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.280]   They say, "Of course, I don't believe in emotion.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.640]   There mustn't be any emotion.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.120]   It's marvelous there's no emotion."
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.420]   But my friends, there must be emotion.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.120]   If you've seen the plague of your heart and know what sin is, you will feel it and you'll
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:08.300]   bemoan it and you'll weep like a Jonathan Edwards and like all the saints.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:13.400]   And your love for Christ will not be something that you just say lightly and glibly.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.680]   Your heart will be moved.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.440]   Your feelings will be engaged.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.240]   A profound emotion will sweep through your being.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.640]   It happened to the Apostle Paul.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.840]   It's happened to these people in the New Testament.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.600]   It's happened to these men whose experiences I've read, and I say they are but representative
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.760]   of thousands of others.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.240]   Do we know something about this?
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.400]   This is a lecture on biblical doctrine.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.640]   And some people seem to think that that means it's as dry as dust.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.800]   It's preaching, my friend.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.440]   I'm simply here to ask you, and that's why I've come back to this subject, do you know
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.500]   anything about the reality of Christ?
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.040]   And have you felt your heart going out to him in love that you can't understand and
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.760]   that has amazed you?
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:07.120]   I say that as Christian people, we have no right to stop at anything less than that.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.680]   If we really knew him, we'd love him like this.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.120]   Has he manifested himself to you?
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:26.000]   Oh, again, let me say, beware of the counterfeit.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.960]   Beware lest Satan come in and as you seek this, might try to pass to you something that
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.040]   is not the true experience.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.560]   Well, how do we know that?
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.040]   Well, here's the final test always.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.840]   Seek not an experience, but seek him.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.280]   Seek to know him.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.560]   Seek to realize his presence.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.440]   Seek to love him.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.680]   Seek to die to yourself and everything else that you may live entirely in him and for
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.640]   him and give yourself entirely to him.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.920]   If he is at the center, you'll be safe.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.400]   But if you are simply seeking an experience, if you are simply seeking for thrills, if
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.120]   you are simply seeking for excitement, well then, you are opening the door to the counterfeit
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.240]   and probably you will receive it.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.200]   Shall I try to help you at that point by reading you something else?
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.040]   Listen to this, which will help us at just that particular point.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:35.120]   Here is a man writing, who again had had this very experience, and he writes to us and he
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:44.000]   says, "You, entertaining a certain conception of the Spirit, ask for the Spirit and suppose
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.840]   that his influences will all correspond with the conception that you have formed.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:58.520]   You expect him, for instance, to be to you a spirit of consolation and compass you about
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.840]   with the ambrosial airs of paradise.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   You understand that he is to lift you up into a super mundane ethereal sphere where poetic
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   visions of the islands of the blessed shall come flashing upon you, upon the right hand
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.520]   and upon the left.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:26.080]   But the Spirit is truth and he must come in his own true character or not at all.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.640]   You have solicited his ministrations and they are not withheld.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:37.680]   But how surprised you are when he takes you by the hand and you prepare for a rapturous
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:44.300]   ascent into the Empyrean to find that he has taken you by the hand for the purpose of conducting
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:50.880]   you down into some deep, dark, dungeon-like chambers of imagery.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.680]   In vain you shudder and draw back.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.360]   You only discover thereby what an iron grasp he has.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:04.640]   He bids you look upon those hideous images and observe how they body forth the great
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.100]   features of your past life.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:15.400]   One abominable statue is named Selfishness and its lofty pedestal is completely carved
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.900]   with inscriptions of dates.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.380]   You look at those dates.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:25.380]   Your guide constrains you to and you are appalled to find that what you regarded as the most
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:35.120]   beautiful and consecrated hours of your past life are there, even there.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:43.100]   There is a repulsive image also called Covetousness and you say boldly, "Sure, I am that no
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.300]   date of mine is inscribed there."
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:53.980]   Alas, there are many and some that you thought golden, connecting you with heaven.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:37:02.240]   Anger, wrath, malice, see how the odious monsters seem to wink at you from their seats as at
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.520]   a well-known comrade.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.820]   How the picture of your past life is made ugly on their pedestals.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:14.140]   You look unbelief in the face and frowning tell him that you know him not.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.660]   Whatever your faults, you have never been an unbeliever.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.180]   The spirit constrains you to observe that unbelief claims and justly claims the whole
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.220]   of your past life.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:30.140]   A profound humiliation and a piercing sorrow possess your heart.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:35.520]   At least you say standing opposite the image of falsehood, "I am no liar.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.820]   I hate all falsehood with a perfect hatred."
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.020]   The spirit of God points you to the fatal evidence.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:49.620]   You examine the dates and you see that some of them refer even to your seasons of prayer.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:58.380]   At length, altogether humbled, dispirited, and conscience stricken, you acknowledge that
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:05.100]   here in these damp subterranean galleries and in the midst of these abominable images
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.780]   is your true home.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:13.860]   You remember with shame the ideas with which you had greeted the spirit and you fall at
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.500]   his feet confessing all your folly.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:26.280]   There, in that condition, does he raise you and lead you out into the open air beneath
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:33.020]   the blessed canopy of heaven and you find a chariot in which you may, unforbidden, take
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:40.820]   your place beside the spirit and visit the places of joy that are above the earth.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.500]   There it is.
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.620]   The work of the spirit is always humbling and humiliating.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.620]   It brings us to the end of self.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.340]   It reveals sin to us.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.620]   You see, we want to have the power of the spirit as we are and the great experiences,
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.220]   but we shan't have them that way.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:02.860]   We've got to submit entirely to him and he takes us through those galleries first.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:10.680]   When we feel utterly hopeless, he then, as we are told here, provides this amazing chariot
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:18.420]   for us which takes us to the very heavens and gives us this glorious experience of the
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:25.060]   reality of the Son of God, the manifestation of Christ according to his promise, which
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.180]   moves us and grips us to the depths of our being.
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:35.580]   And we are lost in a sense of wonder, love, and praise.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:41.100]   I had also a quotation from the saintly John Fletcher of Madeleine, which more or less
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:47.540]   says exactly the same thing, in warning to Christian people not to think that they can
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:53.220]   have this uplifting experience just when they think, and likewise not to think it's just
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.460]   to be accepted by faith and to believe that you've got it.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.820]   It is given in God's way and it is given, and when it is given it's known and it's
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.820]   unmistakable.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:10.420]   And the saint, the person who's received it, can proceed to testify to it.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.860]   Well, very well, God willing, we shall go on from there to what seems to me to follow
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:22.740]   logically from it, which is the sealing of the spirit and the earnest of the spirit and
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:30.700]   certain teaching in the scripture which tells us how these things are to be sought and,
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.140]   thank God, how they are to be obtained.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.140]   Let us pray.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:43.140]   Oh Lord, our God, we thank thee at the end as we did at the beginning for the riches
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.540]   of thy grace.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:51.020]   Oh God, forgive us if in our ignorance we have been guilty of quenching thy spirit or
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:56.020]   putting our little limits upon thy wondrous grace.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:03.300]   Oh God, give us honesty, we pray thee, in thy presence to examine ourselves, to examine
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:11.380]   our own hearts, to know whether we do know thee and whether we really do love thee and
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:16.500]   whether we have ever had this spiritual manifestation of thy Son.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:25.660]   Oh God, forgive us for being so content with a low level and deal with us, we pray thee,
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.940]   in thy love and mercy.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:35.940]   We humble ourselves before thee and we would say simply, have thine own way with us, oh
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:44.540]   Lord, but shed thy love abroad in our hearts and grant us to know thee, truly the only
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.740]   true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:55.300]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:01.460]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now, throughout the remainder
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:11.580]   of this, our earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see him face to face and
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:16.180]   rejoice in him forever and forever.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.340]   Amen.
