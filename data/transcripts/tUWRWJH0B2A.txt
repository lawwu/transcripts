[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Good Monday morning.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.600]   Hope you had a great weekend
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.480]   and I hope you have a wonderful week ahead.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.560]   Well, we've talked briefly about lament on the podcast,
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.240]   particularly about whether or not we can get angry with God.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.400]   We address that back in APJ 931,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.180]   930 was a long time ago, episode 931.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.960]   Since that episode aired,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.400]   which is an episode that compares godly lament
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.520]   with ungodly lament,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.240]   several more questions and follow up questions
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.680]   have come in on this topic.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.280]   Here's one example, Pastor John,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.240]   a most recent version from a listener named Brian.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.880]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.960]   I'm wondering if we can be honestly angry at God
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.680]   for things that happen to our lives
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.560]   or is such a response out of the question?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.240]   Pastor John, what would you say to Brian?
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.400]   - Let me try to interpret Brian's question
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400]   so that I can try to answer what I think he's really asking.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.480]   He says, can we be honestly angry at God?
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.080]   Now I'm not sure what he means by honestly,
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   because I don't know what a dishonest anger at God would be.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.280]   I think he means by honestly angry, really angry,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.260]   truly angry.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.880]   The other word that I wonder about
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.760]   is the word can.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.320]   Can we be truly angry with God?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.580]   I think he means, should we be?
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.580]   Or is it morally permissible or right to be?
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.960]   And when he asks, is it out of the question?
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.120]   I think he means, is it so wrong
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.040]   that we should avoid it at all costs?
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.200]   So the question I'll try to answer is this,
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   is it ever virtuous or righteous or godly
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.360]   or innocent or even morally neutral
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.080]   to experience, to feel,
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.160]   not talking about what you say,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.680]   I'm talking about what you feel,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.280]   to feel heartfelt anger at God,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.620]   whatever the reason, whatever the reason.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.840]   That's my question.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.720]   And the short answer is no, never.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.240]   It is never right, never good, never virtuous,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   never merely neutral to feel anger at God, never.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.680]   Now, Paul imagines a situation
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.840]   where a man sees God as something he doesn't like,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.960]   isn't approved of the way God's acting,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.240]   and he expresses this, this man,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.400]   this person that Paul's thinking about,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.640]   expresses this in very forceful terms
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.040]   of resistance to God's ways.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.480]   It's described in Romans 9, 18 to 20 like this,
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.680]   God has mercy on whomever he wills, Paul says,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.440]   and he hardens whomever he wills.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.080]   You will say to me then, why does he still find fault?
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.400]   My tone of voice there is an interpretation,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.280]   and you'll see, I think it's a legitimate interpretation
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.120]   as we keep moving.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.660]   Why does he still find fault?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.700]   For who can resist his will?
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.800]   Who are you, oh man, Paul says,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   who are you, oh man, to answer back to God?
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   Will what is molded say to its molder,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.280]   why have you made me like this?
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.720]   So here's a situation where a human being
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   watches God's action and does not like what he sees.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   And Paul doesn't say it makes him angry,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.880]   he says that it makes him question God,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.320]   who can resist your will?
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.760]   Why do you still find fault?
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.480]   Why have you made me like this?
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.320]   And Paul responds to this kind of questioning of God
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   with who do you think you are, oh man,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   oh man, to get in God's face about the way he acts,
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.640]   that's a pretty strong rebuke.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.600]   So if Paul says that the mere words
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.480]   of questioning God are so out of place,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.840]   what would he say if those questioning words
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.340]   were enforced with strong emotion
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.760]   and anger?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.520]   He would say they're doubly out of place.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.120]   It's not right for a creature to call into question
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.520]   his maker and doubly wrong for a creature
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   to back that up with the force of an emotional no to God.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.080]   Now, don't confuse this with humbly trying
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.320]   to understand the perplexing ways of the one you trust.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.840]   Oh my goodness, that's worth a lifetime, right?
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.040]   That's all I do.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.480]   It's like, at least I try to be humble and say,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.240]   God, I want to understand.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.600]   I want to understand as much as you reveal in your word,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.880]   grant me eyes to see.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.880]   It's not wrong to ask God questions like Mary.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.900]   When the Lord said to her, you're gonna have a baby, Mary,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.300]   while you're a virgin, and Mary bows and said,
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.020]   I'm your handmaid, but how can this be?
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.300]   God did not get upset with that question.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.100]   That was a good question, a how question.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.680]   A humble longing to understand is not a bad thing,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.300]   but it's always wrong to question God
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.580]   as though he were in the wrong.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.380]   As I've thought now about why Christians
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.660]   who believe the Bible might think otherwise,
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.620]   and evidently they do, I've tried to get inside their heads
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.500]   and see some possible ways that they're thinking.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.860]   So let me respond to a few of those.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.860]   One, maybe some people think that since anger
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.060]   is not a decision of the will,
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.300]   but rather an emotion that rises spontaneously
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.300]   out of the heart, maybe it doesn't have the same rightness
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.540]   or wrongness that a decision of the will would have, maybe.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.700]   But that's not what the Bible teaches about emotions.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.520]   Emotions are not morally neutral.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.100]   Many emotions are forbidden by God,
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.100]   and other emotions are commanded by God.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.340]   We're told not to fear, not to be anxious.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.500]   We're told to put away bitterness.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.780]   We're told to abstain from desires of the flesh.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.540]   We're told to love God and delight in God
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.060]   and find pleasure in God's presence and praise God
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.880]   and be thankful to God and rejoice in all his works.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.380]   So it's simply not true
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.700]   that even though emotions rise spontaneously,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.620]   that they are morally neutral.
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.380]   They're not morally neutral.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.100]   They are morally significant.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.740]   A good tree bears good fruit, a bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.120]   Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.980]   and out of the abundance of the heart, the emotions flow.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.460]   So whether anger at God is right or wrong
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.740]   cannot be settled simply by saying it's an emotion.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:59.100]   Second, I wonder if people who think that anger with God
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.060]   is morally good or neutral
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.460]   are confusing the approval of anger
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.480]   with the approval of honesty and authenticity.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:18.020]   In other words, I wonder if in refusing to disapprove
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:24.260]   of anger at God, what they are really disapproving of
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.260]   is hypocrisy, of feeling anger and not expressing it.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.780]   I wonder if they really do assume
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.900]   lots of people are angry at God,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.900]   and people like Piper are cultivating class A hypocrites
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.460]   by telling people it's wrong to express it.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.980]   So maybe some of the people who say it's okay
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.100]   to be angry at God are really on a crusade
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.020]   to help people who are angry at God be honest
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.300]   and say they are.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.940]   Now, my take on this is that if you are angry with God,
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:14.980]   there is absolutely no point in hiding it from him.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.820]   You can't.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.460]   You may as well tell him that you're angry.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.940]   The telling is not the problem.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.580]   I'm not on a crusade to shut people's mouths.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.780]   I'm on a crusade to change people's hearts.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.780]   The feeling of the anger is the problem, not the mouth.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.860]   So don't add sin to sin.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.440]   Don't add the sin of hypocrisy to the sin of anger.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.580]   The battle is not with your mouth.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.780]   It's with your heart.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:56.660]   Third, I wonder if since it's possible to be angry
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.860]   at someone that we love, love very much, spouse, child,
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:09.580]   God, it's possible to be angry with someone that we love,
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.700]   it seems to some people that therefore
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.180]   we can be angry with God while still loving him,
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.060]   and it must not then be bad.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.260]   But that doesn't follow, does it?
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.020]   It may still be a sin to be angry with God
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.780]   even though we love him,
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.980]   because anger towards God is not what flows
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.800]   from loving God.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:40.500]   Four, I wonder if some pastorally sensitive people,
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.820]   I think this one probably is very prominent.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.500]   I wonder if some pastorally sensitive people are
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   very reluctant to disapprove of anger at God
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.940]   because they know that if they do,
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.860]   they may be heaping guilt on people
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.860]   who are already experiencing the pain of a huge loss,
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:11.400]   which has made them angry at God in the first place.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.940]   Now, in my experience of dealing with hundreds of people
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.540]   in times of great loss over the last 50 years,
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:28.100]   God in his wisdom has always provided a way
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:34.540]   to minister to people's true need and true pain
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.100]   without compromising the truth.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.820]   It is a pastoral failure of nerve or failure of wisdom
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:53.780]   if we think that we have to condone sin
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.900]   in order to bring comfort.
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.340]   There's always a better way.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:05.640]   And finally, number five, I wonder if people who approve
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.620]   of anger at God have really thought through
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.000]   what anger at a person is.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.340]   It is a strong, emotionally laden disapproval.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:28.020]   That's what anger is, a strong, emotional disapproval.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:36.020]   God does something, we assess it, we disapprove of it,
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.880]   we oppose it emotionally, we resist.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.620]   Anger is the counterpart in the heart
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.820]   to the indictment of God in the head.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.900]   Our minds judge God to be in the wrong
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.000]   and our emotions say this with anger.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.500]   And my response is that God always acts justly.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.820]   He always acts wisely.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.780]   He always acts with love toward his people.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.140]   He never wrongs anyone.
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.580]   He is never blameworthy.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.580]   He is always pure and holy and righteous and good.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:29.180]   He is infinitely worthy of our trust and our love
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.240]   and our admiration and our delight.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   And when we don't understand his ways,
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.400]   we put our hands on our mouths and kiss the rod
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:48.240]   and say with Paul, "Oh, the depth of the riches
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.320]   "and the wisdom and the knowledge of God."
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.840]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.600]   And Brian, thank you for the question.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.360]   If you wanna find that other episode
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.080]   on Godly Lament, see APJ 931,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.720]   an episode actually on prayer,
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.680]   I think was the topic.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.000]   It was titled, "How Do You Pray in Public Without Performing?"
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.300]   And there's a little riff on lament in there
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.000]   that's worth listening to as well.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.200]   Thank you for joining us today.
