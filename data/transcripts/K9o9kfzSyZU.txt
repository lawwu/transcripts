[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.200]   All right.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.320]   We have a question here from Raquel.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.280]   Sorry, Raquel.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.640]   Raquel asks, do you carry or keep
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.320]   two analog pieces on your desk, one being your time block
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.840]   planner and another for notes or just your planner?
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.800]   So Raquel, my two always around, processed
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.880]   during every shutdown ritual, every day capture tools
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.320]   is my time block planner, which has for every day space
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.360]   for notes and tasks that I can write down.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.980]   And that's where my checkbox is that I
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.000]   have to check when I do my shutdown routine
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.840]   at the end of each day.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.640]   So I know that's all going to be processed.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.960]   The second tool I always have is my working memory.txt plain text
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.440]   file on my computer desktop.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.040]   I want to say on my computer desktop,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.160]   I have multiple computers.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.760]   They each have one.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.440]   But my main computer I use on a normal workday
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.320]   would be my laptop.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.440]   And I have it right there.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.880]   So I always have my paper notebook.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.480]   I can capture things on it, especially
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.400]   if I'm away from my computer.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.080]   And then I have that working memory.txt,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.600]   which collects a lot of information during the day,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.800]   especially when I'm doing stuff on my computer
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.280]   and a lot of information pops up.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.440]   Imagine, for example, you're in a Zoom meeting.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.040]   And there's some notes you have to think about and six tasks
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.860]   that come out of that meeting.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.680]   I'm just typing that right into my working memory.txt
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.800]   right there on my computer.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.560]   I can type much faster than I can write.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.120]   I can put voluminous notes into there.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.840]   Don't overthink it.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.880]   Don't make it too pretty.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.280]   Just boom, boom, boom.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.760]   End of the day when I do my shutdown routine,
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.320]   I look at the time block planner, what's in there.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.160]   Everything get put into my permanent systems.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.160]   I look at working memory.txt.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.440]   Let's take care of everything that's in there.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   So that's the regular things I use.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280]   I then will introduce project-specific analog
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280]   notebooks.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.720]   So if I'm working on a particular computer science
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.960]   research paper, I might have a grid notebook.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.360]   I like grid-line notebooks for doing mathematics
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.640]   that I'm just bringing with me to work on that project.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.120]   If I'm working on a new book, I might
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.000]   get a Moleskine notebook dedicated to that book,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.240]   just to put ideas in there as I have them,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.120]   collect inspiration when I'm away from a computer, et cetera.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.880]   And those I will use and process in a way that
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   is bespoke to their corresponding project.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.760]   So when it comes time to work on that academic paper again,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.440]   hey, here's my notebook for that particular paper.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.960]   Let me see what I had in there.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.320]   And that's where I'm storing it.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.000]   So I have two permanent collection mechanisms,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.880]   one analog, one digital.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.040]   And then I will, when useful, have
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   these project-specific notebooks.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.080]   What about the pocket-sized Moleskine
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.720]   that you carry around?
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.840]   Yeah, OK, so that--
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.760]   it's a good question.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.440]   So I also have a pocket-sized Moleskine
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.080]   that I use basically for reflections on the deep life.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.580]   Now, I didn't have that terminology
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.920]   when I first started using this.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.480]   I first started this method in 2004.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.360]   And I used to post pictures on my newsletter
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.440]   of the growing stack of the old Moleskines.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.840]   And so that's not--
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.400]   the reason why I didn't mention it here
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000]   is that that's not work-related.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.600]   But Justin, I'm glad you brought it up, because it's important.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.920]   When I have reflections about my life,
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.520]   intimations about this thing I just saw or read resonated,
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.200]   reflections--
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.600]   this has been a tough two weeks.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.840]   Why?
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.560]   What's going on here?
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.640]   What can I learn about what's making me miserable
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.160]   and I might want to avoid?
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.640]   Ideas about what if we rethought this part of our working life?
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.360]   What if in my constitution bucket
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.640]   I rethought how exercise was in my life?
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.000]   So everything related to living the deep life.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   When I have ideas, inspirations, and reflections,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.760]   I carry with me also in my bag an old school pocket-sized
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.080]   Moleskine.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.360]   Why that particular notebook?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.560]   It's because it's what I bought at the MIT co-op the first week
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.680]   I was on campus at MIT as a grad student.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.880]   And that's when I started this habit.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.080]   So for me, it is the comfort of that's what I've always used.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.840]   You can use whatever notebook you want.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.960]   That I look at when I'm doing updates to my semester
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.640]   quarterly plan.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.760]   So there, if I'm thinking through, OK, guys,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.600]   let's check in.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.800]   What are we working on for the next semester?
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.720]   That's where-- because when you work on those,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.440]   you look at your values and you typically
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.520]   have a vision at the top of each of these documents
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.880]   about where you want to be.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.400]   Great time to look at those Moleskines.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.860]   The only other tip I'll give you about that Moleskine method
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.560]   is what do you do when you fill it?
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.720]   My rule is anything you go through it and say,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.840]   is there anything in here that I want to remember
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.360]   and I haven't done something with?
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.640]   It didn't change my strategic plan or something,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.880]   but I don't want to forget it.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.040]   It's a good idea.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.280]   You copy that into the next notebook.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.760]   And what tends to happen is only a very small amount
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.160]   of these ideas actually will end up meriting being
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   copied into the next notebook.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.920]   By the time you get to the next notebook,
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.320]   only a very small number of ideas
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.120]   will pass from that one to the next one.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.320]   And so it's a way of making sure things aren't lost,
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.640]   but it also helps you purify.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.760]   What's the idea that I've carried with me
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.280]   through four or five notebooks?
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.160]   That's a signal that maybe I really
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.720]   need to make a change around that
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.360]   or I need to listen to it.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.560]   So yes, that's a good caveat.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   So I do have that Moleskine as well,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   non-work related but critical to my pursuit of the deep life.
