[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   I think the easiest thing for them to get done with doge is
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.400]   the naming the shaming the auditing the transparency of
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.040]   what we're actually spending because so many of the audits
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.780]   shamoff are just not completed. People don't know what's being
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.760]   spent. And if you show Americans a $12,000 hammer, or people with
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.360]   job titles not coming into the office or coming into the
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   office one day a week, one day a month, that's going to infuriate
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.320]   taxpayers. And I think there's a very easy way to navigate all
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.920]   this, you just create the leaderboard, and you not only
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.720]   shame people who are wasting our tax dollars, you celebrate the
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.040]   people who are heroes, who start showing frugality, and cost
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.400]   saving, and they're going to do this with the leaderboard of the
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.880]   heroes and the goats. This could be the unifying not just the
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.920]   Republican Party as a sax is pointing out from off. I think
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.660]   this could unify the whole country. Is there anybody paying
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.440]   taxes that wants to see money wasted that wants to see us pay
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.400]   people high salaries to not come to work? Show off what's your
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.240]   take on the sequence of events here? What are easy layups that
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.520]   they can actually get done? And then where is the machine going
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.360]   to fight and try to stop this thing?
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.320]   I think you are highlighting something that they can do right
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.000]   away, which I think is very powerful, which is just using
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.200]   these distribution channels that Elon has now to create a massive
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.720]   layer of accountability. I do think that sunshine is a really
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.760]   incredible disinfectant. I think the best way that they could
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.640]   start if possible is to stop paying their vendors until you
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.280]   actually have some amount of accounting to figure out as you
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.360]   said, how many $600 soap dispensers are actually being
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.280]   bought and sold now, that kind of whatever you want to call
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.600]   that corruption or grift. It's not going to account for
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.920]   hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars. But I do
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.720]   think that it is a very moral and symbolic win that says we're
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.920]   going to we're going to start to get much more rational and it
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.160]   starts to allow the average American to actually feel like
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.200]   they have a little bit of control and they have a more
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.000]   vested interest in how the government spends money. But I
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.080]   want to actually want to take a step back for a second. And
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.560]   before I talk about what doge can do, I just want to highlight
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.520]   something that's been going on in California, because I think
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.800]   it explains a lot in California. And I'm just going to read this
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.480]   that because it's incredible. The regulatory burden in
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.800]   California as a state from 1997 to 2015. This is when the data
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   is available that I found has increased by almost 50%. As of
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.520]   May of 2022. There are almost 61,000 individual regulations
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.720]   in the state of California. So what does that mean? And where
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.640]   does it come from? And Nick, if you can just put out the tweet,
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.160]   it has happened over a period of time, in which the government
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.120]   has been the absolute singular source of employment in the
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.440]   state. And we talked about this before, where this is also a
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   problem at the federal level when you look at GDP and job
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.640]   growth, because it looks like a lot of these jobs are actually
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.160]   fake manufactured government type jobs. So why is this a
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.680]   problem you've seen in California, the issue that we
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.760]   have is that if you have a growth in the number of
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.440]   employees, in this case, in California, all the job growth
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.080]   in recent memory has been state employees. What is the
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.680]   byproduct regulations go up? What is the byproduct of that
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.080]   there are actually no private sector jobs and more to the
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.400]   point, the private sector fleas. So now let's bubble that up and
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.440]   look at the federal government. Nick, if you want to just show
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.920]   that chart that I that I sent you. What is incredible J Cal is
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.800]   that the more people are hired by the government, lo and behold,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.040]   what do you see, the number of regulations issued by federal
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.560]   agencies has just continued unabated year in year out, you
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.080]   cannot run a country like this. So because the Congress is
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.840]   accumulate, right? Congress is doing less and less of a job
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.520]   actually trying to frame how the country should work. That white
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.680]   space is filled in, as Freeberg said, by these federal agencies,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.840]   it compounds and accumulates. This is not replacing laws. None
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.000]   of these regulations have expiry dates. And so as a result, I
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.360]   think what you probably have is an incredible restraint on the
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.360]   US economy. I think that the US economy could be growing at four
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.160]   or 5%. But the reason that it doesn't grow at four or 5% is in
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.920]   that one single chart, it is impossible to be able to live up
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.480]   to your economic potential when you have this burden on your
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.640]   neck. So I think the real opportunity for doge is to
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.000]   basically do whatever it needs to do using the law to wipe as
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.720]   many of these regulations off the books, we are better cutting
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.120]   them all to zero, and then finding the ones we really need
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.120]   and then repassing those, then we are going at this piecemeal.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.400]   And there's some incredible, there's some incredible ideas,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.320]   by the way, that this creates. Nick, I don't know if you can
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.360]   find this tweet, but doge asked what people think of the IRS.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.000]   And there was an enormous amount of activity that essentially
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.400]   said, give us a flat tax and wipe out the tax code. Yeah,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.640]   people were very flexible in the amount of tax that they were
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.520]   willing to pay. But could you imagine the simplification in
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.840]   the tax code and the implications of that I was in
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.480]   Singapore, by the way, 10 days ago, when I started my trip,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.040]   Nick beep out the name of the person I'm about to say, but I
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.880]   had a long meeting with who you know, is there. And I was asking
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.640]   him the complexity of dealing with taxes. He's like, what do
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.760]   you mean, we don't, we pay a very simple tax system, there's
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.080]   no capital gains in Singapore. And so as a result, our filing
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.880]   requirements are diminimously small. But as a result, people
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.360]   like him, meaning great entrepreneurs, can spend all
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   their time thinking about what to build, not not tax
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.680]   optimization, exactly, or how to account for it. So could you
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.000]   imagine if these guys basically use doge as a mechanism to
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.120]   shrink the tax code, create a flat tax, potentially, I know
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.000]   that that has to be passed by Congress, I understand that. But
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.640]   the idea of just cutting this all the way down, and then
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.520]   finding through that process, what you actually need, I think
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.360]   can find America 100 200 basis points of GDP growth, it could
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.040]   be an economic renaissance.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.000]   I mean, just to build on that, cutting all the regulations to
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.760]   zero, you might have throw out some babies in the bathwater. So
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   why not put a clock on them and just say whenever this was
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.000]   enacted, plus five years, and then it rolls off or plus two
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.160]   years, whatever number of months, and then you could have
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.560]   them come off, rolling off every month.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.880]   I think that's a good idea. But it has to be orderly. I think
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.600]   that's a good idea. But Jake, I think you first have to cancel
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.120]   all these regulations. And then say whatever we need, we will
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.920]   reenact your point on a five year shot clock that then has to
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.160]   be renewed in a new congressional period. And I
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.600]   think that that's extremely healthy. Well, because you know
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.000]   what people die, paradigms shift, and then nobody even
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.640]   remembers these regulations, you have to do archaeology to figure
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.080]   out who created this, what was the intent, and you would never
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.160]   do that you would never live sacks with all of these rules
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.800]   forever.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.520]   Just one last comment in fairness to these government
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.320]   employees. The one thing is that it's not their fault, right?
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.840]   Meaning in the sense that they were hired into a regime, where
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   the incentive was to regulate so that you had things to oversee.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.640]   And so they did their job. In fact, I would say they did their
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.320]   job incredibly well. But the point is that now we need to
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.160]   pivot for them to do a totally different job.
