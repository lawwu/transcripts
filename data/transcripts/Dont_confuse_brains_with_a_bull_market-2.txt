[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about a couple things
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.020]   One the ultimate source of financial security your strong mind and two never to confuse
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.400]   Brains with a bull market. I remember back in college interviewing for this Anderson consulting guy
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.600]   The consulting companies were the most coveted jobs out of the College of William and Mary
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.800]   And I got rejected from all of them and the guy was clearly not impressed with me
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.560]   Because I was telling him about my interest in investing in the stock market and so forth and he said sam
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.680]   Don't confuse brains with a bull market
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.960]   Bulls make money bears make money pigs get slaughtered. So that was the end of the interview and I was like, well, okay
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.560]   I guess i'm not getting a job at enter consulting which ended up going bust
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.960]   And the story really reminds me of right now. I mean investors are making money hand over fist
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.200]   We're coming up with investment ideas and they're actually working
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.280]   For example the lifetime group stock idea about health and fitness gym stocks being the last reopening trade
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.280]   It's done. Well
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.280]   It's done well along with planet fitness and a bunch of other old school fitness companies
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.640]   And now i'm thinking to myself man. Am I an investing genius? I wrote out a thesis
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.280]   I recorded a podcast about health and fitness stocks and now the stock is up 25 percent in
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.080]   One or two weeks man. Maybe I should go get a job as a money manager
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.520]   And then again, I think to myself well don't confuse brains with a bull market
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360]   It's impossible to consistently outperform the market
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.760]   The ideas you think are because of your connecting the dots
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.260]   Might just be because the overall market has a tremendous amount of liquidity
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.080]   And things just go up because money is trying to find
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.720]   More profitable investments in a low interest rate environment. So if you're starting to feel a little giddy a little
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.480]   Overconfident that you're just such a great trader
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.280]   Just start looking back at history
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.140]   Look back to the dot-com bubble in 2000 when the nasdaq
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.940]   Basically imploded by about 65 over the course of two years the sp500
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.840]   Imploded by about 40 something percent over the course of two years
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.980]   Then of course the global financial crisis in 2008 and 9 and it wasn't until about 2012
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.200]   When stocks regained their pre-crisis highs and then started marching upwards. So if you've only been investing since
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.520]   about 2009
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.080]   You've only seen really good good good times. There's only one year
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.200]   I think it was 2018 where the markets were down about five or six percent
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.320]   Which is not that big of a deal after such a tremendous increase
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.560]   So really be careful about thinking that you can outperform the market consistently over the long term
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.040]   Because you probably can't and if you look at the data over the past 10 years
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.600]   institutional fund managers
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.560]   In other words people who are financial analysts and money managers
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.800]   Who do this for a living?
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.840]   They most of them for the equity side haven't been able to outperform their respective indices
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.560]   So about 80 percent have not outperformed their respective indices. So those are bad odds
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.160]   So for you and me to think that we can outperform when you know, we've got young kids to raise at home
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:30.080]   We've got other types of jobs other types of interests. We don't spend, you know all day watching the markets listening to earnings conference calls
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.040]   Watching the federal reserve talk about interest rates and bond tapering and so forth. It's going to be really hard
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.140]   I think we can get lucky for you know, several years several positions
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.560]   But long-term sustainability is very very difficult and you might be wondering what am I going to do with my lifetime fitness investment?
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.040]   I invested about thirty thousand dollars in it and twenty thousand dollars in another company called metafast. I'm just gonna ride it
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'm gonna ride it because I think the trend is our friend through the first half of 2022
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.560]   I think we're gonna see the biggest year of people trying to get back in shape
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.200]   Live a yellow lifestyle spend their money. I think it's going to be great
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.020]   2022
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.320]   So i'm just going to ride the momentum and see what happens and this investment
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.680]   And investing in general brings me to my other point a main point and that is the desire for financial security
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.980]   When we are investing and saving and working hard
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.740]   We ultimately desire financial security so we don't have to think about money so much
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.260]   I mean thinking about whether we made the right investment whether you're going to get laid off during the next round of layoffs
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.900]   Whether we chose the right partner because they've got terrible credit score and they just spend while you're the saver
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.380]   You know
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.300]   These are all things that uh hurt financial security that messes with your mind and it just kind of keeps you
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.060]   a little bit anxious and in a positive way this anxiety is good for you because it is the
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.940]   Counterbalancing mechanism for you to not slack off so much to not
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.060]   Spend all your money you need some of that stress and anxiety to keep you focused
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.300]   Especially if you're a parent, you know, if you're a parent the stakes go up
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.300]   You're not only taking care of yourself and your spouse and your partner
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.340]   Hopefully but your children and your children are the most precious assets in the world and you would do anything
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.700]   To love and care for and protect your children and I believe most of us are irrational over the long term
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.860]   So if you desire money, you're going to save more money and if you've had hardships growing up
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.940]   You're probably going to save more money and I do believe your upbringing does help determine
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.600]   Your outlook on money how you view money. Is it a healthy relationship?
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.220]   Or is it an unhealthy relationship?
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.660]   And so when I talked about perpetual failure in a previous post
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.220]   As the reason why I continue to save and invest over 50 percent of any investment income and online income I make
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.460]   It's because growing up. I saw a lot of poverty in malaysia in china and in india
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.820]   And it really kind of affected the way I saw life and when I was working at mcdonald's for four dollars an hour and constantly
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:20.620]   Getting yelled at by the overzealous manager. I just remember thinking myself. There's no way I want to be stuck
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.060]   Slaving away in front of a hot stove for six hours a day
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.300]   Making four dollars an hour. I mean, that's that's terrible. I mean it brings and builds character
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.780]   And it makes you appreciate what you have but over the long term. It's a really tough way to live
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.660]   So i've come to realize that it really is your strong mind
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.300]   Your investing acumen
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.680]   Your knowledge your education that really is going to provide you some type of financial security
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.500]   Just think about a scenario where you lose 90 of your net worth
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   You also lose your job. Thanks to a recession and then for good measure
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.300]   You also break your leg, which you require to do your job
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.380]   Are you screwed? Well, most people would say yes
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.060]   But are you really are you really when I used to play a lot of texas no limit hold'em
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.020]   There would be a time where i'd get some bad beats, right?
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.900]   So bad beats are when you're favored your odds are favored to win
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.740]   But your opponent spikes something on the river and takes all your money
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.540]   And it was really disheartening
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.260]   However, I would always tell myself a chip and a chair is all I need to come back
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.820]   And that's a common saying in the poker world. You can run bad, but a chip and a chair
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.300]   That's all you need and you can fight your way back
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.260]   If all goes to hell we still have our minds
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.180]   Our mind is our last resource of financial security because we can always find ways to make money
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.100]   And with this type of attitude, I sometimes did come back and I think you've got to believe
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.100]   That your mind will help you in the darkest of hours
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.900]   And so I thought about what would I do if I lost a lot of my net worth?
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.980]   And I had to take care of my family
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:05.100]   Well, I think the number one thing I would do would be to try to think about investment ideas that could help pay for
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:12.940]   Our living expenses, of course, I would go through my budget cut costs and find ways to make more money through active income
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:18.460]   But I would look for investment ideas like LTH the lifetime fitness group, which now is enough
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.340]   To pay for a month's worth of living expenses
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.240]   But the reality is I know it's not sustainable
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.820]   So in addition to all of us trying to build a strong
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.980]   investing mind
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.460]   I think it's probably more important to develop an
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.540]   Entrepreneurial mind really good entrepreneurial acumen
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.460]   So in other words when you've lost your job and your net worth is down in the dumps
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.580]   Will you have the entrepreneurial mind to make money on your own?
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:51.820]   This is super important with entrepreneurship. There's a much stronger correlation with effort and reward
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:59.420]   For example here in the personal finance world. There are plenty of writers and podcasters who have no financial background
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.060]   And you would think well, how is that possible that they can grow and make money online?
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.460]   It's possible because they have a very strong entrepreneurial mind
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:15.100]   They know how to market. They know how to grow a brand. They know how to convince the search engines. They've got great product
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.340]   And that is just the way it is
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:25.100]   That's capitalism and that is a wild wild west open forum where anybody can compete. That's the beauty of technology on the internet
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.780]   Now with good investing acumen the correlation with investing success is not as strong
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.380]   You might know all there is to know about analyzing a cash flow statement
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.260]   However, if you can't properly predict what other people are thinking after the results
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:47.260]   Well, you can still lose so be very careful about getting lulled into only making money from a day job
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.320]   Your day job is like a warm cocoon
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.580]   Paying you the benefits paying you a nice salary every two weeks. It's great
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.860]   I remember that time and it just lulls you into a little bit of complacency where you're not
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.460]   Bothering to try to make more money outside of work
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:10.300]   But I really think you should try you should try because there's nothing better than making a dollar
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:15.100]   With your own creativity and hard work. It's really interesting compared to making a dollar
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.940]   For a company it's just night and day. I think the value
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.380]   That you get out of making your own dollar is like
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.260]   I don't know five times more five times greater because if you didn't do anything nothing would happen
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.980]   But at your day job if you decide to slack off, you know half the day or the whole week
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.800]   You're still going to get paid and the company's probably still going to make money. So once you have that confidence
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.340]   To make your own money
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.820]   You're going to feel a lot more financially secure and to build a strong financial mind
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.380]   It just takes practice and it takes studying
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.580]   listening to podcasts reading articles
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.820]   watching videos
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.220]   You will learn and the more you learn the more confident you will feel
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.380]   and better yet
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.380]   The greater the ability for you to make money by taking action and you can tell who has a weak mind
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.820]   Just spend any amount of time on social media twitter in particular
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.660]   If you have a weak mind you tend to get agitated more easily
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:18.220]   You start getting into useless online arguments because someone doesn't believe the way you believe you try to convince them
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.260]   Otherwise when there's no amount of effort you can put in to convince someone otherwise
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.260]   But if you have a strong mind, you're more open to seeing the other side
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.720]   There is no way of knowing everything you've got to be humble when it comes to investing
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.580]   And when it comes to trying to build your wealth because there will be landmines that you will step on
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.180]   That you will have no idea about you will have not seen them
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.260]   Therefore the logical thing to do is learn from others who've experienced what you might one day experience
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.140]   In other words a strong mind is also an open mind
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.880]   So let's keep on learning and sharing our experiences
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.060]   Even if whatever I write or say doesn't fully agree with you. Just think maybe
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.180]   I have a perspective that you do not have and embrace that and i'm going to do the same
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.940]   Whenever I read something that's critical a little bit nasty or just totally out in left field
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.180]   I like to think well, maybe they have a point i'm missing
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.220]   Even if you receive tough love embrace it so you can try and get stronger
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.500]   It's nice to know that if all else fails we can always fight our way back
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.220]   And that is I think the secret to feeling more financially secure
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.860]   Thanks so much everyone for listening. If you enjoyed this episode, I'd love a positive review
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.420]   Shout out to Stephen M
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:44.060]   Bamma trader JT for leaving those five-star reviews. I really appreciate it helps keep us going and it helps make things fun
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:51.340]   I'm going to continue to do some writing and some recording on reflecting on this year and over the past 520 years
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:57.980]   I think it's good to reflect folks and to really try to appreciate how far we've come and what we have
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.700]   Also, i'll be finishing up the first
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.020]   Draft of the finished manuscript of my book this month
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.540]   And by the end of the year, it should be all tidied and squared away
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.800]   And the book is going to come out june 2022
