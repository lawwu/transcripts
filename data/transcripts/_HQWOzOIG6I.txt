[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   I'm trying to get into calmer states prior to sleep and some ways to do that.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.320]   I'm a big fan, and I've talked a lot before on this podcast about things like yoga nidra,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.580]   which is a non-movement-based practice, sometimes called non-sleep-deep rest, where people actually
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.000]   take some time each day to practice how to go into a more parasympathetic, a.k.a. relaxed
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.680]   state deliberately, because it's a bit of a skill.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.840]   There's some good data, really, mostly out of a laboratory in Scandinavia, showing huge
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:39.480]   increases in nigrostriatal dopamine when people basically engage in a practice of deliberate
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.160]   non-movement and that the brain actually enters states of very shallow sleep, so sort of nap-ish,
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.080]   but the idea is to actually stay awake but motionless, and it does seem to restore a
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.240]   certain number of features of neurochemistry, but perhaps more importantly, it teaches people
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.840]   to relax, which is something that most people are not very good at, but in any event, and
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.840]   people who listen to this podcast have heard me say this over and over again, so I sound
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.560]   like a broken record, but this practice, as a zero-cost practice that doesn't require
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.640]   any pharmacology, does seem to really enhance people's ability to fall asleep more quickly
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.920]   and to fall back asleep if they wake up in the middle of the night, so in any event,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.040]   another plug for NSDR, yoga nidra.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280]   Well, I just also want to add to that.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.200]   That's one of the reasons why insomnia is so insidious, is because when people feel
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.920]   like they haven't gotten enough sleep and aren't getting enough sleep, then they become
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.560]   anxious about getting enough sleep, and then you're anxious before going to sleep, like
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.920]   I'm not going to fall asleep, it's going to be 45 minutes in, and then that's a positive
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.840]   feedback loop, so you need to break that loop, say, "Okay, my body's going to get as much
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   sleep as it needs.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.960]   I needn't worry about it," and then practice this relaxation to say, "Hey, it's all okay.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.020]   It's going to be all right," and then concentrate on things that relax you, whether it's concentrating
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.980]   or not concentrating, whatever it is.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:07.460]   You mentioned yoga nidra, and that reminded me of transcendental meditation, which is
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.400]   something that also hasn't been studied well, largely because we can't ask non-human animals
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.680]   to do it, and so we don't know what's happening with our neurochemistry and our brain activity.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.880]   It's in a deep and meaningful way, but one thing that has been shown and those that can
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.160]   do it really well is that that theta activity that I said happens when you're learning something
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:40.120]   or when you're in REM sleep, it's well-established and increases during the transcendental meditation,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.680]   so it might be that some states of meditation could in some ways replace or mimic some functions
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.440]   of, for example, REM sleep.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.880]   But again, we don't know if all the neurochemistry is right to do, for example, the thing that
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.240]   I was talking about, which is erasing the novelty encoding structures of the brain.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.040]   That needs an absence of norepinephrine and serotonin, which we don't know if that goes
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.840]   away with transcendental meditation.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.280]   We just don't know the answer to that yet.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.240]   The studies on yoga nidra and sleep replacement are kind of interesting.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.000]   It does seem to be the case that nothing can really replace sleep except sleep, but that
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.520]   if one is sleep-deprived or is having trouble falling back asleep, that these things like
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.320]   – and I hear it's – I acknowledge this is essentially like yoga nidra, but we now
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.960]   call it non-sleep deep rest or NSDR because oftentimes names like yoga nidra act as a
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.240]   kind of a barrier for what would otherwise be people willing to try a practice.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   It sounds mystical.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   Meditation and yoga, yeah.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.720]   It sounds like flying carpets and – it sounds like you have to go to Esalen.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.040]   By the way, Esalen's a beautiful place, but it sounds like you have to go there or
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.480]   live in the West Coast to believe in this stuff, but it's simply not the case.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.600]   These are practices that are really just self-directed relaxation as a practice that allows people
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.840]   to get better and better at directing their brain states towards more relaxation.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.160]   Most people have an asymmetry.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.960]   For instance, most people can force themselves to stay up later, but they have a hard time
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.400]   going to sleep earlier, and that just speaks to the asymmetry that's probably adaptive
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.000]   and survival-based that we can ramp ourselves up far more easily than we can tend to calm
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   ourselves down.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.520]   Actually, to appeal to other Christians like me, prayer can be a wonderful way to calm
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.320]   yourself down because through prayer, you're giving your cares to God and saying – and
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.800]   then you are relaxed, more relaxed.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.560]   And I just want to say that because the same reason that yoga might put some people off,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:50.000]   it might put some people off to talk about prayer, but it's the same process of being
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.200]   able to relax and – yeah.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.560]   And get outside our own experience a little bit.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.760]   Get outside our own experience, yeah.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.240]   Back out, get a worldview that might actually also help us to relax.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.000]   Well, you might be surprised at how many clinicians and scientists who've come on this podcast
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.840]   have mentioned things like prayer from various perspectives, Christianity, Judaism, Muslim
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.760]   traditions, and others, that as a parallel to all of these things.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.040]   And I think what it speaks to is the fact that ultimately the biological architectures
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.600]   that we're all contending with are going to be identical, right?
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.840]   And so different ways to tap into them and ones that are congruent with people's beliefs,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.640]   I think, are great.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.220]   Because anything non-congruent with your beliefs is also stressful.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.220]   And feels forced.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.480]   And that's why this idea of calling it non-sleep deep rest in addition to yoga nidra was not
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.760]   to detract from the naming or the history around yoga nidra, but I was finding that
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.520]   it was a barrier.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.400]   Likewise, yoga nidra tends to include things like intentions, whereas NSDR scripts – and
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.080]   by the way, we will provide links to some NSDR and yoga nidra scripts, but NSDR has
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   no intentions.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.240]   It's simply a body scan deep relaxation base.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.600]   So it's sort of the scientific version of all of this stuff, and actually we study it
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.080]   in the laboratory and some of the brain states that people go into, but that's a discussion
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   for another time.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.740]   Well, another thing – this is hard now.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.960]   My mother used to tell me when I would complain, "I can't go to sleep," she'd say, "Well,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.520]   you know, start with your toes and relax."
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.360]   So you would clench your muscles around your toes and relax them and do that all the way
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.160]   from your toes all the way to your head.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.440]   And I don't know where she got this.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.880]   It might have been her own common sense, or she might have gotten it from this NPR show
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.880]   that's called The Mind Can Keep You Well, she used to listen to.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.720]   But that's another intentional relaxation that focuses on the body rather than on your
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.480]   own mental processes.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.340]   I do a little bit of work with the military, and there's a method within certain communities
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.760]   of special operations in the U.S. military where if they can't sleep or they're having
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.680]   challenges sleeping, they will deliberately try and relax their facial muscles in particular,
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.840]   like sort of drape the facial muscles and use long or exhale-emphasized breathing does
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.800]   seem to increase the probability of transitioning back into sleep.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.160]   And those are hallmarks of yoga nidra, non-sleep deep rest, body scans.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.040]   And so I think all of these things converge on a common theme.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.080]   You know, as neurobiologists, we can say all of the things that we're describing certainly
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.000]   move the needle away from locus coeruleus activation.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.720]   I mean, we haven't done the experiment to really look at that, but it seems all these
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.480]   things are counter to noradrenaline release.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   - Right.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.480]   Another one is yawning.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.320]   Yawning in itself is that kind of sort of tensing of all the muscles in your face and
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.640]   then relaxing them.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.440]   So it might be why we yawn.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.000]   We don't know why we yawn yet, but it might also be really great.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.880]   The animals yawn too, you know.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.660]   - My bulldog was a perpetual, if he wasn't sleeping, he was yawning.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.520]   - And it would be interesting to see what yawning does to the locus coeruleus.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.840]   Does that also come and switch locus coeruleus activity?
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:06.000]   Because it's interesting that facial nerve, like trigeminal nerve, you know, through the
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:20.160]   vagus connects indirectly to the locus coeruleus and has powerful effect on that.
