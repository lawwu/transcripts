[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   A pastor who listens to this podcast writes in to ask a tricky leadership question.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.320]   Pastor John, what should a church council or board do if one of their pastors asks to
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.720]   officiate a same-sex wedding?
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.640]   Pastor John, what counsel would you have for this church?
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.880]   Tony, I don't feel like I can answer that question without dropping one level down,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.560]   because this is so sensitive and explosive and politically agitating that I want to go
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.040]   down to the bottom again and then come back up to the practical questions.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.880]   I think the practical question is relatively easy once you get the other things sorted
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.920]   out, which are not easy.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:58.920]   The emotional and physical sensations that we call same-sex attraction are disordered
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.640]   emotions and disordered sensations.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.480]   And that disordering of the soul's emotions and the body's sensations are rooted in the
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.800]   fall of humanity into sin.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.600]   And more specifically, Paul says, they're rooted in the sin that's understood as exchanging
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.280]   God's glory for images, Romans 1:23.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.880]   So the exchange of woman as the glory of man for another man is a parable of the exchange
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.840]   of God for images like ourselves.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.980]   So a person who experiences this disordering of the emotions of the soul and the sensations
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.040]   of the body may or may not himself exchange God for images.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.140]   He may be a Christian, but the disordering he's experiencing is rooted in that original
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.920]   sin and in that ongoing human bent of soul that we all have, all of us.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.960]   So the issue becomes, what do we do with the disordering effects of sin in our lives?
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.760]   I say our lives, and you'll see why in a minute, John Piper's life.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.120]   The Bible says that if we embrace the disordering as good and normal and live our lives in accord
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.560]   with the disordered inclinations, then we will be living and affirming a parable of
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.840]   rebellion against God.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.400]   And the Bible says those who live out that kind of rebellion do not enter the kingdom
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   of heaven.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.800]   That's 1 Corinthians 6.9.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.680]   Now that has nothing, get this, that has nothing to do with the peculiar nature of sexual disordering
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.960]   or same-sex desires.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.240]   Nothing.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.520]   This is true for all our disordering of all our lives rooted in sin.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:19.240]   That's why 1 Corinthians 6.9 and 10 lists homosexual practices along with others.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.280]   So here's the list.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.480]   Do not be deceived, neither sexually immoral, that's fornication because it's distinguished
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:37.160]   from the next two, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:50.480]   nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:00.080]   In other words, if you embrace and live out as normal and good any of these, you perish
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.120]   because you're living a parable of rebellion.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.840]   So we all experience temptation to sin on a spectrum of intensity.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.580]   There are occasional thieves and there are kleptomaniacs.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.640]   There are people who occasionally drink too much and there are alcoholics.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.940]   There are those who commit adultery once and never again, and there are predators.
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.680]   There are those who experimented with same-sex for a season.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.040]   Maybe they were in prison, maybe they were a teenager, and they don't anymore.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.640]   And there are those who celebrate it and pursue it as normal.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:49.560]   And Paul's point is that if you embrace adultery as good and normal, or if you embrace stealing
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:58.300]   as good and normal, or if you embrace greed as good and normal, or if you embrace drunkenness
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:06.820]   as good and normal, or if you embrace homosexual intercourse as good and normal, you will not
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.600]   enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.920]   This is not rooted in the nature of the sexual sin.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.320]   This is rooted in sin and rebellion, regardless of what the issue is.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.080]   Now we're getting to the question.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   Officiating at a so-called same-sex wedding is the same as putting your blessing on the
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.080]   choice of two people to commit eternal suicide.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.640]   The pastor is solemnizing and making official and blessing their choice not to enter the
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.480]   kingdom of heaven.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:49.140]   Now I would say that if a pastor asks his board if he can do that, he has given a signal
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.280]   he's disqualified from his role of leading the sheep into the kingdom of heaven, which
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.720]   is his job.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.400]   And so he has put himself in a position of needing church discipline.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.600]   And his board should follow the principles of Matthew 18 to seek his repentance as gently
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.240]   and patiently as they can.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.240]   And then if he does not repent of his willingness to bless people's eternal suicide and thus
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.140]   lead them out of the kingdom of heaven and into destruction, he should be dismissed as
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:29.400]   a false shepherd from both the pastorate and the church.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:36.560]   With regard to two men or two women who ask to be married, a pastor should ask to meet
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.680]   with them, I think, if they're willing, in order to explain to them as patiently and
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.960]   carefully, lovingly as he can, why he recommends to them that they not go forward with their
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.520]   plans for the sake of their own soul.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.640]   And in that process, hopefully he will share the gospel and invite them to life in Christ
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.200]   and to his church.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.120]   These days, Tony, are, as you know, things are in the news even as we record down in
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.840]   Indiana and so on, these are days when all Christians, especially pastors and church
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:28.180]   leaders need to stand rock solid on biblical teachings about God's good and beautiful plan
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.880]   for sexuality without any swagger and without any fear.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.240]   American culture is in the midst of a passionate pursuit of self-destruction.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:49.160]   So our demeanor should be a mixture of sorrow and compassion and anger and total confidence
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:57.000]   that our God is in control and will attain his Christ-exalting, church-purifying, mission-completing
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   purposes.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.760]   Boy, that is sobering.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.780]   Thank you for the warning, Pastor John.
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.280]   There are many related episodes in the archives that are brought to my mind when we talk about
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   this.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.560]   Pastor John, you addressed the question, "Will you marry a heterosexual couple that is already
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.620]   living together?" back in episode number 365.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.160]   We talked about, "Would you attend a gay wedding?" back in episode number 191.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.600]   And of course, we have talked about the fight against same-sex desires, like back in episode
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.800]   number 454.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.700]   All of these episodes can be found in the Ask Pastor John app for the Apple and Android

[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.160]   Well, should a couple who is expecting their fourth child pray for a certain gender for
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.220]   a boy or for a girl?
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.280]   And is such a preference wrong?
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   A couple in India wants to know, and Pastor John will answer tomorrow.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
