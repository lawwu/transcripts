[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   if the mission was to be open source, and then you realize
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.480]   you've got something super valuable, and you close source
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.560]   it, create a for profit, and then take all the employees and
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.040]   all the IP and put it into the for profit, lock it down, break
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.280]   the original mission that hey, this was going to help humanity
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.620]   because we're going to make it open source. So if you donate
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.680]   money here, and we get the tax exemption, humanity benefits,
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.560]   because everybody gets to look at that code at the same time
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.520]   and work on it and iterate, they've just basically stolen
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.000]   all that in order to enrich themselves, they took an open
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.120]   source project, they closed it, they raised money. And then
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.440]   within the next two years on this incredible innovation, they
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.960]   sold $2 billion and put that in their pockets. That's where I
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   think this whole thing is going to get really crazy, right?
