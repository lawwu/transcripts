[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   Well, most people just look at me as the guy that runs and yells as he's running.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.320]   And while I do that, you know, to motivate people, but people don't understand that my
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.320]   day is broken up into segments.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240]   I work out, I eat, I sleep, but I spend most of my time studying.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.200]   So like I'm in the medical world, I'm a paramedic in Canada, but I spend a lot of my time trying
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.320]   to nuke every single thing about it, because I'm not trying to just be a paramedic, learn
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.840]   about veins and arteries and how the heart pumps and stuff like that.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.880]   I'm trying to learn to the point where I can save someone's life.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.800]   And even though paramedics are doing that all over the world, I'm trying to be that
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.200]   paramedic that can really dissect exactly what's going on and figure out, you know,
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.120]   what medication goes where, just trying to, you know, just trying to learn, you know,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.360]   the algorithm of what's going on, man.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.840]   So I spend a lot of time with it.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.240]   I love the word algorithm, because when I teach biology or try and learn anything that's
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.440]   related to biology, especially the human body, I need to know the nouns, but it's the verbs
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440]   that matter.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   And that's really what you're talking about.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.600]   Like, like just saying that, that sits there, that brain part there doesn't tell you how
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.400]   it all works together.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.880]   So what is your process for studying look like?
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.800]   Like if we dropped a camera in the room, but a microphone into that, into your inner dialogue,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   right?
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.240]   Gosh, wouldn't, wouldn't we all love that.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.480]   But if we dropped a microphone into your inner dialogue, are you waking up looking at the
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.800]   books and going, yeah, fresh day, let's learn, or is some of the same resistance that you've
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.880]   talked about coming up around physical work?
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.520]   Is that coming up from time to time?
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   You know what?
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   I was nervous at first.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.320]   I'm gonna keep the mother, I'm gonna keep it real, I'm gonna keep it real.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.920]   So I'm not a real smart guy.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.680]   And what I mean by that is I was born with ADD, ADHD, like my brain cannot retain information.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.960]   I'm not some genetic freak when it comes to running, when it comes to lifting weights,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.840]   I am absolutely the bottom of the barrel.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.000]   And people will never believe me.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.480]   And they can just, you know, whatever, believe what you want to believe.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.400]   So when you asked me this question about what does studying look like for me, I have to
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.320]   go over the same page over and over and over and over again.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.200]   While Jennifer can look at that page while she's, you know, quizzing me, she'll learn
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.020]   it right then as she's chilling on anything about it.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.720]   She will quiz herself or quiz me and learn it as she's quizzing me.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's the most frustrating thing in the world how my brain works.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.280]   So what I do is I literally sit there with a pen and paper, and I have my books, and
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.040]   I go through and have to write everything down every single day.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.360]   I will study the same page until it's photographic memory from writing the same thing down.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.500]   And then from there, I'll go back through and relearn again.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.640]   So I'll learn the bulk of it, but then I'll go through and learn the small things within
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   that.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.880]   So if it's a medication, I'll learn what the medication does.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.360]   Sometimes I'll learn how to even say the medication, because these medications aren't like, you
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.960]   know, like albuterol.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.600]   No, it's very big words.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.360]   So I'll go through and learn how to say the name, and I'll go through, learn what the
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   dose is.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.600]   Then I'll go through, and this is like every single day, it's not like, "Oh, I got it.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   Let's just go through."
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.480]   No, nothing is, "I got it."
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.080]   Every single thing, so I can't wait to get in this conversation because everything I
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.800]   do in life, it sucks.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.680]   Everything I do in life, it sucks.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.800]   That's why when I was 300 pounds and 24 years old, it wasn't like I had some big epiphany
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.600]   of, "Let's just go be a Navy SEAL and let's lose some weight."
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.400]   No, I knew my entire life was going to be a struggle, which is why I just ignored it.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.800]   And I said, "I'm not even trying to jump off into this shit and learn how to read, how
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.680]   to write, how to memorize, how to become something I am not."
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.960]   But through that process, something happened to me, and I realized, this is why I feel
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.200]   sorry for no one.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.000]   In this podcast, they're going to really not like me because people are going to think
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.120]   that I am maybe lying or maybe fibbing or exaggerating.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:42.640]   No, I am literally, I was the lowest form on earth, no talent, no ability to learn,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.880]   and I literally know what it is to be rock bottom and to build that up.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.280]   So that question about learning, it's a pain in my ass, and I don't have to do it.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.560]   So think about it, I'm 49 years old and I'm a multimillionaire.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.940]   I don't have to do anything.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.680]   So all I thought about when I was growing up is, "Man, I can't wait to one day get to
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.320]   the point where I no longer have to do this stuff."
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.240]   But what happens, I got older, it became a way of living.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.600]   So how I do every day is how I do every day.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   It's a discipline.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.360]   It's a regimen.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.800]   It was a choice I made.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.620]   And the choice I made was, what are you willing to sacrifice, and what are you willing to
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.960]   give up to find every bit of who you are as a human being?
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.120]   And I was willing to give up everything to do that.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.600]   So studying is no joke.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   - I love that you're studying.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.920]   And I recall a few years ago, I heard some interview or podcast with you, and you just
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.320]   threw out like, "I don't know what I'll do next.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.760]   Maybe I'll be a scientist."
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   And I went, "Yeah."
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   I was like, 'cause I knew, 'cause I know you a bit, and I see your work out there, but
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.640]   we'd met before, that if you decided that, you were gonna do it.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.520]   And learning medicine, which is what you're doing, learning human physiology is so detailed.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.720]   And people out there have to understand, when you look at a textbook and you see the veins
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.200]   and the capillaries, different colors, when the body's open, they're not different colors.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.060]   So I mean, some things have different color contrast, but it's not like it's all labeled
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.780]   when you pop it open.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.280]   And so the process of writing things down by hand is important for you.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.760]   So you go back and read those notes.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.760]   Do you think about that stuff on your runs too?
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.880]   Are you segmenting your day?
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   Like when you're done studying, are you heading out for a run and thinking about other things,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.440]   or are you still rehearsing the material in your head?
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.240]   So when I write it down, I write it down and I'm able to, I'm actually looking down at
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.000]   this table right now, 'cause I'm back to writing.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.160]   So I'm actually there right now as I'm speaking to you.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.320]   I write it down in a way that I'm memorizing page 69.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.260]   So I'm writing it down, so then writing it down in that page synced together in my brain.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.880]   So I'm looking at the book in my brain right now.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.320]   So that's just how it works for me, and I have to do it over and over again.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.600]   So that page is stuck in my mind.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.240]   So I'm literally flipping through pages as I'm taking these tests, and I'm taking these
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.360]   national tests to become a paramedic or become a advanced EMT or whatever.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:25.440]   I'm literally, as I'm taking that test, I'm going through and I'm flipping pages in my
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.280]   head of where that page was, and how I do that is just from how I write it and how it's
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   on the page.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.960]   When I run, I can't recall any of it.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.640]   I cannot bring any of that because I'm running.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.920]   How my mind is wired now is that everything I do is what I do, because the focus it takes
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.320]   for me to, like right now, I'm running.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.760]   I'm not like a great runner.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.920]   I'm not like injury-free.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.040]   So my first 20 minutes of the run, I'm limping.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.880]   I'm literally limping because I've had several knee surgeries, and my body was twisted, and
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.600]   so now it's untwisting.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.040]   So people look at me, "Oh, it looks like he's limping when he runs."
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.920]   I am limping when I run.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.480]   My body's jacked up, so I'm focusing on how to get the best out of a broken body.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.760]   So everything I do is a total focus on what I'm doing at that point in my life.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.360]   So it seems like you've really trained away or somehow gotten away from the ADD that you
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.240]   mentioned, because what you described is like a deep trench, like a V-shaped trench.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.560]   I'm imagining like there's a ball bearing, and it's like, and it can only go forward
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.520]   in that trench or back, and it goes forward.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.960]   It's not like sliding around at the concave at the bottom, like a tension.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.160]   So it's like you've trained that up.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.200]   Is there a similar feeling when you're in the full focus of running versus full focus
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   of studying?
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.320]   Is it kind of feel like, "Oh yeah, that's the same groove, but different thing," or
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   is it just completely different world?
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.560]   It's a completely different world.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.680]   It's just both of them for me, it's suffering, but it's suffering a whole different way.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.840]   Like when I was going through school, I'll never forget, I think I was in third grade.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:18.800]   And back then, ADD, ADHD, wasn't like, "Here's this medicine or here's this thing."
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.040]   They want to put you in a special school.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.440]   So for me, I was so far behind in learning that their big thing was, "Let's just put
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.960]   him in a special school because he'll never learn."
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.560]   And through that process of like, "I don't want to be in a special school.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.520]   I don't want to be treated any differently."
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.520]   It really, like I never took medication, I've never taken medication for this.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.280]   That's why right now you see me looking right in your eyes, what the hell is human saying
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   right now?
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.600]   And that's why I don't feel bad for people who have ADHD, who have learning disabilities.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.880]   And some are impossible because you just can't, but a lot of them you can.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.280]   And but people don't want to go through the process of focus, of teaching yourself how
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.560]   to truly focus.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.880]   This is where my message gets lost.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.760]   It gets lost because I may say, you know, MF or F, you know, I may be because that's
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:22.400]   the passion that comes out of me because that's, it takes everything for me to learn a sentence.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.880]   So when I speak about David Goggins, I can't speak about David Goggins in a way that's
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.440]   just calm and cool.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   Because when I wake up, I know the journey that it takes for me to find my greatness.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.680]   And it's hard, every, nothing is easy.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.760]   Nothing just like, oh, I wake up and I just do this or I do that, or it just, you know,
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.880]   I watch people every day go through life and it's so easy.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.140]   For me to be where I'm at today, it takes every bit of me.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.120]   So when I speak about it, and as I get going here, you'll start seeing me, the temple will
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.880]   rise, the passion will come out because I'm back there.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.160]   I'm doing what I do every day to become a human being.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.280]   And so nothing is easy.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.920]   Like running is running, it sucks, but you have a choice to make.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.680]   Do you want to sit down and go back to that guy you once were?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   No.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.960]   So this is what it takes.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.600]   It takes that misunderstanding of people and they'll never get it because they were never
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.520]   David Goggins.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.640]   So that is what it takes for me to do what I do.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.820]   It may take you something differently.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.920]   So for me, everything has to be in the study.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   Everything has to be into this.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.200]   It has to be in everywhere I am, it has to be there.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   Me, focus where I am.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.400]   That's why you're my second podcast I've done since Rogan, since the book came out.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.800]   I don't have time for that shit because if I want to be great, I'm not trying to maximize
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.680]   money or maximize people knowing me.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.800]   I do these things because maybe someone out there will understand me and get it and say,
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.480]   I can grow from this guy and others just won't.
