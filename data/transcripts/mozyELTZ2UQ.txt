[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   Well, happy Good Friday, or so we call it.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.000]   It is a joyful day, even if it is the most solemn day in the Church calendar.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.200]   And today we celebrate the cross of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.980]   Last time we looked at the historical and the physical horrors of crucifixion, which
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.280]   was quite honestly heartbreaking and sickening.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.120]   But there are glories in the cross that go far beyond the physical spectacle that can
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.280]   be dramatized in violence and blood on the big screen.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.800]   But because these are theological and spiritual glories, they often go ignored or even denied
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.560]   in our culture, which leads to today's question from Jessica, a listener in Davis, California.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.360]   "Pastor John, as I talk with 20-somethings about Christ and the gospel, I have repeatedly
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.280]   had people say that they don't believe that someone else paying the punishment for another
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.280]   is just.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.280]   I too have internal pushbacks against this, but have come to know that substitutionary
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.240]   atonement has its roots in the Mosaic sacrificial system.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.280]   Our generation, however, at least in California, is biblically illiterate and doesn't have
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.840]   this framework.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.040]   How would you explain the justice of substitutionary atonement to this generation?"
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.000]   Well, not much more could be more important than the question of whether Christ was in
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.040]   fact a just and merciful substitute for sinners, so that when he died for his elect, he actually
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.480]   bore their punishment so that they can experience no condemnation.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.840]   That is the heart of the Christian gospel.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.920]   If that goes, everything goes, and let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280]   perish.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.860]   Now there are at least two issues here.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:01.920]   One is how biblical authority relates to the categories of thought in people's minds,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   and the other is how to help people today grasp the justice of the atonement, given
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.360]   what they presently have as categories in their mind.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.080]   A word about that first issue.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.720]   My approach to biblical authority in relation to John Piper's fallen and fallible mind
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.040]   is to try, at least try, to let the Bible shape and even create categories of thought
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   in my mind.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.740]   In other words, if I come to the Bible and I find I don't have a category to make sense
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.200]   out of something, I want to try to let the Bible shape or create new categories.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.560]   The alternative, it seems to me, would be to insist that the Bible, God's word, whose
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.720]   ways are higher than my ways, be squeezed into my present ways of thinking.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.320]   I mean, it's just absurd.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.360]   It's absurd when I think about it.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.240]   All over the world, people are trying to squeeze the Bible, limit the Bible into their conceptuality
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.600]   that they inherited from their sinful culture and parents.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.160]   If people today are unwilling to have their way of thinking about the world changed, then
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.840]   either we will twist the Bible to fit our preconceptions or we will reject the Bible.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.400]   Because the Bible is resolute in insisting that Christ died in the place of sinners so
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.360]   that the justice of God is satisfied and sinners escape punishment.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.240]   So Galatians 3.13, Christ redeemed us from the curse, that's God's curse, the curse
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.440]   of the law, by becoming a curse for us.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.520]   It is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree."
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.240]   Or Isaiah 53.5, "He was pierced for our transgressions."
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   Our transgressions.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.060]   He pierced, we transgressed, he's pierced.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.920]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:15.280]   "Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his wounds we are healed.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree."
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   1 Peter 2.24.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   One more.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.760]   I love this one because it's the kind of image I expect for a Sunday school teacher
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.320]   to create and actually Paul created it.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:37.720]   God canceled the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.280]   This record of debt, he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.720]   In other words, when the spike was put against Jesus' hand, actually the spike was lifted
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.440]   up, a document was inserted between the spike and the hand called "Record of John Piper's
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.120]   and Tony Ranke's Debts" and it was driven through the record, into the hand, into the
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.000]   wood and that record was settled, paid, finished.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.640]   Now those are simply glorious truths and I grieve, I grieve that there are people who
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:27.760]   turn away from those truths as inconceivable or unjust, but I'm not surprised because
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.780]   Paul said Greeks see it as foolishness and Jews call it a stumbling block.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.060]   So we need grace to have our categories of thought adjusted by the Bible.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.760]   Now the second issue of how then do we try?
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.000]   That's what I want to do here for just a minute.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.120]   So let me make an effort to try to describe the justice of the atonement.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.680]   This is a little bit like trying to conceptualize the Trinity.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.520]   It's always risky because human conceptuality of divine things might be inadequate.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.120]   I mean, they are inadequate in that they're not comprehensive, but let's see if they
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.280]   can be true at least.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   So here goes.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.680]   The fundamental issue here is what does sin do to God and how is this set right?
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.080]   The most important answer is that sin dishonors God.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.980]   It detracts from his glory.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.020]   It belittles him.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:37.060]   It treats him as inferior in value to what we prefer in our sinful desire.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.480]   I think that's what sin is.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.880]   This is why the most important paragraph on the atonement in the Bible contains the words—this
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:55.200]   is Romans 3.23—"All have sinned and fall short or lack"—literally lack—"the
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   glory of God."
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:04.440]   In other words, sin is related to glory and it's related as losing glory, that is, exchanging
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.640]   the glory of God for images.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.400]   Chapter 1, verse 23.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.540]   It's an effort to rob God of his glory.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:18.120]   So the greatest problem in the universe is that God's creatures have gone on record
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.040]   as devaluing the glory of God.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:31.440]   It's as if the image of the Roman Caesar was ripped off the wall and trampled by mobs,
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.680]   and treason like that has always been a capital crime everywhere in the world.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:46.080]   Trampling the glory of the most glorious being is the most serious crime in the universe.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.120]   How then is this situation to be remedied justly?
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   How is justice to be done here?
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:01.680]   And the answer is that the injury done to the glory of God has to be repaired.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.360]   That's what justice is.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.040]   Justice is, or righteousness is, that the glory of God is to be restored to its rightful
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.760]   place of exaltation and admiration.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   This justice happens by stripping glory from the perpetrators in proportion to the way
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.320]   they have stripped it from God.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   That's the meaning of hell.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.360]   It will take an eternity to strip sufficient glory from finite creatures.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.480]   They don't have infinite glory, so it will take an infinite amount of time to balance
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:49.960]   the enormity of defacing the glory of an infinite being, and that punishment is therefore eternal.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:59.680]   And the question is, can Christ perform this repair of the glory of God for the people
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.720]   of God?
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.480]   And the answer of the Bible is yes.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:10.480]   And the reason is that Christ came precisely to vindicate the glory of God.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.400]   That's not true of any criminal on the planet who's in prison today.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.200]   That's why we can't do this kind of thing among men.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.840]   The reason Christ came is precisely to repair, to vindicate the glory of God.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.120]   Here's a glimpse of it in John 12, 27.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.560]   "Now is my soul troubled," Jesus said.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.800]   And what shall I say?
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.640]   "Father, save me from this hour," namely the hour of his death?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.640]   No.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.040]   "For this purpose I have come to this hour.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.320]   Father, glorify your name."
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.560]   Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again."
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.580]   This is the ultimate reason for the death of Jesus.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:00.720]   He came to repair the injury we had done to the glory of God.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   He laid aside his glory.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.520]   Philippians 2, he emptied himself, laid aside his glory.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:16.520]   He endured utter humiliation, not in a random way, but precisely for the glory of the Father.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:24.360]   Christ's whole incarnation was a reversal of our attack on the glory of God.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:32.080]   Since he's infinitely valuable, his loss of glory in his humiliation and death can
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:40.920]   cover all of our God-diminishing, God-dishonoring, God-defaming sins.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:48.720]   And therefore, complete justice can be done in justifying the ungodly, like us.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.920]   The glory of God is vindicated precisely in respect to the ways we have insulted the glory
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   of God.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:05.200]   Christ loses glory in suffering and dying precisely for the ways I have caused God to
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.080]   lose glory in my sins.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:15.240]   And so God is shown to be glorious in passing over my sins for the sake of Jesus, who lived
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.520]   and died to restore the glory of his Father.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.860]   And that's precisely what justice demands.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:33.960]   So oh, oh, how I hope God will open the eyes of those who think that the heart of the Bible,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.160]   the heart of the gospel, the best news in all the world is unjust.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:48.600]   It is in fact the highest expression of justice that ever was, and the greatest act of mercy.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   Amen.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.000]   There's endless glory in the cross.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.320]   And I can't let this episode end without mentioning your book, Pastor John, titled
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.760]   50 Reasons Why Jesus Came to Die.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.360]   We've only touched on some of those ways and all of these ways, these 50 reasons why Jesus
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.060]   came to die on the cross, we will celebrate for all of eternity.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.360]   You can download that book, 50 Reasons, and start reading it right now.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.400]   Go to DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.320]   We are now going to break for the weekend, and as we do from Pastor John and from myself
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.200]   and from the entire team of folks who serve you at Desiring God, we want to wish you all
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.720]   a very wonderful, joy-filled weekend reflecting on the death and resurrection of our precious

[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.280]   Amen.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   Amen.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   Amen.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   Amen.
