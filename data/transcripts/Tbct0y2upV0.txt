[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   We're honored to be joined again by author and speaker Paul Tripp on the Ask Pastor John
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280]   podcast.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.400]   He is the author of several books, including the book Sex and Money.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.040]   I have a bigger question for Christian leaders later, but first, Paul, we frequently receive
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.600]   heartbreaking emails from listeners of this podcast, specifically from wives who are feeling
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.760]   increasingly uncomfortable about the sexual expectations that their husbands bring into
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.200]   the bedroom.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.880]   Not all, but many of these women recognize this as the influence of pornography on the
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.240]   men, pushing husbands to expect increasingly lurid acts from their wives.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.640]   So what would you say to women in this situation and what would you say to the men as well?
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:55.440]   Well, it should never be the situation where a woman, after having sex with her husband,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.960]   feels put upon, feels demeaned, feels dirty, feels guilty, thinks that maybe she's done
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.240]   something that's not pleasing to God, walks away with shame.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.440]   Shame in marital sex is a screaming, flashing alarm because shame should not be part of
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.040]   marital sex.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.840]   It's the one place where sex isn't to be shameful.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.680]   Now if I have those shame feelings, it means that I have been forced to do things that
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.280]   I don't understand that my conscience is pushing against because the person who I'm having
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.240]   sex with is demanding rather than serving.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.720]   I mean, how could it be anything else?
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:57.520]   So I'm pushed to places that I'm not comfortable in and that is clearly what's going on there.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.640]   Now to the men, I would say this, I think that one of the lies of the cultural view
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.480]   of sex is that sex is all about titillation, that it's got to have that almost dark titillation
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.560]   to it or it's not exciting.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.240]   I'm going to say this and any honest married couple will say, I'm glad this man said this,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.160]   marital sex is not titillating.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.000]   It quits being titillating.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:37.560]   It becomes normal and regular and it's a regular expression of the love and the pleasure that
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.400]   God has given us in our relationship with one another.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.920]   The titillating thing is I've got to have more, I've got to do more, I've got to do
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.200]   more wild and weird things, I've got to do it in secret.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.720]   All that stuff I don't think is fundamentally what God meant sex to be.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   It's this regular expression of exciting physical love and pleasure between people who know
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.560]   themselves well and who are doing this together, who are seeking to please and to serve one
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:27.200]   another and they in the act feeling loved by God, loved by one another, satisfied and
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.320]   thankful, not guilty and shamed or mad because you wouldn't do what I want you to do.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.200]   This porn becomes pervasive, is this going to become a greater problem?
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   Here's what I would say about that, absolutely, but it's not first a pornography problem.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.000]   It's an ownership of my pleasure problem that makes pornography a problem.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.320]   If I own my pleasure, then I'm going to keep looking for things that give me more pleasure
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.760]   regardless of what it means to the other person.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.640]   So, if I get pleasure wrong, again, I weaken my defenses against pornography and the demandingness
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.720]   that I carry into the marital bed.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.760]   Okay, a follow-up question for leaders who want to be proactive in this.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.960]   Looking at this from a bigger context, I mean, the church seems to have a very strategic
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:27.280]   role in demythologizing sex, that is dethroning the cultural idol of sex, and then remythologizing
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.740]   sex, that is, you know, showing God's full intent for it.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.240]   How would you encourage pastors to do both of these things well?
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   Absolutely.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.960]   Well, I think that here's the state of things.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.280]   While the world, the culture around us never stops talking about sex, the church has been
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.440]   strangely quiet, strangely embarrassed, strangely reticent.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.760]   Sex is a pure gift that God has given us.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.400]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.380]   It points to God's holiness, his glory, his love, his faithfulness, his grace.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.240]   You could argue that the gift of sex preaches the gospel of who God is and what he does
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.680]   for his creatures.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.000]   So we don't have to be embarrassed about sex.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.520]   I would say this.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.580]   Sex belongs to the church.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.280]   It belongs to people who honor God, because it's only those people who are ever going
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.080]   to understand it properly and participate in it properly.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.680]   So we should not be silent.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.560]   We should celebrate human sexuality, because that celebrates the glory and the wisdom and
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.360]   the goodness of God.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:53.960]   And then what we need to do is teach people how to think in distinctively biblical ways
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   about sex.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.240]   And I think that's actually fairly simple.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.440]   It's the distinction I make in the Sex and Money book between big picture sex and little
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.480]   picture sex.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.600]   What the culture does is isolate sex as a thing unto itself.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.000]   Sex is sex, end of story.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.200]   It's not necessarily connected to anything but my pleasure.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.480]   That's heinously unbiblical view of sex.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.240]   Sex is connected to everything.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.440]   It's connected to the doctrine of creation.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.000]   God created sex.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   He owns sex.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.800]   It's connected to the authority of God.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.600]   God has the right to tell us what to do in sex.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.140]   It's connected to the nature of the fallen world and the surprise that this area gets
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.540]   distorted and bent and twisted.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.240]   It's connected to my relationship with people.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.240]   I'm called to love my neighbor as myself.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.040]   Sex is never an unrelational thing.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.800]   It's always about relationship.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   So there's all these cords that connect sex to bigger, larger things.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.760]   And when it's pulled by all those cords, it lives in the middle where it's supposed to
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   live.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.920]   And what we need to do is we need to connect all those cords for God's people in good preaching
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.080]   and good teaching.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.400]   Because once you understand that, it's impossible for you to think of sex in isolation anymore.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.080]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.440]   That's Paul Tripp, the author of the book Sex and Money.

[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440]   It's a very helpful book.
