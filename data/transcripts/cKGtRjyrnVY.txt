[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Well, if you watch international headlines, you know that vigilante killings are happening
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.720]   with some level of regularity in the Philippines.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.520]   Names of drug suspects are put on a list that's made by the government, and reportedly now
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.080]   over 1 million suspects are on that list.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.280]   And it's raising important questions about whether Christians in the country are complicit
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.000]   in the government's activity towards these suspects.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.440]   The question comes from a podcast listener named Hannah.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.800]   "Dear Pastor John, I'm a listener to the podcast in the Philippines.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.480]   I'm not sure what global news sources reveal about our current political situation, but
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.640]   there's plenty of local news about extrajudicial killings happening in our country, and a number
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.040]   of stories about young people being killed by policemen because they have supposedly
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.840]   been identified as drug dealers, though many witnesses reject those accusations.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.560]   These events have occurred and have become highly publicized since the President declared
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.980]   a war against drugs.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.000]   My intent is not to ask for a political commentary.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.640]   As a Christian, my concern is that many Christians here in the Philippines are supporters of
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.800]   our President and his agenda, and are thus perceived as supporters of this violent war
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.000]   against drugs and, by extension, implicit supporters of the killings.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.880]   Though it would not be fair to say that they approve of the killings outright, it does
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.400]   appear to us and other people who are against these political agendas that there seems to
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.720]   be a willful ignorance or a lack of discernment among these Christians who willingly declare
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.320]   their support for this leader without any qualification, and some who think that he
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.840]   has authority to do as he pleases so long as his methods solve the drug problem.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.600]   As a result, Christians here are starting to get a bad rap for being blind followers
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.800]   and supporters of the killings.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.520]   How can we respond in wisdom to these circumstances?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.600]   It's dangerous, of course, for me to speak too confidently about a situation so far from
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.400]   my own, but I do want to say something because I heard such an amazing analogy, at least,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.040]   between the situation in the Philippines and what we face in America.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.440]   I mean, it's really fresh on my front burner because of what I saw in the paper this morning.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.360]   There is a huge outcry here, throughout the nation really, about the number of people
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.100]   being killed by state officials who should not be killed.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.440]   Just a few miles from my house, Justine Daymond was killed a while back by police, no apparent
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   reason whatsoever.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   We've not, as far as I know, we've not been given any explanation that comes close
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.400]   to warranting what happened there.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.720]   And just yesterday, there was a meeting with the Hennepin County attorney and the neighborhood
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.120]   people and one of the neighborhood people, "Why is there this double standard between
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.880]   police and citizens while this police officer is walking around free?
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.560]   And if any citizen did that, they'd be sitting in jail right now waiting for trial."
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.040]   And you know what the Hennepin County attorney said?
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.880]   He said, "I don't have an answer for that because I haven't thought in those terms."
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   Wow.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.280]   Well, that's our issue.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   And the analogy of our two countries, while not exact, is enough to make me want to say
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640]   something anyway.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.160]   It sounds like your government is acting with a high hand in killing drug suspects without
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.200]   what we would call due process of law, and that some of the Church is either supportive
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.840]   or silent and therefore coming in for criticism for what appears to be complicity in such
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.480]   unjust practices, because we're supposed to be submissive to the government.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.200]   What can the Church do, we are asked here now in this question, what can we do to avoid
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.920]   that kind of tarnishing of Christ's reputation?
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.200]   So let me just say just four quick things.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.400]   One, God is more passionate for His glory and His reputation than we are, and He will
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.160]   not suffer it indefinitely to be scorned.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   Here's Isaiah 48.10, "Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.220]   I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.240]   For my own sake, for my own sake I do it.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.840]   How should my name be profaned?
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.280]   My glory I will not give to another."
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.980]   So take heart.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.720]   The vindication of God's name lies not mainly in our hands, but in God's, and He's more
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.540]   jealous for it than we are, so pray that He take action.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:56.720]   Number two, 1 Peter 2, verses 13 to 15, is extremely important in this regard because
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:06.080]   it gives us a warrant for prophetically confronting government with its acts of injustice.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.640]   Here's what it says, "Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.960]   be to the emperor as supreme or to governors as set by him," now notice these next two
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.760]   clauses, "set by him to punish those who do evil and praise those who do good."
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:36.720]   And then verse 15, "For this is the will of God that by doing good you should put to silence
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.400]   the ignorance of foolish people."
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:47.240]   So, yes, the disposition of a Christian should be to support, be submissive to governments,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.160]   local governments, national governments as part of God's will, but on the other hand,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.260]   we should, both in writing and in speaking and in conversation, and I would include preaching
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:09.220]   in all of this, we should publicly confront governors and presidents who do not punish
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:17.320]   evil and do not praise good, and in fact reverse the pattern and start participating in the
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.000]   very evil they are supposed to punish.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   The church has a warrant for prophetically denouncing such injustice.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:35.660]   So if we believe our president is acting in ways that do not confront evil but practice
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.460]   or participate in evil and do not support good but hinder good, we have a biblical warrant
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.920]   for publicly and prophetically denouncing those behaviors and policies.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:56.000]   Number three, I think the reputation of the local church in the neighborhood, a local
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.360]   church in the neighborhood, and the reputation of an individual Christian as a neighbor is
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:12.680]   more effective in evangelism than the public reputation of this amorphous thing called
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.720]   the Christian church.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:24.060]   If your local church is known for doing good, like 1 Peter 2:15 says, and you in particular
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.780]   are known by your colleagues at work, your fellow students, your neighbors, for being
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:37.800]   a gracious, kind, helpful, loving, sacrificial person, that is going to go much farther for
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.040]   the name of Christ among those with whom you live than anything they read in the press
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.880]   by way of criticism of the Christian church.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.880]   That's number three.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.720]   And here's number four.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:57.120]   The last thing I would say is that we must never think that public misrepresentations
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:06.480]   of the gospel, criticisms of the gospel, will necessarily stop the growth of the church.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:14.280]   A bad rap given to the church by the world won't stop God's purposes.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.880]   And the reason I say that is not only because of what I just said in number three, namely
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.840]   that personal reputations are more effective in evangelism than public perceptions, but
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:31.680]   also what Acts 28:22 says about the early church.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:38.760]   The situation is that Paul is addressing some Jewish people as he's in prison, and it's
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.840]   at the end of his life, and here's what they say.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   "We desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect, we know
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.320]   that everywhere it is spoken against."
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.600]   That's incredible.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:06.760]   We know that this Christianity that you came here promoting is a sect that is spoken against
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.920]   everywhere.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.680]   And we know another fact.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:19.360]   The church grew like wildfire for the first 300 years while it was being spoken against
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.400]   everywhere.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:29.840]   So woe to us if we get all crazy about thinking that the church has to have a good reputation
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.240]   in order to do what it's called to do.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.440]   We should care about the church's reputation.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:44.960]   But if some nominal believers are acting in unbiblical ways, and the press is making much
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.320]   of it, well, welcome to the first century, folks.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.240]   So don't lose heart.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.160]   Speak for the cause of truth and justice.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.320]   So speak, but mainly live.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:06.920]   Live among real flesh and blood people the way Christ would live, and you will do a great
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.360]   service for the reputation of Jesus.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   Amen.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.680]   And Hannah, thank you for the incredibly clear and articulate question that you sent in to
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.680]   us.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.640]   Questions like this one are really the key to what we do.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.560]   So please keep sending in those wonderfully worded, thoughtful questions.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.160]   And listeners are pretty important too.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.000]   So thank you for listening and making the podcast part of your week.

[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.960]   you may be facing about something you see in your country or city that makes you wonder
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.800]   how you should respond as a Christian.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   Send those emails in to us.

[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.960]   We are now going to break for the weekend, and when we return, we're going to look at
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.520]   Luke chapter 12, verses 47 and 48.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.440]   And we're going to see if the rather harsh words that Jesus speaks there are directed
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.640]   at non-Christians or are they directed at Christians.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.920]   That's next week on the podcast.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Monday.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.760]   God bless.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:15.780]   [End of Audio]
