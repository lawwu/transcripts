[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.200]   All right, next question.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.740]   Somebody asked, what's something you weren't prepared for, good or bad,
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.560]   that comes with the NBA lifestyle?
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.200]   People might not believe me on this, but I literally never played basketball with
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.440]   the thought of one day I'll be playing for a lot of money.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.080]   I always just play because I loved it and I wanted to be the best.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.700]   So I had no even concept of what it would be like to have money and
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.680]   to be able to take care of my family and to be able to do things I wanted to do.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.180]   I didn't know what it would be like to be able to go to dinner and spend $250,
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.120]   $300 on a bill and that would be okay.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.720]   Like I remember calling my mom like the first week when I got my first few checks
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.960]   or whatever, and I was like, wait, mom, so like I'm good to go, to go get,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.200]   like I'm good every day if I wanted to this week to go out to dinner and spend
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.000]   $200 and she was like, yeah, Michael, like that's okay.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.340]   And you know, my mom, like she's, she's still to this day wants me to be very frugal
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.000]   and whatever, but that wasn't even a concept in my head that I would have money
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.740]   to do, do stuff with.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.060]   Like I, for some reason there's like a misconception out there that I grew up with
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.920]   money or whatever, but like my, I'm in a family of 10.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.200]   My dad was the only one that worked and he made $30,000 a year.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.520]   And my mom was a stay at home mom homeschooling all of us.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.000]   Like my mom would pull up to Panera and wait to the end of the day so they could give her
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.120]   the leftover bagels that they were going to throw out.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.340]   So, but the thing is like, we never felt, we didn't feel like we were broke, but bro,
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.940]   we were broke.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.900]   Like my mom and dad did such a good job of making us feel like we had everything in the
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.760]   world and everything we needed, but we were broke.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480]   $30,000 a year for 10 kids.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.340]   Like, I don't know where that misconception comes from that I grew up like with, with bread,
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.240]   but that was my biggest thing that I didn't really prepare for was the fact that I'm gonna
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.880]   have money, I'm gonna be able to take care of my mom and dad, I'm gonna be able to buy
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.460]   them a car.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.040]   I'm gonna be able to go to dinner when I want and not worry about the bills.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.840]   So that was, that was like obviously a good surprise.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.400]   And then, you know, something that's kind of a bad, a bad thing that I didn't really prepare
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.300]   for was kind of the loneliness.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.120]   You feel a little bit, um, just through the process of the season, all the traveling, all
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.100]   the nights in the hotel alone, all the, all the, um, it is isolating.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.100]   Like you do feel very isolated, especially probably when you don't have a significant
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.440]   other and you don't have somebody who's traveling with you on the road.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.000]   Like most of my friends at this point are married and got kids.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.100]   Even my two younger brothers, they're married.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.360]   My sisters are married, got kids.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.600]   So besides you, I never had anybody like pulling up on me.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.440]   Uh, you know, I don't, I don't have a lot of friends.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.140]   So I feel like the isolating fact of that can be kind of tough.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.280]   I would say that I would say the fact, I would even add to that, bro, because your
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.940]   experience is different because you had three surgeries and you're having surgeries in the
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.340]   midst of the NBA season.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.940]   So like sometimes where you have that brotherhood, you're traveling with your teammates, you have
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.660]   them, you're staying back in Denver because you're doing rehab or we're in Dallas because
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.600]   we're at Dr.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.460]   Doss's office and you're having surgery.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.740]   So even within, you know, most people have their teammates to lean on.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.840]   Sometimes you didn't even have that at moments.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.520]   And I think also the fact that I was homeschooled growing up, I didn't make a lot of
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.540]   relationships growing up.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.680]   I got a few homies that are still my friends to this day, but like, I think that's
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.780]   another thing is I just never was a dude that had a lot of friends.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.660]   I had my family and that was, that was really all I needed.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.420]   So I think the isolating fact about the NBA would, would probably be the thing that I
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.580]   didn't prepare for.
