[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   [Music]
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.760]   Our first question comes from Usman, who asks, "Any advice for people who are studying while
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.040]   working in a warehouse for 40 hours a week?" A little bit of an elaboration here. I work in a
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.680]   warehouse job four days a week and 10 hours a day with two 30-minute breaks. I am currently studying
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.960]   an online course about computer science. When I finish work, I am physically exhausted and my feet
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.640]   ache. I have most of your books, including How to Become a Straight A Student, and it's very helpful.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.600]   Do you have any more advice for people who are working full-time and want to study?" Well, that's
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.040]   a good question. You know, a group I hear a very similar question from a lot is actually
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.120]   practicing doctors. They have similar types of shifts where it's not every day, but the shifts
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.960]   are longer. They also often have some sort of concentration bearing non-urgent but important
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.200]   activities, studying for new certification, or they're working on a writing project. So,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.200]   doctor or research, they're doing a research project on the side. So, I've heard the same
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.960]   question from them a lot as well. Usually what I would say there, which I think holds here as well,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.040]   if you're doing a 10-hour shift in a day, regardless of whether this is you're on your
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.440]   feet seeing patients or working in a warehouse, it's going to be hard to do meaningful, high
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:29.520]   concentration studying on a regular basis after such days. You should recognize that this is
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.280]   really demanding what you're doing, and not be down on yourself that you then find it hard
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.040]   after that 10 hours to get after it with an online computer science course. So, I'm going to
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.680]   tell you that's the same thing I tell doctors when they do these long shifts. They often do 10-hour
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.000]   shifts or 12-hour shifts. You're not going to really get good progress done on your research
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.600]   project if you've done a 12-hour shift at the hospital. So, you might have to slow down the
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.000]   pace at which you're working on things so that when you work on it, you can work on it well.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.840]   You should also pump up the intensity when you do work on it. Remember, the core formula in how to
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.800]   become a straight-A student is work accomplished is time spent times intensity of focus.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.360]   So, if you're working four days, you might want to take two out of the three days that remain.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.080]   Those are two days on which you're going to have a non-trivial amount of studying,
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.880]   and that studying is going to be laser beam locked in high-intensity focus.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   You have two medium-length sessions per week with incredible focus, according to that equation,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.520]   can accomplish as much work as slightly smaller but also much less focused
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.040]   sessions at the end of multiple 10-hour work days. So, work less, do the work you do with
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.120]   extreme intensity of focus, and therefore, do that work on the days where you actually have
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.240]   those resources to invest. Now, I will note, you noticed that you noted that you had read
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.680]   How to Become a Straight-A Student. An interesting tidbit about that book. So, I wrote that book,
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.920]   and I mentioned on the show a couple weeks ago that I hadn't looked at sales numbers for that
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800]   for a really long time. I looked up the royalties last month and was surprised to see that thing has
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.040]   sold 300,000 copies, which is a lot for a non-fiction book. And it has done that without
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.440]   ever having major publicity, without ever being on a bestseller list, without ever really being
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.960]   mentioned by anyone well-known. It's all just chugging in the background, word of mouth,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.760]   over 15 years. What I discovered about that book is that its number one audience is not
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.560]   full-time undergraduates at expensive four-year universities. In fact, those are the students,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.160]   the students that my entire adult life I have been surrounded at, at MIT, at Dartmouth, at
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.240]   Georgetown. Those type of students often don't want anything to do with that. They have their
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.680]   college experiences wrapped up with their presentation of self. They have this idea of
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.600]   college years being a time of expression, and as you grow into adulthood, and it has,
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.880]   there's an academic component, but a social component, and a loss of inhibition component,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.960]   and they don't want to have anything to do with Cal Newport, seven steps for managing your time.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.840]   The number one audience for that book was non-traditional college students.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.360]   So a lot of people returning to college later in life. I used to do a lot of work with vets
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.160]   on the GI Bill. So you're coming back to college after military stint, you're coming back on the
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.640]   GI Bill, you should do some work with the Warrior Scholar Project. First-generation students as
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.040]   well. I've worked with multiple different first-generation student, usually scholarship
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.440]   funds, where they're helping students that are their first in their generation or in their
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.560]   family to go to college. So a lot of community college I've worked with as well, because all
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.000]   of these non-traditional students are much more likely to say, "Here's a challenge, I want to do
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.320]   well here. What's some advice? Great, here's some advice, let's go." It's like, I'm working in a
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.080]   warehouse trying to get this job, trying to get this course done. I don't have an animal house
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.840]   fantasy where if I'm not wearing a toga at least two days a week, I'm somehow not properly enjoying
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.920]   my 20s. I need to get this course done, give me advice. And so that's been the number one audience
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.400]   for that book, is actually it's not for your students. So anyways, hearing your question made
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.360]   me think about it. I'm not surprised you're looking at the book. I'm not surprised you're
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.920]   getting value out of it. But that is my advice. Don't work on your warehouse days, work on your
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.800]   higher energy days, but then turn that intensity focus knob all the way up. And you'll be surprised
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:42.400]   by how little time you actually need to get this done.
