[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   - Hi, next question is from Jim.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.760]   How do you know if a big, slow productivity idea
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.080]   is good enough to warrant the daily effort?
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.360]   Background, I'm a full-time online writer
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.920]   and I have a book idea.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.160]   I think that I might find an audience,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.020]   but I don't know if it will work.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.720]   - Well, this is very important.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.720]   Jim, we talked about this with the final law of less
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.280]   during the deep dive,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.220]   but this gives us a specific case study to tackle.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.680]   So let's go back and remember what I said
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.000]   in that fifth law of less,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880]   and we'll apply it to your particular situation
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.960]   about working on a book idea.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.440]   So first of all, you're going to want to work up
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.040]   to bigger size projects.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.840]   You might not wanna start right away
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.200]   with just I am writing a book, right?
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.680]   What is actually happening here is, okay, can I write?
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.400]   Have I actually published some writing before?
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   All right, that's a step.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.140]   Do I have an agent?
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.540]   Well, that's gonna be another first step.
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.960]   If I can get an agent, that's gonna be a justification
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.020]   or validation that my idea is good.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.460]   There's someone else who's a professional
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.020]   who thinks I'm the right person to write it.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.020]   So let me make that the next step.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.120]   Now I got that done.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.400]   Now I feel a little bit more confident.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.580]   Now I'm writing sample chapters for the proposal.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.420]   I can write two sample chapters.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.180]   That's hard, but that's more tractable.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.700]   My agent likes these sample chapters.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.240]   Oh, now we've sold the book.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.420]   Now we've actually can go,
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.880]   now when I'm going ahead and writing this book,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.180]   I've done some writing, I've gotten an agent,
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.380]   I've written some sample chapters.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.460]   Those sample chapters convinced the publisher.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.580]   Now you're gonna find motivation to finish this book.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.900]   This is all very different than just saying,
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.280]   let me just start writing.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.900]   I think I could produce something really good.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.480]   The executive functioning center of your brain
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.680]   is gonna look at that plan and says, says who?
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.140]   How do you know that anything,
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780]   that this at all is gonna turn up?
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.740]   We have no evidence.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.700]   We have no background experience
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.820]   with just writing every day
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.300]   and it turns out producing a book.
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.660]   So I would say you really wanna ladder your way up
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.660]   to this bigger, longer project.
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.180]   Now the foundation to what I'm talking about here
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.300]   that sort of underscores all of this
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.780]   is to be ruthlessly evidence-based
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.320]   and figuring out your plan
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.080]   for the thing you want to accomplish.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.760]   So again, I'm really worried when I hear about,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.180]   for example, a writer saying,
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.580]   yeah, I'm just gonna start writing every day
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.700]   because that tells me you haven't talked to someone
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.820]   in the publishing industry.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.600]   You don't understand how the publishing industry works
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.420]   or you do understand and you reject it.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.100]   You're nervous about talking to an agent
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.380]   'cause they might not like your book idea.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.460]   So you're gonna have the circuitous approach
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.860]   where well, write it myself
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.580]   but then I'll be very clever about the marketing
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.500]   and we'll do this and that
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.860]   and then the agents will come to me later
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.980]   and wanna buy my book.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.840]   You're inventing your own story
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.860]   about how the industry works
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.460]   because you either don't know or you don't like
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.580]   or you're afraid of what the actual story really is.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.900]   You have to be ruthlessly evidence-based
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.540]   when coming up with what you're gonna work on
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.540]   and how you're gonna work on it
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.480]   for one of these diligent, disciplined,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.120]   long-term project endeavors
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.620]   because it's a really big investment of time.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.120]   Your brain has to trust.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.700]   You know what you're doing
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.260]   and this has a chance of succeeding.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.260]   So do not skip the step of ruthlessly gathering evidence
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.560]   about how your field actually works.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.520]   Now, I see this all the time.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.160]   There's a lot of other common examples
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.320]   where people will write their own stories
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.460]   instead of actually figuring out how a field works.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.960]   This happens in tech startups a lot.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.200]   I talk to people that like the idea
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.120]   of having a technology startup
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.960]   but don't actually want to talk to,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.600]   let's say, funders or investors
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.640]   or get a sense of what would make a company attractive
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.480]   to an investor that would allow an exit,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.120]   that would allow growth or acquisition.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.300]   They don't want those stories.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.360]   They want it just to be the fun stuff
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.920]   that I have a Slack account set up
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.880]   and I'm jumping on calls with people
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.680]   to get their ideas about things
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.580]   and paying web developers to set up a website.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.260]   They don't want the reality
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.200]   of what is the technical skill required?
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.520]   What is the work that actually goes into producing something
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.800]   that is good enough that has the potential scalability
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.940]   that can actually attract funding?
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.580]   How much talent does that actually require?
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.060]   I don't know how many times I've heard someone say,
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.160]   "Yeah, I just need to find a programmer type
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.840]   "to build the thing, but I've got this great idea."
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.600]   They want just the fun part, not the hard part.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.660]   And there's other fields too
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.840]   where you'll see the same thing.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.680]   You'll see it in podcasting.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.520]   But what actually, talk to a successful podcaster.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.900]   How does a podcast become financially viable?
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.600]   It's rare.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.640]   So what are the elements
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.340]   that makes a podcast financially viable?
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.360]   How do you, what is required to actually get there?
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.240]   What type of audience or content
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.920]   and what differentiates a successful one
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.760]   from a non-successful one?
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.840]   People don't want to hear that too.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.460]   They just say, "I just want to start recording
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.480]   "because you never know, maybe I'll be Joe Rogan."
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.720]   Even though that's not how it actually happens.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.100]   So ruthlessly evidence-based approach
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.640]   to these big ambitious projects,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.800]   it sounds at first like a downer,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.220]   but it is the fuel that will allow you
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.560]   to actually continue and get something big done.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.000]   The bad news is,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.240]   it might take a lot of things off the table at first.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.760]   Things that you want to do for your big projects,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.360]   you gather the evidence and you realize,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.020]   "I'm not in a good position to do this."
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.860]   And that is a downer.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.660]   But what it does mean, and this is the side, the benefit,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.180]   when you do find a thing that is reasonable for you to pursue
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.040]   that feeling of motivation you have,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.240]   when the evidence is there to back it up,
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.480]   you've built your way up to this,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.400]   your mind believes that that feeling of motivation
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.280]   is really powerful,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.680]   and a lot of people don't even recognize it
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.520]   until they get it.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.600]   And then they say, "Oh, this is what it feels like
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.000]   "to go after something big
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.360]   "in a way that is deeply grounded in reality
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.480]   "and has a real chance of succeeding."
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.880]   It just feels very different than the,
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.860]   "I'm writing every day, I'm doing my thousand words,
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.260]   "I'm having Zooms with people about my startup idea,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.840]   "I bought a USB mic and now I'm a podcaster."
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.600]   It really feels different once you have that foundation
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360]   of evidence.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.920]   So I'm glad you brought this up, Jim,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.600]   because I think that's, it's downplayed too much
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.880]   when we talk about these big, ambitious, long-term projects.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.680]   All the prep work is often ignored,
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.120]   and we just say, "Well, have the courage
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.520]   "to follow your passion and just go for it."
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.480]   No, don't go for it, until you're so convinced
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.280]   that you'd be dumb not to that you have no other choice.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.080]   All right, Jesse, I don't know, Jesse,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.980]   I kind of feel now like I'm temporarily back
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.360]   in that beginner podcast phase.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.080]   I have a USB microphone, I'm in a basement,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.240]   I'm not in the HQ, I feel like we're taking steps
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.160]   backwards here, though actually, I think,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.120]   this is what's gonna be fun, I think listeners
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.000]   are gonna see and viewers are gonna see,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.720]   I'm slowly going to evolve my setup here
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.280]   as the summer goes on, because I flew up here
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.160]   and I'm flying back to drive up with my family,
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.120]   so I'm gonna be bringing more equipment up
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.880]   in a couple weeks, nice cameras, some nice lighting.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   My goal is by the time we get to mid-August,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.280]   that this house here at Hanover is gonna be producing
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.460]   a really slick looking podcast.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.320]   I think it's gonna be a fun project.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.080]   I'm gonna build a cool setup here.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.400]   It really will be the Deep Work HQ North once I'm done.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.040]   So that'll be a fun progression to watch
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.880]   as the summer unfolds.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   Yeah, baby.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.860]   (upbeat music)
