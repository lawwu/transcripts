[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   So, let's use for today's Deep Question the following, "What happens when you cut your
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:14.840]   work day in half?"
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.120]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, the show about living and working deeply in
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.680]   a distracted world.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.120]   So I'm joining you once again from the Deep Work HQ North up in Hanover, New Hampshire,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.800]   joined by my producer, Jesse, who is down south in our DC version of the HQ.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.280]   Jesse, how's it going down there?
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.800]   It's going well.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.360]   It's good to be here.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.520]   I'm excited about your comment last week about the new desk that you want to put in the office.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.160]   Yes, yes.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.040]   I am looking forward to my vision of a custom-built three-wall wraparound desk.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.040]   It's great to daydream.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.400]   I'm actually podcasting right now.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.200]   You can't see it from the camera because the camera is just on me.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800]   You just see a wood panel background behind me.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.720]   But I'm actually podcasting right now from, I guess I would describe it as a conference
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.120]   room.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.360]   So the house in which I'm staying that this fellowship program put me up on has a walkout
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.720]   basement conference room where they really do run conferences down here and other types
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.840]   of events.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   And I'm facing three massive arched paned windows, probably 10 feet tall that are looking
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.240]   out over Ockham Pond beyond this.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.720]   But I'm at a table that must be, it made me think about our desk, I don't know, 15 feet
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.600]   long, a giant solid wood conference table that I'm sitting at right now.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.040]   So maybe this is what got me thinking about our solid built-in desk in the HQ.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.080]   It's a big sturdy piece of wood.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.480]   I feel like a diplomatic negotiation is happening every time I sit down here, the podcast.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480]   So I like it.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.360]   Big solid, big solid piece of wood.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.920]   And I will say, here's the danger of today's podcast, not to open the curtain a little
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.700]   bit, but we're recording this one a full week in advance.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.600]   So this is coming right after the weekend of the 22nd and the 23rd.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.400]   I'm very tempted, Jesse, to talk just watching Nationals baseball.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.320]   We had our first series sweep since 2021 against a playoff contending Giants.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.240]   I think we could fill an entire episode easy with trade deadline discussion.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.160]   So let me just say, everyone out of the audience should be thankful that I am resisting my
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:55.600]   urge right now to go really deep on the controllability of Lane Thomas or Kandee's third base defensive
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.040]   run scored or whether or not CJ Abrams is going to break one war on the season, which
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.600]   I think he definitely will.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.360]   All of the instincts in my body, Jesse, are saying, do not go serious on baseball.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.960]   But I'm in a good mood because the baseball team has been playing well recently.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.360]   Yeah, really good series win for them.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.920]   Yeah, yeah, can't go wrong.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   Can't go wrong.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.680]   I still have not succeeded in convincing either the Lerner family or Mike Rizzo that they
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.800]   need deep work taught to their players to really get to the next level.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.160]   And the right way to teach this is to have the person who wrote the book be in the club
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.520]   box because you see, you need me there, I think, to really get a feel for it.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.720]   You need me in the club box, probably in the clubhouse, let's be honest, so I can really
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.680]   get a sense of what's going on there.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   So again, my call goes out, you really need me in the clubhouse for the team to get to
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   the next level.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.440]   I mean, I think honestly, me being there on game day is like a three win above replacement
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440]   bump.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.920]   I'm a three war player.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.160]   Okay, that's enough of this, Jesse, we're gonna lose all of our listeners.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.120]   Speaking of our listeners, though, one thing I've noticed, and I don't know if you've seen
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.900]   the same thing, but it seems to me the links and ideas that people have been sending to
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.540]   us at interesting@calnewport.com have been unusually good recently.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.640]   I'm getting lots of really interesting articles and links and case studies that people are
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   sending to me.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's really kept me rich in ideas to think about.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.760]   And it's actually something that someone sent to me recently that I want to make the focus
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.280]   of our deep dive today.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.080]   It's an article from friend of the show, Oliver Berkman's newsletter.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.800]   So Oliver Berkman is a columnist and writer from the UK.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.240]   He wrote most recently 40,000, is it weeks?
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.280]   I always get it wrong, 40,000 weeks, which is his time management for mortals.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.360]   So it's this very popular book, rethinking time management about we only have so much
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.760]   time you're not gonna be able to do most things you want to do.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   Now what?
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.680]   And it really hit a chord.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.720]   There is vibes of slow productivity in there.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.280]   There is vibes of Jenny O'Dell in there.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.600]   I think it really hit a chord and it's done very well.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.720]   The paperback version is coming out in the US right around now.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.560]   So certainly check that out if you haven't bought it yet.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.780]   But anyways, he has a newsletter called The Imperfectionist.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.300]   And he wrote recently about an experiment he conducted with his own time management
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.360]   where he dealt with feeling overloaded by actually drastically cutting back how much
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.360]   he worked.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.720]   So it's an experiment that really touches on the fixed schedule productivity strategy
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.260]   we talked about recently and the slow productivity philosophy more generally.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.760]   And I thought what we would do is let's go through it.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.480]   I want to go through his newsletter and react to certain pieces about why he did it and
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.360]   what he learned because I think there is some lessons we can identify in that as well.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.280]   We'll now just set up the experiment that Oliver decided to conduct.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.320]   So he said, "Something I've long understood about myself is that whenever I get stressed
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.120]   about the number of things on my plate or anxious about the challenges of a specific
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.480]   project, it's an excellent idea to do the opposite of what comes naturally to me."
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.640]   So scrolling down here he says, "And so recently when I felt myself on the brink of overwhelm,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.840]   I thought I'd try pushing this principle one step further.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.120]   It had started to feel as though even 20-hour workdays would be insufficient, frankly, to
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.920]   get a handle on my to-do list.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:41.320]   So what if I were to deliberately limit myself to a preposterous, clearly insufficient four-hour
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320]   workday instead?"
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.660]   All right, so that's our setup.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.520]   He was feeling overwhelmed and said, "I'm going to run this experiment.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.440]   What if I do the opposite of my instincts?"
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.920]   I want to point out here before we even get farther into Oliver's particular experience,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.440]   as I've talked about on the show, I did something similar, though for different reasons, during
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.480]   my years as a postdoctoral associate at MIT.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.680]   Now I wasn't feeling overwhelmed.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.400]   I actually had the opposite problem, which is I felt as if I didn't have enough work
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.920]   to do, which is very common for a postdoctoral position, especially in theoretical computer
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   science.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.240]   And since, in part, those positions are a holding pattern while you go out to do your
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.700]   academic interviews to try to get an academic job.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.480]   And also you just don't have classes, you don't have a dissertation to work on, your
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   research is mature.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   So typically you are just continuing research projects that you already started but haven't
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   yet finished.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.140]   You want to get those finished in time to go on the academic job market.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.680]   So you can feel, especially in theory, a real drop in your time obligations.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.360]   And I got really worried at that point because I knew that that was going to shift dramatically
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.760]   in the other direction when I became a professor.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.600]   Professors have a lot more on their plate.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.000]   You have to teach classes, you have to research, you have to supervise students, you have to
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.480]   find grant funding, you have to do service.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.120]   And so I did something similar to Oliver when I was a postdoc.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.800]   I slashed my working hours down because I wanted to get used to working on my research
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.320]   in a much smaller amount of time because I knew that was the only amount of time I would
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.240]   actually have available once I became a professor.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.120]   So I'm familiar with this setup, but I came at it from the exact opposite angle.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.480]   I came at it from when I was not busy enough.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.400]   Oliver is trying this when he was too busy, which I think is interesting.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.600]   All right, so let's keep reading here to see what happens.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   So let's go on here.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.400]   All right, he's very clear about this.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.360]   I'm not talking about the three to four hour rule for getting creative work done.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.800]   Now, as an aside, Oliver has this principle of, you know, work on something creative for
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.960]   three hours, maybe four, and then stop.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.860]   That's about how much time you can make progress on something creative.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.680]   But what he's emphasizing here is this is more than this.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.500]   He said, no, this was more of a shock tactic.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.800]   Just for a while, I dedicate no more than four hours to any kind of work.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.640]   So this was not just about work deeply for three hours and don't do any more.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.040]   He's going to do no work after four hours.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.080]   So he said he was going to then make myself stop and use the extra time to do fun things
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.080]   instead.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.220]   Not that I expected them to feel fun.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.500]   I expected to find it seriously uncomfortable to walk away from work like this.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.740]   And reader, it was.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.540]   He then goes on to give the caveats.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.100]   He says, look, here's the obvious caveat.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.780]   I'm well aware of an unusual degree of autonomy over how I portion my time.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:37.540]   This specific experiment won't be feasible for many, though there's a caveat to the caveat.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.380]   It's worth asking if you might have more autonomy than you realize.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.380]   I do think that is a important caveat to the caveat.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.700]   He's saying, yeah, of course, I'm a writer.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.900]   I can do this.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.140]   A lot of people can't do this.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.020]   But do keep in mind, you might have more autonomy over time than you think.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:59.020]   And really, the spirit of this experiment is reducing artificially your work hours to
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.020]   see what happens.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.700]   Not that you specifically maybe reduce it to exactly this many hours or exactly the
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.700]   way he did it.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.180]   OK, that's the setup.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.420]   He's overwhelmed.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.320]   Four hours, then he has to go try to do fun things.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.980]   He had three observations, three observations that came out of this experiment.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.060]   So let's go through these one by one, and I'll give you my take.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.500]   All right, so the first-- I'll load it up on the screen here for those who are watching.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.740]   The first thing he noticed.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.480]   Just by making the activity a smaller part of your day, you'll find yourself looking
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.400]   forward to it more.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.720]   It shifts from being something you have to do for hour after hour to something you get
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.220]   to do.
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.660]   This chimes with the research of the psychologist Robert Boyce, quoted in 4,000 Weeks, who found
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.460]   that the most productive writers were those who made writing only a modest part of their
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.740]   schedules rather than letting it dominate.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:58.500]   Motivated to return to it day after day, they produced more output over the long haul.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.700]   All right, so this is a classic slow productivity principle right here.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.580]   So he's saying when it comes to the deep stuff you do, when it comes to the skilled stuff
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.500]   you do, putting a limit on your time is not bad.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.420]   You do better work when you actually work, you look forward to it more, and over time
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:20.780]   this quality output is going to aggregate into a quality final product.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.620]   So this is classic slow productivity for high-quality efforts.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:31.460]   Slow but steady is how people produce masterpieces, not in frenzied bursts of activity.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.220]   So I think that's important, but what we're missing is what about all the other stuff
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.420]   you have to do?
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.540]   It's not all just sitting there and writing.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.740]   So let's keep going, get his second of three observations.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.940]   All right, second.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:52.540]   There's a palpable shift in your experience of agency, of being in charge of your life.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.740]   It's easy for a major project or a long to-do list to start to feel like an angry god you
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.100]   must ceaselessly placate, and that the best you can hope for by the time evening rolls
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.660]   around is to have held it at bay for one more day.
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.620]   Even on the days you manage that, it's a horribly oppressive way to live.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.140]   Radically restricting your hours flips this picture completely.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.140]   Merely by deciding on strict limits, you're putting yourself in the driver's seat, which
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.380]   brings a totally different energy to the situation.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.020]   Now instead of resentfully grinding away or procrastinating in a stubborn attempt to defy
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.420]   your oppressor, you're choosing to dedicate time to the task.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.900]   And four hours spent in this manner, I can attest, is vastly more effective than eight
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.740]   hours spent in the other way.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.340]   Well here I think is an insight that is new to me and I think is a smart one.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.780]   The psychology of your workload.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:45.700]   Personifying your workload as an enemy against which you are essentially doing battle.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.220]   So by saying, "I am going to not just stop working when I'm just so exhausted it becomes
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.660]   impractical to do anything else," because that's the workload monster winning.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.700]   Say, "I'm going to choose when I work and it's going to be less than that."
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.020]   And now you feel like you're in charge.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.900]   And Berkman is pointing out, when you feel like you're in charge, like you have autonomy,
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.860]   you bring a fresh energy to that work.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.460]   It's something you're choosing to do.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.460]   You are going to feel more motivated about how you work.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.780]   Now look, I've seen something similar to this back when I used to work with college students.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.060]   When I would find college students, especially at elite schools, begin to have massive procrastination
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.420]   problems, almost always what was going on was a short-circuiting of their motivational
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.420]   system.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.100]   They're grinding, grinding, grinding.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.820]   Especially if the work was for classes, they didn't even sure why they were taking them.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.860]   It was because they were pre-med, because their parents said they should be a doctor.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.220]   They're grinding, grinding, grinding.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.980]   What would eventually happen is their motivational system would fry out.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.420]   When their system fried out, they couldn't do any more work.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.980]   Berkman gives us an interesting insight into understanding what's going on there.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.320]   In some sense, it is your oppressor finally just crushes your spirit.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.140]   So simply by saying, "I have control.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.860]   I'm going to work a lot, but on my terms, and not as much as I might otherwise do,"
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.300]   you feel like you're doing this on your own motivation.
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.020]   That this is intrinsic instead of extrinsic motivation, and that's much less likely to
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.460]   fry your motivational system.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.780]   You're much less likely to burn out.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.780]   So I think that's a really insightful way of looking at it.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.240]   By working less, you actually feel better about your work, and again, the results you
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.820]   produce might therefore end up not being less than if you had tried to put in more hours,
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.740]   something that he keeps coming back to again and again.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.780]   We got one last conclusion from Oliver here.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:37.740]   "Finally, you learned a crucial lesson that the sky doesn't fall in when things get neglected.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:44.380]   We 'insecure overachievers' drive ourselves so hard thanks to an unconscious sense that
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.020]   if we don't, some catastrophe will occur.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.920]   And look, it's really good to meet deadlines, keep commitments, answer messages promptly,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.940]   and so on, but for almost everyone in almost every context, it isn't actually essential
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.540]   in this existential life-or-death sense to do so.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.860]   When you put a hard limit on your work hours, it's inevitable that on any given day, you'll
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.240]   fail to do everything you think needs to get done.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.300]   In fact, that's true whether you limit your hours or not.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.500]   The limit just makes it impossible to ignore.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.940]   And what happens?
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.820]   The world doesn't end, which is liberating because it allows you to accept your finite
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.940]   capacities rather than living in fear of them, and because you get to spend less of
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.980]   your work time feeling like you're forestalling catastrophe and more of it making a calm,
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.140]   empowered choice about what would be wisest to prioritize.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:36.580]   The miraculous result, once more, is that you end up neglecting less of what truly matters."
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.080]   So I think again, we have some interesting psychology being brought up here.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.160]   So he has this term "insecure overachievers" for this idea that I have to keep working
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.600]   because if I neglect something, it's going to be a problem.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.620]   People are counting on me, they need this to get done.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.780]   And so you push yourself longer hours to try to each night get to this place of, "Okay,
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.700]   I think I've taken care of every open loop."
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.460]   We see this a lot in inbox insecurity.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.700]   This idea that if there's an email in that inbox from someone I work with that needs
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.080]   something, that's a problem.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.020]   And so I got to empty out this inbox, I got to answer all these messages, and I have to
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.820]   keep checking even after the workday is over because it makes me really stressed that there's
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.340]   a message in there waiting for me.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.300]   You see this a lot when you have interactions with people who are maybe new to knowledge
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:31.040]   work or aren't as inculcated in a world of knowledge work, and you will see this sort
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.420]   of desperate quick responses to your messages that are almost always apologetic, and it's
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.900]   because they're still conceptualizing this communication like they would an in-person
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.900]   interaction.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.660]   "Oh my God, it's rude to ignore someone.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.260]   Every minute I have not answered this message is a problem.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.900]   That's a minute where that person is just sitting there seething.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.900]   Where is my response?"
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:56.540]   So you see this inbox insecurity as a concrete instantiation of insecure overachievement.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:02.260]   I actually have a—I come to a similar issue sometimes from a different direction.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.700]   So I have this weird worry where I'll think, "Okay, I have these various things that I
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.840]   need to get done.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.900]   What if I am sick tomorrow, or what if equivalently I don't sleep well?
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.200]   I'm going to have a hard time getting some of these things done.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.300]   So if I can actually get this all done today, even if I have to push really hard and skip
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:29.100]   a meal, I will get some relief knowing that tomorrow I'm not dependent on feeling good.
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.040]   I'm not dependent at being at my full power."
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.180]   This of course is another Sisyphean mindset because there's always another day.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.180]   There's always more work to be done.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.180]   Days are short.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.180]   Days are long.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.260]   It's much better to say, "Let's just take each day as it comes and does a reasonable
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.220]   amount of work, and there'll be good days and bad days, but overall things will get
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.220]   built up."
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.180]   But it's very easy for me to think at the moment, "If I could make tomorrow easier
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.820]   by working harder today, I'm going to get some relief."
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:58.100]   And of course I get to tomorrow and then say, "Well, if I could make today harder to make
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.700]   the next day easier, then I'm going to get some relief."
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.620]   And the reason why you never catch up of course is that there's always more work you can pull
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.620]   in.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.220]   There's always someone else with a message you could get back to.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.020]   There's always another project you could initiate.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:16.220]   So I think these subtle psychologies of overwork are all very interesting.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.740]   There is now that we're stepping back, okay, so we're stepping back from Oliver's article.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.260]   There is an overlay I want to add onto this that he doesn't talk about, but we talk about
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.700]   a lot on this show, and I think it is really critical, and that is the overlay of workload
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.140]   management.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.660]   So a lot of what happens when you add, let's say, a four-hour workday, right?
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.820]   So you're adding an artificial limit.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.380]   The reason why that works, like the reason why you don't, in Oliver's case, end up spiraling
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.860]   out of control, the reason why you don't end up with people constantly irate at you and
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:53.300]   on the phone is because all work limits, be it the eight-hour workday, a ten-hour workday,
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.100]   a four-hour workday, they're all artificial.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.820]   They're all just lines in the sand of, "This is how much time I have to work, and I stop
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.500]   working after this time is over."
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.480]   In almost every non-entry-level knowledge work job, there is way more available tasks
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.780]   than you'll ever have time to do, so you're always at some point drawing a line and saying,
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.900]   "No more after this."
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.020]   This is why Oliver finds that his whole thing doesn't fall apart, because we're already
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.580]   implicitly doing this all the time when we stop working at six, or when we stop working
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.220]   at seven, or when we decide, for example, that we're not going to work until 4 a.m.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.220]   every morning.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.220]   And all of this is possible.
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:37.700]   Now, by the way, I do have a friend who does this, who will work to 3 or 4 a.m. most days.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.020]   You might say, "Well, wait, if I'm working until 7 p.m., there's no more time to work.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.020]   That's filling my whole time."
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.100]   No, you could be working many hours after that.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.600]   It's all kind of artificial where we draw these lines.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.780]   What happens is when we draw these lines is that becomes our implicit workload management
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.860]   system.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.900]   This is how much time I have.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.560]   If I have way more work than I can actually stay on top of in this much time, that's back
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.560]   pressure.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.660]   And that back pressure says, "I'm going to say no to more things.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.540]   I'm going to take some more things off of my plate.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.660]   I'm going to spread out how long I spend to work on things."
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.660]   So the back pressure of your artificial work limits really determines what your workload
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.660]   is like.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.460]   If you switch down to four hours, and you're able to get away with that, let's say you're
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.220]   highly autonomous, you're not going to break the norms of your company, what's going to
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.060]   happen is that back pressure will just adjust your workload.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:33.420]   If Oliver's stuck with four hours of work a day, give it six months, and you will see
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:39.740]   these implicit but notable shifts in what's on his plate because you adjust.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.860]   I'm not able to keep up with this many things, and I'm working this many hours.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.860]   So I said no to this.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.860]   I took this off my plate.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.140]   I'm spending twice as long for this.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.940]   You would adjust to that new workload.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.540]   And the thing is what he's noticing, and I think this is true, is even a relatively drastic
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.060]   shift in your workload, so down from what you can fit in eight hours to four hours,
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:05.900]   in the end will likely not seem to have a major difference on your impact as a professional,
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.400]   the quality work that you produce that actually moves the needle because often when we're
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.940]   pruning back this workload, we're pruning stuff that's less important, and we're working
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.540]   more efficiently and more quality deeply on the stuff that does matter.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.020]   So we do have a lot to give.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.660]   So why don't we see more experimentations like this?
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.260]   It's typically norms.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.020]   And that's what it really comes down to, and that's probably the piece that's missing from
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:38.980]   Oliver's essay the most is it is very difficult in most knowledge work situations to be saying
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.620]   no or turning things down when you could be saying yes.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.960]   You're not doing things in the afternoon because you don't work in the afternoon.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.780]   It's a time people normally work.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.300]   It's an amount of work people normally take on.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.780]   It is very hard to walk back from that.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:02.180]   So norms will drive us towards your workload, level of busyness, the schedule you use should
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.940]   fit something we're more or less used to.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.420]   So we end up with a particular artificial limit around eight or nine hours, which is
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.100]   okay but kind of stressful depending on the work, even though it could be much less, just
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.300]   like it could be much more.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.460]   Now, of course, my answer to all of this, and it's hard, but my answer to all of this
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.620]   is we should just move workload management away from the implicit.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.980]   We should move it away from just the outcome of back pressure on your time limits, and
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.020]   then that just leads you naturally to say no to more things.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.900]   I think we should just be much more explicit with workload.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.600]   How much should you be working on?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.780]   What are you working on?
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.820]   When does that do?
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.980]   This is a reasonable load.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.700]   You're not going to put something else on it.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.740]   And we can tune that up and down, and that should be something negotiable.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.940]   That should be something you could say, here's the salary ranges for this job, depending
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.060]   on which workload you're comfortable with.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.260]   And I can come in and say, great, you know what, I have some young kids at home.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.880]   I'm going to do this for our workload, and we actually manage it that way.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.120]   And it's somewhat less money, but it's worth it.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.660]   And then I can tune it up later in life.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.240]   I think workload management should be explicit.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.580]   But outside of a few small knowledge work fields like software development, we do not
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.580]   do this.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.720]   And I think that's ultimately my takeaway message is this whole piece gets to the way
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.580]   that we implicitly deal with our workload right now, which is just, I don't know, I'm
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.580]   out of time.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.020]   I feel like I can't fit any more.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.460]   So this back pressure will lead me to change my habits.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.760]   It should not be so implicit.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.100]   It should not be so emergent.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.820]   We should have a better way of keeping track of what are you doing and how much you want
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.940]   to do.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.800]   And use that to not only prevent overload, but to allow us to fine-tune this in ways
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.220]   that it has a more diversity of loads and is a lot more sustainable.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:48.700]   It's not the sexiest of topics, workload management, but I do think it's actually at the core of
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.360]   a lot of what a lot of people care about inside knowledge work.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.760]   It's at the core of a lot of the sources of unhappiness that I think people have in their
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.520]   jobs these days.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.160]   So there we go.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.320]   Oliver, thank you for that enlightening article.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   I'm jealous.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   I'm thinking about I would like to do something similar.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.440]   And I think you let us hit on some really interesting points.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.600]   You kind of work similar hours anyway, right?
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.480]   I mean, it's hard for me to say because I— I guess if you don't include your teaching
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   stuff.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.960]   Yeah, because I have multiple jobs.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.560]   If I focused on any one job, if I was just a writer or if I was just a professor, I'm
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.160]   probably already doing something like that.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.880]   It's a reduced workday compared to what my peers are doing.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.240]   And it helps me manage my workload and it improves the quality of what I work on.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.960]   And actually, I think most people don't notice.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   So I think you're right.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.400]   If you pull out my individual jobs, you see I'm doing something like Oliver is doing.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   And I do fine.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.640]   No one really notices.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.680]   It does work out okay.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:08.440]   All right, so I pulled some questions that all I would say roughly have to do with work,
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.720]   the amount you work, the trade-off between work and going off to have fun.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.280]   So sort of all within the same Berkman style, how do I control my work and my workload and
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.320]   its relationship to other parts of my life?
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.840]   Before we get to that though, I want to briefly mention one of the sponsors that makes this
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:32.200]   show possible and that is our friends at Shopify.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.960]   Shopify is your no excuses business partner.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.080]   You can sell online without needing to code or design.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.300]   Bring along your best ideas and Shopify will help you open up shop.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.360]   It makes it easy for you to show up exactly the way you want to.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.880]   You can customize your online store to your style with their flexible templates and powerful
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.800]   tools.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.200]   They have new AI enabled tools powered by Shopify magic to instantly write compelling
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.040]   product descriptions.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.140]   Once you start selling Shopify makes getting paid simple by instantly accepting every type
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.920]   of payment.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   Shopify now powers 10% of all e-commerce in the US and Shopify is truly a global force
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:21.000]   powering Allbirds, Rothies, and Brooklinen among millions of other entrepreneurs of every
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.800]   size across 170 countries.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.120]   Jesse I've long said this, if and when we open up our deep questions with Cal Newport
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.640]   shop for sure Shopify is how we would do that e-commerce experience.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.840]   I mean I know so many people who are running their merch that goes along their online media
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.480]   companies through Shopify.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.320]   It's got that great checkout experience.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.920]   You can make it look just like you want.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.280]   It takes all of the different credit cards and payment sources.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.320]   It helps you with all of that.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.240]   So we have our e-commerce partner, Jesse.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.800]   We just need to figure out what our merch is going to be.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.280]   I think that's the hard part.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:04.720]   It all, Shopify also does a good job of pre-populating your existing information like your name and
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.560]   your address and stuff like that.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.160]   Yeah, because it's less friction for the buyer.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.920]   It's common across all the different Shopify sites.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.760]   So if you've shopped at any Shopify site when you come to the deep question store we're
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.880]   going to open it knows your information and it can plug it right in.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.100]   So I do really appreciate that.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:31.160]   So sign up for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify.com/deep all lowercase.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.840]   Go to Shopify.com/deep to take your business to the next level today.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840]   That's Shopify.com/deep.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:45.560]   I also want to talk about our friends at Cozy Earth.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:53.540]   I have to say of the things I am missing most being up here in New Hampshire is our Cozy
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.740]   Earth sheets from back home in Tacoma Park.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.140]   I've mentioned this before on the show.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.220]   My wife and I love their sheets so much so that we had one pair they had sent us and
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.180]   we really were depressed the weeks where we would switch, you know, wash them and we'd
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.620]   have another pair of sheets on the bed.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.700]   So we bought more.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:18.020]   So we went and bought more so that we could always have Cozy Earth sheets on our bed.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.260]   Incredibly comfortable, temperature regulating.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.720]   I'd never had fancy sheets before.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.980]   This made me into a believer.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.640]   Now here's the thing.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.740]   If you try it and you don't agree with me, well A, that means you're wrong and a heathen
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.560]   and a barbarian and I don't want to know you.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.460]   But also they will refund your purchase price plus shipping, no questions asked.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.980]   They'll give you 100 nights to try them out.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.980]   That's right, 100 nights.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.340]   They'll make that type of guarantee because they know it's great.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.100]   There's a reason why this brand has made Oprah's favorite things five years in a row.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.300]   It's really comfortable sheets.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:58.700]   They're made from viscous, a product of bamboo so it traps less heat but it's still very
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.580]   soft and comfortable.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.580]   Great sheets.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.580]   So here's the good news.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.600]   At the end of the time you can save up to 40% on Cozy Earth.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:15.540]   Go to CozyEarth.com, that's C-O-Z-Y, CozyEarth.com and enter the promo code "deepquestions" at
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.540]   checkout.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.900]   That's with a space, deepspacequestions, at checkout and you will save up to 40% now.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.900]   That really makes a difference.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.380]   You definitely want to use a discount code.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.580]   So if you want to try Cozy Earth sheets for 100 nights, try it for 100 nights and if you
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.460]   don't sleep cooler, send it back and ask for a full refund but to get that discount you
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.300]   have to go to CozyEarth.com and use that promo code "deepquestions".
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.660]   We probably could have just brought these, Jesse.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.820]   I probably should have just brought our sheets up here.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.820]   I didn't think that through.
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:49.340]   I was actually thinking that while you were talking about it.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.340]   Yeah, I know.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.060]   You got a lot of things to bring.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.060]   Camera equipment, you know.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.060]   Exactly.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.260]   Yeah, I got all these lights.
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:01.380]   Kids, that's another thing I had to bring which took up a lot of space it turns out.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.700]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.380]   Who do we got first?
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.020]   All right, first question, Natasha from New York.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:13.220]   I was hoping you can spend more time elaborating on what the celebration bucket may include.
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.140]   One of the most recent episodes you mentioned hobbies but do you also include actual celebrations
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.740]   like birthdays or graduations or even vacations?
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:26.960]   Yeah, celebration is maybe not the most descriptive term but let's just step back and set the
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   stage.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:35.060]   So our old way of conceiving of cultivating the deep life just focused on these buckets.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.960]   Identify the different areas of your life that matter and overhaul them one by one supported
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.620]   by habits.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.880]   One of those buckets we would often give was celebration.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.020]   That was one of the example buckets.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.420]   Now if we want to put this into the context of our deep life stack, the new way we think
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.900]   about cultivating the deep life, these buckets or areas of your life are relevant in the
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.460]   final layer of the stack.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.020]   That's the vision layer, the layer in which you plan for the remarkable and it's where
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.700]   you take different areas of your life and try to overhaul them in a remarkable direction.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.740]   So that's how this maps onto our new way of thinking about the deep life.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:15.280]   Celebration, that term was being used because it started with a C. And I was trying early
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.820]   on to try to make all of our sample buckets I gave, sample areas of your life to alliterate
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.200]   and I'll start with Cs.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.680]   But this I think is a good point that Natasha makes.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.080]   When you hear celebration, you think about literal celebrations, birthdays, graduations,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.240]   or vacations.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   What I actually meant when I talked about the celebration area of your life was more
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.920]   celebrating the nice aspects of life.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:47.000]   So other terms here that might be appropriate would be gratitude or enjoyment or appreciation.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.740]   And if we want to be a little bit more specific here, we think about this area of your life
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:57.000]   in which you were doing things for non-instrumental reasons.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.400]   So activities or experiences that don't have some other goal, like this is going to help
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.920]   grow my business, it's going to help me make more money, this is going to put me in better
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.280]   health or fitness.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:15.400]   But things you do for no other reason than just the pure enjoyment or appreciation of
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.640]   the experience.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:24.060]   So types of activities that this area of your life might entail include high-quality leisure.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.780]   So you really get into the craft of building something or writing or painting where it's
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.780]   woodworking.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.580]   It's just the appreciation of the craft.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.580]   You're not selling it.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.280]   You're not trying to use this as a way to get over here.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.900]   You just appreciate the craft of something and you can be lost in that.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.020]   Adventures fall into this.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:49.220]   You know, we're going to go hike one of the high peaks of the White Mountains just for
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.500]   the experience of being above the tree line and what it's like and it's dramatic up there
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:00.660]   and it's meditative and just there's gratitude for life and the world when you're up there.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.980]   That's a classic celebration bucket type activity.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.940]   Other well-engineered experiences, even if they're not adventures, count in here.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.260]   I mean, for the gourmand to go to a restaurant where they just really appreciate the food
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:17.660]   or for the cinephile to go to see the movie of a director and just to really appreciate
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.100]   the cinematic experience.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.820]   So this brings us to connoisseurship more generally.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.220]   That really falls into this area of life as well.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:31.340]   Developing over time a real expertise in something just so you can enjoy the quality of something.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.360]   You can appreciate what makes this good versus bad.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.740]   Why is that car such a cool classic car?
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.020]   Why is that book such a well-written novel?
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.700]   All of that falls into this area of your life.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.780]   So when you get to that plan level, the vision level layer of the deep life stack and you're
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.940]   looking for areas of your life to overhaul, I think this is a fun one.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.780]   It's how can I inject into my life in some really intentional ways much more of this
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.260]   really just sort of appreciating non-instrumental quality experiences.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:06.660]   And I think this is a good one for almost every phase of life.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.800]   When you're in that hard charging phase of life in your 20s, your professional ambitions
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.860]   might start to drown that out and that could be an issue.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.780]   So I need to make sure I have this in my life in an intentional way.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.860]   Having kids can kind of push this out of your life at first and you really want to try to
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.420]   claw it back into your life as soon as you can.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.140]   There's sort of the upper middle age malaise as your kids are getting older and you're
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.100]   sort of ossifying in your career.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.900]   How do I inject something new, something new I'm learning how to do?
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.700]   Something new I'm mastering, the adventures I'm going on.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.260]   I'm thinking a lot about this now.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.740]   I'm trying to think about how to get more of this in my life as I leave that, okay,
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.780]   I have a bunch of young kids all hands on deck stage to have a little bit more breathing
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.820]   room being able to do things with them, just moving on in my career where it's more stable.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.520]   This is definitely an area when I get that layer of my stack each year that I'm starting
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.380]   to think about more.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.880]   So I think celebration is probably not the right term anymore.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.020]   Let's now say when you get to the deep layer stack, the one area of your life that you
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:13.220]   might think about is we could call it quality or enjoyment.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.780]   Maybe that terminology is going to work better.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.300]   I'll tell you, Jesse, people up here understand that.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   By up here I mean New Hampshire.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:26.340]   I think especially because two things, the winters are hard and the summers are beautiful.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.500]   I think there's this sense of in a way that you can't get away with, you could get away
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.220]   with this in DC or New York where you could just be, yeah, I'm just, my job and I just
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.980]   work and we kind of work late and because we go to like a cool restaurant or whatever.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:46.100]   Around here, I think people are much more intentional about these non-instrumental things
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.100]   in their life.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.380]   It's like the winter is coming.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.260]   Someone told me at dinner the other night, if you're not skating or skiing, you're going
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.260]   to be in trouble.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.080]   Like you need to lean into the winter.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.140]   When the summer comes, you better have things that have nothing to do with your work that
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.180]   you're taking advantage of the weather.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.580]   And I think in the cities you can get away without this.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.580]   It's whatever.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.780]   I don't have a hobby.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.660]   I work a lot and because we go to cool restaurants and bars, there's like stuff going on, you
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:16.860]   can be distracted and you don't need the systematic intentional development of areas of your life
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.500]   that are non-instrumental and high quality.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   But up here, I think there's less to go do.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.260]   There's not 50 interesting bars and restaurants you can move between.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.840]   There's not restored historic movie theaters where you can just go see the latest thing.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.500]   There's not museums and all these readings going on.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.820]   So you have to get careful.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.860]   What am I doing with my time outside of work to really lean into it?
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   I do appreciate that.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   >> That's a good point.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.860]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.500]   >> You're good at that, Jesse.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.160]   I think you have a good, you typically have a pretty fair collection of things.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.540]   You think through pretty intentionally of outside of work.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.540]   >> Golf, tennis.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.220]   >> Big difference between, yeah.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.020]   And then I don't have kids yet.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.700]   So I have a little more time on that end.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:10.940]   But yeah, in terms of even sports like tennis and golf that you have to play if you want
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.180]   to get any better.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.180]   And then you have to fit that in.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.080]   >> Right.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.920]   But then it's probably for the better that you do, right?
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.620]   Because it's a nice counterpoint to other things.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   Because you have to be outside.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.620]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   I mean, it keeps you.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   >> You have to be outside.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.620]   You're moving.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.620]   It's social.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.620]   >> Yep.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   And it's like you're thinking the entire time.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:36.260]   So it's like a, you know, it's a test of like your mental ability to focus for a while.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.380]   Especially if you're playing in matches and stuff.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.380]   >> Yep.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.380]   Yep.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.380]   >> At any level.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.940]   At any level of like either sport.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.940]   >> Yep.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.460]   I got to just be focusing on this.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.100]   I can't let my attention wander.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.100]   So there you go.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.100]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.100]   Because it's really easy to do in like either sport.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.940]   Like you could all of a sudden like look ahead to the next point or something like that.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.620]   I remember Michael Jordan said like never look ahead.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.180]   Just like play like now.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.180]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.180]   Make this fast.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.180]   >> Which is hard to do.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.180]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.180]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.180]   All right.
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.180]   So good.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.180]   There we go.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.180]   All right.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.180]   Let's move on.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.180]   What do we got next?
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.180]   >> All right.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.180]   Next question.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.180]   JT from Texas.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.620]   Cal often talks about individuals who make big changes in their lives in pursuit of depth.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.700]   What's a useful way to think about when a big change is appropriate versus attempting
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.660]   smaller optimizations around the edges?
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.660]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:30.180]   I thought this was relevant to that same top layer of the deep life stack we were just
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.140]   talking about.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.740]   You plan for the remarkables.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:38.900]   You take areas of your life and overhaul them when possible trying to push them to be more
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.900]   remarkable.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.340]   This is where you would make major changes often.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.980]   I'm going to completely change my work.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.100]   I'm going to move.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.980]   I'm going to hike the Appalachian Trail.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:52.860]   This is when you're aiming towards the remarkable is when big changes actually come through.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.740]   So I think it's a really good discussion to have.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:39:01.420]   When is it appropriate to make a big change versus smaller changes, optimize around the
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.540]   edges, just changing parts of your life?
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:08.180]   So I thought we'd start by saying what's the wrong reason to do something dramatic?
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:13.020]   I would say the wrong reason to do something dramatic is because you think just the drama
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.420]   or boldness of the move itself is going to be invigorating.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.420]   I think this is pretty common.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:24.500]   I mean, I see this a lot where people get interested in the change itself.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.300]   I'm going to feel like I'm shaking up my life.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.460]   I'm going to feel excited.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:35.100]   I'm going to feel a sense of possibility when I move to the woods.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.780]   But you're making the move not because of concretely where it's going to lead or what
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.660]   it's going to change, but just because you like the idea of making a move itself.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:47.700]   And often when people do this, they will take off the table other factors that really matter
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   in their life.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.860]   What's the side effects of this going to be?
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.860]   They say, I don't care.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.060]   What's important is I just need to do something big.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.620]   It's the change itself that's going to break me loose from my ossification.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:03.220]   Now that's the wrong reason to do it because the energy and excitement of a big move wears
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.380]   off once the move is done.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.060]   You change, you quit your job, you move to the woods, you begin hiking on the Appalachian
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.060]   Trail.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.900]   And if you're just doing it for the sake of doing, okay, fast forward two weeks, that
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.900]   excitement is gone.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.400]   You're now in a new reality.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.860]   Is that new reality, the new lifestyle configuration this has generated, is it much better?
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.860]   And if it's not demonstrably better, you've made no progress, you may have burned bridges,
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.340]   you may have made other aspects of your life worse.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:32.340]   So I think the right reason to make a major change is when it is part of a considered
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.660]   plan that moves you closer to your vision of an ideal lifestyle.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.740]   And when I say considered, I mean there's two things going on here.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.300]   One, it is pushing you towards something you do care about.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.400]   So it's taking something you do really care about and making that remarkable.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.820]   So it's not just a change itself, it's the change is actually signaling to yourself that
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.040]   something that's core to you is something you take seriously.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.940]   So you're making the move to this new location so that you can be closer to your family.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.940]   Now you're doing that to perhaps signal to yourself that family and family connections
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.000]   are important.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.340]   So you want A, to have an actual value that's being amplified by this big change.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.980]   And two, you've thought through its side effects.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:19.060]   You've thought through holistically when I change this part of my life, what's going
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.660]   to happen to other parts of my life?
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.620]   And am I net-net going to be much closer to my ideal lifestyle or is it a wash or is it
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.060]   perhaps even worse off?
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.620]   Again, I mentioned this before, but it's worth reemphasizing.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:35.240]   There is a blinders effect that I see often when talking to people where they get so in
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:41.240]   love with the idea of changing something that they will purposefully obfuscate the negative
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.620]   side effects.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.140]   I don't want to think about that.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.260]   That might talk me out of it.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.540]   I just love the romance of we're moving to Spain.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.580]   I love the romance of I'm quitting my job to row across the ocean or whatever it is.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.500]   You're now thinking through, well, what about the other parts of my life?
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.660]   And what about family?
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:57.740]   What about my kids?
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.860]   What about financial stability?
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.300]   What about what I get by living in a city?
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.620]   All these other aspects of your life you put blinders on is problems.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.220]   A big change really should be something where you've thought through all the different side
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:15.700]   effects for all the different areas of your life and you like where all of it ends up.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.060]   So let me give you two case studies.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.940]   I'll give you two case studies, one where a big change is a good idea and one where
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.300]   just blindly making a change would be a bad idea.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:31.580]   So an example that's a good idea, this is a story I elaborate in my slow productivity
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.780]   book that's coming out in March.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:41.620]   I told more of the story of Paul Jarvis, who we've talked about before on this show.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:47.300]   I know Paul because he wrote a book once called Company of One that argued for not growing
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:52.500]   your business, but instead keeping your business as you get better at it, keeping it purposefully
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:58.460]   small and leveraging your increasing value as you get better at what you do to actually
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.460]   work less.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.900]   Oh, I can make the same amount of money in less time now.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.580]   So to actually use skill to buy flexibility, not to generate more money.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.500]   It was a really cool book, but I learned more about his story.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.500]   And I'll give you the bare bones version of this, but essentially he was a web developer
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.500]   living in Vancouver.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.380]   Vancouver is a big city.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.460]   He was living in a high rise.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.400]   He described it as a glass cage.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:27.340]   So just up in this high rise, this expensive real estate, working really hard to try to
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.340]   pay the rent.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:33.180]   And him and his wife decided at some point, "Well, we don't like this.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.440]   We don't like living in the city.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.440]   We like nature.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.460]   She likes surfing in particular."
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.140]   So you know, good thing she lives in Canada.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.060]   And they didn't mind the web development stuff, but they had no real interest and you don't
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.860]   want to be an entrepreneur with a big company.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.580]   You don't want to make a lot of money.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:55.020]   And so they moved to Vancouver Island, which is very rural outside of Vancouver in the
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.020]   water there.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:01.820]   They moved to the west side of Vancouver Island to a property in the woods near a small town.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.340]   I think it's called Tolfino, where there's actually a surf break.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.620]   It's like the best Canadian surf break is on this small town on the western coast of
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.300]   Vancouver Island.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.900]   They lived real cheaply.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.460]   They built greenhouses and gardened in their property they had here.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.980]   This was not a fancy property.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.140]   It was sort of isolated.
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:25.860]   And he said, they worked it out and he said, "I could do client work remotely."
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.860]   And that's what he did.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.660]   As he got better, he charged more and had less clients.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.780]   And then he eventually added in some products he would build because he wouldn't have to
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.980]   talk to clients at all to see how they would go.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.300]   And they just lived cheaply.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:39.300]   That was a change moving to the woods that made sense.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.580]   And all the aspects of their life they cared about, their ideal lifestyle, this image of
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.620]   this is, we want to be near a small town and surfing every day and working on our gardens
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.660]   and only working just enough to make ends meet.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.180]   And my skills are lucrative enough that we could do that.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.060]   It was a move that made sense.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.780]   That big change made sense because all of the other aspects of their life were thought
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.660]   through and it helped them.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.500]   And it really leaned into the central value of he didn't care that much about work outside
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.260]   of just doing enough to get by.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:14.820]   Let me give you another example where a massive change would probably not make sense.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.860]   Use myself.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.980]   What if I just said, like right now, you know what?
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.100]   I'm tired of, I have too much on my plate, which is true.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.860]   I have too much on my plate, so enough of this.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:30.300]   I'm just going to quit academia and move to Vermont and just write full time.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:35.020]   Now, again, it's one of these things that on paper you say something like that, you're
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.260]   like, ooh, yeah, that's exciting.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:40.900]   You could see someone like me getting swept away in the excitement of just, we're moving
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.140]   to Vermont and everything's off my plate and I'm just going to, whatever, just write books.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:49.820]   And it feels like a solution to your problems in the moment and the drama is very romantic.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.300]   But let's think that through.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.700]   In my case, we say, okay, how would a change like that, what's the impacts going to be
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.420]   on other parts of my life?
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.860]   What's the impacts going to be on my vision for myself and my work?
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.100]   And suddenly all these issues try to come up.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.460]   I mean, first of all, I enjoy academia.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.740]   I enjoy old universities.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:12.860]   I like the fact that Georgetown where I am is an 18th century university.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.860]   Dartmouth where I am right now is an 18th century university.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.100]   These are places that George Washington visited, old buildings.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   I love that history.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.180]   I love professors and being around the classrooms.
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.740]   I really like that.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:30.860]   What about my kids, for example, the school they go to that we're really closely connected
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.780]   to, all the friends we have around there.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.100]   What about financial stability?
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.900]   Writing can be hit or miss.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:44.260]   You can have drought periods and it's not nearly as stable as, okay, I also have a paycheck
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.180]   with health insurance and benefits.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.380]   What about separation from family?
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.740]   We live in a place that's close to our family.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.860]   What about the reality of full-time living in Vermont?
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.420]   I mean, it's great in July, but call me in February.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.100]   It's a different type of picture, right?
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:05.860]   So if you step back from the romance of let's make a big change, this situation we say,
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:06.860]   I don't know.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:11.980]   I don't have an ideal lifestyle vision in which just living somewhere completely new
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:15.980]   and cut off from this type of work I've done my entire adult life, a lot of that would
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.660]   start to suffer.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.620]   And so that would be a place where you say there are smaller optimizations to make that
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.580]   would get you closer to your ideal lifestyle.
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:28.380]   There's any number of flexible moves you can make within the umbrella of academia and within
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:33.680]   the realm of your own habits that could reduce the burden of I have too much to do.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.540]   You could reduce what's on your plate.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.020]   You could lean into sabbaticals and off semesters.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.220]   You could, if you needed to, perhaps even change your situation somewhat within academia,
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:48.140]   this would be a case study where small intentional changes could help dampen down what was causing
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:54.620]   the problem while still making your overall lifestyle image largely be matching the things
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.620]   you care about.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.620]   So anyways, these are off the top of my head, but I wanted to give two examples where in
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.260]   one a radical change led to an overall better life and another one, a radical change wasn't
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:07.320]   going to solve the problem and it causes many issues as benefits and there's probably smaller
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.660]   fixes to get you closer.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:14.420]   So I don't know, that's maybe a little bit specific, but that's the type of mindset I
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:20.820]   have when I'm thinking through throw it all and move, throw it all, change your job, or
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.780]   I think working within the system is going to be better.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.740]   All right.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.220]   All of Vermont's realtors just cried.
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.020]   All right, let's keep rolling, Jesse.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.020]   What do we got next?
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.020]   All right.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.300]   The next question is from Deep Name.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:42.500]   I read in your deep workbook and in your Tim Ferriss podcast that you rarely work past
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:47.260]   five or 6 p.m., but you didn't mention what time you start your workday.
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.900]   2 a.m.
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:52.140]   No, not really.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:56.660]   So in the normal school year, my workday, it can't begin until after I drop the kids
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.100]   off at the bus stop.
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.380]   So that's 8.30ish, I would say.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.540]   So yeah, no, I rarely work past five or 6 p.m.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.540]   I don't start early.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.540]   I'm not an early riser.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:11.820]   It doesn't make sense to work before we get all the kids fed and packed and out the door
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:12.820]   to the bus stop.
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:18.260]   So usually the earliest I'm working is probably thinking on my walk back from the bus stop
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.540]   after dropping them off.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.340]   I might start thinking in my head about the first thing I'm going to work on so I can
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.120]   hit the ground running when I get back.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.980]   So yeah, my day actually does stay pretty reasonably 9 to 5.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.540]   All right.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.540]   Picking up speed here.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.540]   What do you got next, Jesse?
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.860]   All right.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.420]   Next question, Buzz from Vancouver.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:44.220]   I'm 35 and live in Vancouver and work as a communications manager.
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:48.940]   I live a very fun, lifestyle-centric life centered on outdoor sports.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.580]   The problem is that I'm only managing to save small amounts of money every month, but every
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:58.780]   time I research the next pay grade in my profession, it entails more responsibility in the management
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.860]   of bigger teams.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.100]   I'm not saving enough for retirement, but I don't want to disrupt my current lifestyle
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.740]   to do so.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:12.260]   Well, there's two levers you can push here.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.380]   So one lever is to spend less.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:19.260]   You reduce the cost of your lifestyle, and therefore you're able to save more of the
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:24.020]   money that you are already making.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:31.100]   Other related sub-paths in this general journey would also be to generate other sources of
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.400]   passive income.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.500]   So this could be a situation where you rent out the house you currently have and buy a
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.660]   different cheaper house, and now you have that rental income.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:47.900]   All of these type of things, you could probably find more specific examples in the FIRE community.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.820]   Financial Independence Retire Early.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:55.420]   They're all about reducing their expenses so that they can save much more of the money
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.740]   that they're actually making.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.980]   Now what you would be talking about here in the FIRE community would probably be what
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:09.020]   they refer to as "fat FIRE" because your goal here is not necessarily, "I want to save a
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.940]   huge amount of money very quickly and retire in 10 years."
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:16.060]   Your goal here is just, "I want to make sure that I'm saving enough money for my job, not
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:21.420]   that I want to retire early, but that I can retire when the time comes."
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:26.180]   So fat FIRE is what they refer to as, "You do cut your expenses back so that you can
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:31.260]   save an unusual large percentage of your salary, but you're not trying to save 75% of your
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:32.260]   salary.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.140]   You're still living a relatively full life.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.140]   It's not this sort of Spartan, let's really batten down the hatches and not spend any
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.380]   money lifestyle."
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.940]   So that's probably where you would fall.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.840]   You would check out Mr. Money Mustache, would be a good source.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.220]   Maybe check out the Frugalwoods.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.500]   That's another good source.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:53.780]   I think right now the Frugalwoods, who actually don't live far from where I am right now,
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.500]   neither of them work full-time jobs anymore.
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:03.060]   They use their house from Cambridge, right outside of Boston.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.140]   They kept that house and they rent it.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:10.540]   And I think they're living largely off of that rental income and Liz's freelance writing
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.540]   income.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:13.020]   So they're living very cheaply.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.820]   So that direction you would check out FIRE.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.980]   The other direction is to make more money.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:22.140]   Now, of course, what you're saying here is, "Well, to make more money, if I just kept
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:26.580]   going on my current job path, the next level up is more work and more responsibility, and
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.020]   then I can't do this other stuff I love about being in Vancouver.
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.020]   I can't do all the outdoor sports."
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.940]   All right, so you have a couple options here.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:39.720]   One, you can throw at this issue of gaining more money but not wanting to give up too
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   much autonomy.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.780]   Or you could throw much more advanced self-management, self-organization tactics.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:51.740]   So you could throw at it pure Cal Newport, multi-scale planning, hyperactive hive mind
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.740]   busting processes.
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:56.940]   I mean, you could just come at it, "I know how to organize myself and my work.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.740]   So even though you add more responsibilities, I can still keep control of my schedule in
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:03.900]   a way that I could still do the fun outdoor activities."
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.340]   Now, you might be surprised by what you can get away with.
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.200]   Most people are really bad at this.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.940]   If you're not really bad at this, then you might gain a lot of autonomy over your work.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:16.620]   The other way you could make more money without losing your autonomy is to say, "I have
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:23.140]   to be more creative than just simply what's the next promotion at my particular job."
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:26.380]   And there you need to start thinking about career capital theory, the type of thing I
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.900]   talk about in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.460]   Right now, there might not be another option for you, other than just taking the next rung
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.020]   up and having to manage teams.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:40.440]   But is there a skill you could develop that is sufficiently rare and sufficiently valuable
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:44.920]   that it would give you enough leverage that you could shift your situation to be more
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.880]   money without having to give up a lot of autonomy?
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.540]   Is there a skill you could develop that would allow you to, let's say, trade more accountability
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.880]   for accessibility?
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:01.120]   Judge me on my work, and I am going to do this work at a high level because I'm really
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.920]   good at this now.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.000]   But you're not going to expect accessibility.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.200]   You're not going to expect I can reach you at any time.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.160]   It's instead going to be, "We'll see what you do.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   Do good work.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.680]   As long as you're producing good work, we don't care that you're not available at three
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.560]   on Thursday because you're out mountain biking."
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.040]   So career capital, that is building up rare and valuable skills, can give you leverage
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.540]   for a lot more creative ways forward.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.080]   So we have two different directions here.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.000]   You can spin less, and there we said, "Look at the fire community, especially the fat
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   fire community."
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.200]   Or you could make more without unnecessarily giving up more of your autonomy.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.340]   And there you're going to want to care about being better organized, about how you manage
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:42.920]   your obligations and attention, and also thinking about career capital theory, building up skills
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:46.680]   that you can then cash in for gaining more autonomy.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   The right answer is probably some sort of combination of the two.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:55.400]   So probably what you're going to want to do is think through your finances more carefully,
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:00.080]   find some ways, and again, the fire community will be very helpful here to increase the
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:04.800]   amount of money you're saving to maybe generate some other source of passive income that can
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.440]   all go towards savings.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.360]   And then mix that with some sense of, "How do I make more money without giving everything
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.360]   up?"
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.280]   And again, some notion of, "I'm more organized than most people," or, "I'm working now very
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.760]   intensely on skills so that three years from now I can change my situation into one that
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.920]   is going to allow me to have more options.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.200]   I can make more money without having to completely give up my autonomy."
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.880]   I would look at both of those paths at the same time.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.680]   If you're serious about both those paths, you will find some combination where I think
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.600]   you're going to feel financially pretty secure and still be able to do those other things
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   you care about.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:43.160]   And the main thing I appreciate here is that you are looking at the full lifestyle holistically,
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:47.880]   and you know for you right now at your stage of life, these outside sports, these adventure
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:53.120]   activities are a key part of what earlier in the show we used to call the celebration
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.400]   bucket and now we said we should rename to something else.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.360]   That you know that's important and you're trying to build a lifestyle that includes that
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.760]   and includes work.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.720]   This is what this more holistic lifestyle-centric planning looks like.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:09.360]   You're trying to make changes where pushing this doesn't drop this, or we can improve
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.680]   this while not hurting this.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.400]   And I think it's a great example of exactly those types of trade-offs.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:19.200]   All right, so what I want to do instead of a final question is actually a case study.
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:25.480]   This is something a listener sent in and it felt very relevant to the type of issues we've
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.600]   been talking about on the show.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.080]   So let me read this here.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:38.160]   I'm obfuscating a little bit, obfuscating a few details here because I don't know how
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.520]   much anonymity is being expected.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.840]   So I'll obfuscate a few details here.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.660]   All right, so here's the message and I'll read this here.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:51.680]   I am the "exhausted professor" from episode 197.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.960]   A little more than a year has passed since Cal answered my question about how to plan
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.640]   my time during my sabbatical.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:02.740]   Not only had it been a decade since my previous sabbatical, but I was also recovering from
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:07.840]   having been department chair for the previous five years, so I was at that time exhausted.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.520]   Cal advised me to operate at the 30% level, recharge my batteries, work on things that
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:17.500]   are interesting to me, and make myself as scarce as I had been back when I was doing
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.240]   field work in Antarctica.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.520]   Turns out that's exactly what I needed to do.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:26.320]   And I'm so glad I had Cal's blessing to do it.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:30.040]   I read a lot of interesting books, hung out with my friends and family, and spent lots
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:34.080]   of quality time with my dog during the final few months of her life.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:39.560]   I also gave my career some serious thought, did a little lifestyle-centric career planning,
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:44.680]   and ultimately left my 10-year position at my state university for a different career
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.200]   at a top-10 school.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.440]   While I was sad to leave my old colleagues and students, I needed a new adventure.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.320]   I started my new job in May, and I totally love it.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.720]   I have wonderful new colleagues and students, and my work is very fulfilling.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:02.560]   I am ever so thankful to Cal for imploring me to recharge, not worry about being productive.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.880]   Many thanks to you for choosing my question and for your great work on the show.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:12.080]   So I thought this was a great case study for a couple reasons.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:19.240]   I think one, this shows the slow productivity philosophy in action to just always be going
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.360]   full bore.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.220]   I am busy, I am filling every hour of the day.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:29.120]   Not only is it not sustainable, but it becomes an obstacle to actually evolving yourself
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:34.680]   and evolving your life by taking more time, having seasonality here.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:39.600]   When we come off a busy period to go to a slow period, this listener was actually able
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.240]   to gain the insight needed to not only recharge, but make some interesting career decisions,
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.880]   to do a really thorough lifestyle-centric career planning analysis that led her to leave
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:56.160]   tenure to take another type of job in academia, which she's really liking.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.500]   So I like this idea of slowing down sometimes.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.120]   Not everything should be full bore.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.960]   Figuring out what's going on, getting reconnected with the things that really matter, and seeing
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.440]   what decisions you might or might not make, what course corrections you need to do that
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.920]   really thoughtfully.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.880]   Not to just lash out, not to just in year five of your department chairmanship to say,
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.320]   you know what, enough of this, I'm quitting and moving to Vermont.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.400]   And say, okay, hold on a second, this is almost over, then I have a sabbatical, let's give
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.960]   this some space, let's slow things down and think more critically about what I want to
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   do.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.280]   And recognizing in general that life is long, days and seasons are short.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.640]   In the long scheme of things, no one's going to notice that you didn't do a lot of work
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.240]   during your sabbatical, but for this particular person, it made a really big difference.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:45.040]   So I thought that was a great ending case study for our discussion today of Berkman's
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:49.560]   idea of doing less on purpose and seeing what you discover.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.040]   Because in this case, what she discovered was a lot about herself and what she cared
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.920]   about and made some big changes.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:58.480]   That was a cool case study.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:03.360]   All right, so I want to jump on to a final segment here where I react to something that's
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.440]   either happening on the internet or someone sent to me.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:12.680]   But before I do, I also want to take the opportunity to talk about another one of sponsors that
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.800]   makes this show possible.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.680]   And that is our longtime friends at Grammarly.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:27.080]   And in particular, I want to talk about their new product, Grammarly Go.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:37.360]   So Grammarly Go harnesses the power of generative AI to help you produce better writing.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.760]   Now there's two elements here that go back to what I talk about a lot.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.840]   First of all, writing I've talked about a lot, being able to communicate clearly and
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.080]   effectively is critical to success in our current world.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.400]   And then when I've talked about AI, I've often said this is where we're going to see the
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.920]   difference, especially with generative AI is in these narrow application to specific
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.440]   parts of our life that are linguistic, where it can help.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:06.320]   And so Grammarly Go, this new product offered by Grammarly is the collision of these two
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.760]   ideas that I have talked about a lot.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.760]   So what can you do with Grammarly Go?
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.260]   Well, let me give you some examples here.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:18.360]   So one thing you could do, for example, is their reply feature, the Grammarly Go reply
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.980]   feature, which will summarize when you're working with your inbox, when you're working
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:30.960]   with email, it will summarize the email and give you suggestions on how to reply so you
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.400]   can get through your inbox quicker.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.480]   So you sort of get a first draft of what you are going to reply.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.040]   It can also help you with ideas.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.280]   Give me ideas for decorating a taco truck.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.960]   That's something you can ask Grammarly Go.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   It'll give you some ideas.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.880]   You can use that to help write the thing you need to write.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.440]   Give me 10 possible taglines for this video thumbnail.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.200]   It will give you ideas, starting point for your creative process.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.720]   Let me go with this one and let me polish it.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:00.920]   It will also help you rewrite for different tones or styles.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.200]   So you could write out something pretty quick and then say, "Okay, the Grammarly Go, make
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.440]   this sound more professional."
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.000]   It will rewrite it in a more professional tone.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.400]   Make this sound more exciting.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.600]   It will rewrite it in a more exciting tone.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.960]   The large language models behind generative AI are very good at working with styles.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.640]   So this is just examples of the type of things you can do with Grammarly Go.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.800]   So anyways, I think this is a very interesting tool.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.480]   You're already doing a lot of writing in your job and you want this writing to be as good
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.800]   as possible and you want to be efficient in all this writing.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.700]   This is like having an assistant looking over your shoulder that has one goal, to make you
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.680]   more effective at communicating.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.920]   You'll be amazed at what you can do with Grammarly Go.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.400]   Just go to grammarly.com/go to download and learn more about Grammarly Go.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   That's G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.com/go.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:03:00.900]   I also want to talk about our friends at Policy Genius.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:06.080]   If you have a family or someone who depends on you, then you know that it is important
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:08.480]   for you to have life insurance.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.080]   In the worst case, if something happens to you, you do not want them to have to worry
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.140]   about money.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:14.280]   This is common sense.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.240]   So if you know you need life insurance or you know you need more life insurance, but
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.080]   you don't currently have it, the question is why not?
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.680]   And the answer is almost always because it's a pain.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.160]   It's ambiguous.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.760]   How do you figure out what insurance to get?
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   Where do you go?
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   Who do you talk to?
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.040]   Are you going to have to go to a doctor's office and have tests made?
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.640]   It seems ambiguous and hard, and so we procrastinate on it.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:45.120]   This is where Policy Genius enters the scene because it makes it easy to find and get a
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.720]   good life insurance policy.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.280]   Their technology allows you to compare life insurance quotes from America's top insurers
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.840]   in just a few clicks.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.440]   Because you're comparing, you can save money.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:03.360]   With Policy Genius, you can find life insurance policies that start at just $25 per month
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.760]   for $1 million of coverage.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:13.280]   Some options offer coverage in as little as a week and avoid unnecessary medical exams.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.220]   Their licensed award-winning agents can help you find exactly the type of insurance you
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.680]   need for your needs.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.000]   They work for you and not the insurance companies.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.440]   They do not have an incentive to recommend one insurer over another.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:30.680]   Their incentive is to make you, the customer, satisfied.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:34.280]   This is why they have thousands of five-star reviews on Google and Trustpilot.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.100]   So your loved ones deserve a financial safety net.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.680]   You deserve a smarter way to find and buy it.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:44.500]   Head to policygenius.com or click the link in the description to get your free life insurance
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.120]   quotes and see how much you could save.

[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:57.580]   All right, let's go to our final segment now where we talk about something that I've encountered
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.600]   in my week that I thought was worth discussing.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:10.440]   I'll say today's thing I want to react to is connected to a deeper dilemma I have.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.880]   And so maybe I'll solicit, Jesse, the comment of our audience here to help me answer this
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.880]   dilemma.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.240]   The thing I'm going to show today, I would say, 12 different readers sent to me.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.920]   It's about the director Christopher Nolan's technology habits.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:32.200]   I thought I would feature this today because his new movie Oppenheimer is out now in theaters.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.080]   I'm a big Chris Nolan fan.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.640]   I think Dunkirk is a masterpiece.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.280]   I'm very excited about what he did here.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:45.080]   But before we get to this quick news hit about Chris Nolan's technology habits, here's my
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.040]   dilemma.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.320]   Do I see Oppenheimer up here?
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.880]   Yeah, Jesse knows.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.200]   Do I see it up here in New Hampshire?
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.760]   Or do I risk waiting until later in August when I'm back in DC and I can actually see
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.560]   a large format projection?
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.720]   What's the risk?
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.680]   What if it's no longer in theaters when I get back?
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.000]   It will be in theaters.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   You think so?
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.320]   That's only like a month away.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.040]   Well, I think I should wait because Nolan filmed most of this in a combination of 70
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.440]   millimeter and IMAX format, which is a 65 millimeter format.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:29.360]   I don't want to disparage the Hanover Nugget movie theater.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.280]   Because again, I have good experiences there.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.360]   I went here when I was a college kid.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.800]   Their screens are not massive.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.600]   Their projectors are not large format projectors.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.160]   The one nice thing about DC is there's plenty of IMAX theaters that can project this capacity
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:48.320]   also the AFI theater, non-profit theater in Silver Spring, not far from where I live has
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.200]   a 70 millimeter projector as well.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.480]   In fact, I saw Dunkirk.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.840]   When I saw Dunkirk for the first time, I went to see the 70 millimeter projection.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.880]   So Oppenheimer is filmed in large format.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.760]   So this is what I'm trying to weigh.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   Should I risk it?
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760]   I'll wait.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.760]   Okay.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.760]   If it's out of the theaters though, Jesse, I'm going to be upset.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.760]   If I get back.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.760]   Fire me.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.600]   Like Mad Dog and Steve Torrey.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.760]   Just like Mad Dog and Steve Torrey.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.600]   I'll be like, Jesse, you're out of here.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:23.200]   Now what we'll have to do after we convince the Washington Nationals that deep work consulting
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.800]   is worth three wins above replacement for their season, we then have to convince Chris
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:32.960]   Nolan and his team that deep work is somehow going to be critical to their work.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:37.160]   And then I'll be able to go see a print with him in his personal projection room.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160]   All right.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.760]   So if you get the Nats job and they want you there, you have to get there early so you
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.200]   have plenty of time to read.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.320]   So you can read for like 90 minutes before you have to do your thing.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.320]   I want to do.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:55.040]   I want to be up in the owner's box reading, having a cigar with Mike.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.720]   And then it's like time for me just to get the team kind of fired up.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   I'm telling you.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.760]   I'll hang out with Charlie Schlose and Dan Colco.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.440]   It'll all be fun.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.440]   All right.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440]   Let's get to this actual news item.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.560]   By the way, you can chime in if you think I'm making the wrong risk in waiting to see
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.520]   the Oppenheimer in large format, but I'll tell you, I looked it up.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:18.080]   The nearest IMAX to Hanover that I could find was an hour, 20 minutes.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.200]   So it's another reason, another issue with living up here full time.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200]   You got to have your large format.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.200]   All right.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.440]   So let me show you this, this small thing I found.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.800]   I've actually written about this before on my blog, but this is just an honor.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.200]   This is an honor of Mr. Nolan.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.960]   A lot of people sent this to me.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.960]   All right.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.280]   This is from the Hollywood Reporter.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.880]   I'll load it up on the screen here.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.680]   So here's the article.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.640]   It's about Nolan from mid-July.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.680]   The headline is "This can't be safe.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.680]   It's got to have bite.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:54.840]   Christopher Nolan and cast unleash Oppenheimer, the director and star Cillian Murphy, Emily
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:59.000]   Blunt and Matt Damon on the stakes of making an R-rated three-hour CGI-free summer flick
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.640]   about the Godfather, the atomic bomb.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.760]   It's got to be beautiful and threatening in equal measure."
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.440]   This is why I have to see this thing in IMAX.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:09.280]   They actually built a practical, it's not actually an atomic bomb, but the bomb explosion
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.680]   is real.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.760]   They built from scratch a 65mm black and white camera, which did not exist, a black and white
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:23.760]   IMAX camera, and then a super high-speed camera of the same type they had originally developed
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.000]   for the Trinity test in Los Alamos.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.680]   So a camera that can record at super high speeds.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.400]   And they did a real massive explosion and really filmed it with this camera they built
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:38.040]   from scratch to simulate the cameras they used to record the original atomic explosion
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.080]   so they didn't have to use computer graphics.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.080]   It's all really cool.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.080]   But here's a quote.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.080]   I don't know where it is in the article, but I do have it just written down in my note.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:49.240]   So later in this article, there is a quote.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240]   Let me see.
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.640]   I think I wrote it in here.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   Here we go.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.640]   All right.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   So later in the article, and I'll stop the sharing here.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:01.040]   There's a quote that reads, "It's not just in his filmmaking that Nolan prefers to rely
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.240]   on analog methods.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.720]   He doesn't use email or carry a smartphone.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.960]   And when he writes his scripts, he does so on a computer that isn't connected to the
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.120]   internet.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.720]   My kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite," he says.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.400]   "I would actually resist that description.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.560]   I think technology and what it can provide is amazing.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.080]   My personal choice is about how involved I get.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.920]   It's about the level of distraction.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.000]   If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.640]   day wouldn't be very useful to me."
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.880]   That is, of course, music to my ears.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.760]   I think there should be many more professions in which that's really normal.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.840]   You say, "Why would I have a smartphone?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.080]   I'm training an elite athlete.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.360]   Why would I have a smartphone?
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.680]   I'm a full-time writer, and that's only going to get in the way of what I do."
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.040]   I love those types of examples.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.800]   I think the more we see people doing incredibly focused activities where they're intentional
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.800]   about their technology, the more we'll see that bleed into maybe less attention-catching
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800]   roles.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.440]   We'll see more of that bleed in from movie directors, and we can have more of that in
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:08.160]   just your life as an executive or a teacher.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.000]   But mainly it's just cool, and I think Chris Nolan is cool.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.760]   I think his movies are cool, and I love the fact he doesn't use an internet-connected
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.440]   computer and he doesn't own a smartphone because he's trying to build $300 million movies.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:25.000]   He doesn't have time to be following the latest attention economy distraction.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.280]   Nolan, good for you.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.880]   I'll have to find another way to convince you to hire me to come watch Oppenheimer with
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880]   you in person.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.320]   I can't email you, so we'll try to go through your people, but don't worry.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   Jesse's on it.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   He'll work it out.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   And if he doesn't, I'll fire him.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.880]   All right.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.680]   That's all the time we have for today.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.280]   Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.920]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the Deep Questions podcast.
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:59.960]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
