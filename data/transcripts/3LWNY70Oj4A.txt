[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   The following is a conversation with Carl Hart,
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.920]   department chair and professor of psychology
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.880]   at Columbia University.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.120]   He's the author of several books on the topic of drugs,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   including his most recent called "Drug Use for Grownups"
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.520]   that challenges us to, quote,
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.360]   "Use empirical evidence to guide public policy,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.800]   "even if it makes us uncomfortable."
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.400]   His research on drugs, including hard drugs
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.160]   like heroin and cocaine,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.680]   challenges much of what we think we know
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.520]   about drugs and their role in society.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.160]   His main thesis is that drug addiction
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.600]   has less to do with the drugs themselves
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.800]   and more to do with co-occurring psychiatric disorders,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   such as depression and schizophrenia,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.840]   and socioeconomic factors,
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.160]   such as unemployment, underemployment,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.840]   and resource deprivation within the community.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.480]   In addition, he believes that we should legalize all drugs
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.320]   so that if people choose to use them,
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.160]   they could do so responsibly and openly
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.640]   and get help if needed in a controlled, safe environment.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.720]   His ideas are controversial,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.520]   but are fundamentally grounded in empirical data
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   and rigorous scientific studies.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.040]   I don't know if his conclusions are right,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.680]   but they are at least worth thinking about.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.960]   So I ask that you consider these ideas with an open mind,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.400]   and as always, make sure you exercise
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.040]   your critical thinking skills
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.520]   in making decisions about substances you put in your body.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.120]   You are a free-thinking being,
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   the main character, if you will,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.920]   the hero in a story that's being written by you.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.240]   So at the end of the day,
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.200]   you are responsible for the choices you make.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.520]   So choose wisely.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.640]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.320]   in the description.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.220]   And now, here's my conversation with Carl Hart.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.760]   I think it is bold and powerful to admit
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.400]   to using in your private life
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.540]   the drugs that you study in your research,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.200]   including heroin and cocaine.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.720]   So let me ask,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.700]   what is the experience of taking heroin like?
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.680]   What happens to the body?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.920]   What happens to the mind when you take it?
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.760]   - Well, you know, I take MDMA, cannabis,
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.480]   and all the rest of these drugs too.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.880]   I've tried those drugs.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.760]   The experience in the body and the mind,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.560]   I don't really know what people wanna know in that regard.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.400]   It's like saying,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.040]   what's the weirdest experience of having an orgasm
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.440]   in the body and the mind?
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.260]   Or some other sort of event that you really enjoy.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.240]   So I don't really know what people--
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.280]   - Is that what poetry is for,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.060]   for describing these kinds of experiences?
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.580]   I mean, I guess,
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.240]   given MDMA, given psilocybin,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.960]   in the full context of that,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.360]   maybe it's more useful to say,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   what are the differences in experiences
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.840]   that your mind goes through?
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.880]   Like chemically, biologically,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.360]   so it's like keeping it strictly to sort of
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.080]   the biology of it
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.780]   versus the full environmental human experience.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.200]   - Yeah, see, this is a mistake
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.760]   that people make all the time.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.800]   They try to act as if biology
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.120]   is the only determinant of drug effects,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.280]   and that's just not how it works.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.640]   You need the environment.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.600]   You need the cage, as they say.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.320]   If you don't have the cage,
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.240]   you don't get the full extent of the effects.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.840]   And so you can take MDMA and have an awful time.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.880]   You can have a time in which you get paranoid and so forth,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.760]   and then you can take that drug under the right conditions,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880]   and it just be one of the best moments you've ever had.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.640]   It certainly enhanced a number of my relationships,
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.040]   but I've also had some times with MDMA
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.680]   that haven't been so lovely
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.760]   when the people who you are hanging out with,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.600]   you don't know 'em, you're distrustful,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.960]   and all of those kind of things.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.800]   So it's important to put context in it.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.840]   Now, we can talk about drugs at a biochemical level,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.120]   at a biological level,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.840]   and we kind of do that in this country
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.000]   with this fascination with neuroscience,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.320]   and that's an inappropriate kind of fascination
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.520]   in the way we talk about it.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.760]   So we can talk about opioids,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.360]   and then we can talk about endogenous opioid system
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.200]   in the brain.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.760]   We can talk about dopamine
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.640]   and other sort of monoamine transmitters
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.840]   and what opioids are doing to them,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.120]   and we can do the same thing with MDMA,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   and we won't be any closer to understanding
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   the sort of experience that is induced by these drugs,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.360]   certainly the experience that we all seek.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.400]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.040]   - So getting a positive experience
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.360]   or getting a negative experience
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.040]   is strongly defined by the environment.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.000]   - Strongly dependent upon the environment.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.920]   - But the environment is a very,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.840]   it's a short word that can describe a lot of things.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.880]   So would you say the environment is important,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.720]   or the people, where you are currently in your life,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.400]   or is it also dependent on the full trajectory
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.640]   of your psychology, of your life experiences,
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.040]   of your parents, of the people you came up with,
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.880]   of the trauma you've experienced,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.160]   of the hopes and dreams that were crushed,
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.880]   or not, or the opposite, or the success levels,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.720]   or all those things.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.600]   Like what are the interesting sort of landscape
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.480]   of experiences that contribute to how you actually feel
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.440]   when you take a drug?
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.400]   - Right on.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.160]   So all of those things are important,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.200]   but you know, like if someone had trauma in childhood
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   and they did the work and they dealt with it,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.520]   that's not so important in this case.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.720]   But if they didn't deal with it
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.840]   and that trauma is being triggered in that event,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.120]   in that moment, then it's important.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.400]   But let's just take somebody like me.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.640]   I'm 54 years old, I'll be 55 this month, actually.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.080]   And you know, I've done a lot of work
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.120]   in terms of figuring out who I am,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.640]   and I'm comfortable with myself.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.640]   And I know how to set limits for whatever it is I'm doing.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.040]   And so I know I need to work out.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.520]   I know I need to eat well.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.240]   I know I need to sleep well.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.880]   I know I need to be in an environment
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.920]   with people within my trust.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.200]   And then if all of those things are met,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.560]   oh, it's likely to be a good time.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.400]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.040]   But if I haven't slept, if I haven't worked out,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.400]   if I don't feel good, it won't be a good time.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.840]   But I try and be responsible
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   and take care of my eating habits, sleeping habits,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.120]   make sure my responsibilities are taken care of.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.080]   And so when I'm in that moment, I just enjoy that moment.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.920]   I'm there, I'm not thinking about a bill that I didn't pay.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.760]   I'm not thinking about, oh, I forgot to do this for my kid.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.880]   I'm not thinking about that
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.780]   because all of those things are taken care of.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.080]   If they're not taken care of, it will impact the experience
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.560]   and it may negatively impact the experience.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.520]   - Well, that is the counterintuitive,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.080]   even controversial finding from your recent book.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.860]   So we should kind of, I know it seems obvious to you,
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.640]   but I think a lot of people hearing this
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.120]   would think it's quite non-obvious.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.360]   So in your new book, "Drug Use for Grownups,"
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.960]   you write for the finding section,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.040]   "I discovered that the predominant effects
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.160]   produced by the drugs discussed in this book are positive.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.320]   It didn't matter whether the drug in question was cannabis,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.400]   cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or psilocybin.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.280]   Overwhelmingly, consumers expressed feeling more altruistic,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.320]   empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.840]   They also experienced enhanced social interactions
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.680]   that create a sense of purpose and meaning
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.320]   and increased sexual intimacy and performance.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.480]   This constellation of findings
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.600]   challenged my original beliefs about drugs
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.960]   and their effects.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.520]   I had been indoctrinated to be biased
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   toward the negative effects of drug use,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.020]   but over the past two plus decades,
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.080]   I had gained a deeper, more nuanced understanding."
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.480]   These words are very counterintuitive to a lot of people.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.480]   I think, like you also mentioned in the book and elsewhere,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.520]   you know, people have come around to maybe psilocybin
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.640]   being one such drug, maybe cannabis being one such drug,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.400]   but you also mentioned other drugs
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.660]   like cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.700]   Can you just linger on this point?
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.020]   How do we get the positive effects of those drugs
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.760]   and why in the media and the general conception
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.240]   we have of these drugs is that they were going to
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.360]   make a bad life worse or ruin a good life?
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.880]   - Well, so your first question was
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.520]   how do we harness the positive effects?
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.840]   How do we increase the likelihood
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.080]   of getting the positive effects?
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.700]   Again, like I said, we wanna make sure
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.600]   that people are responsible
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.720]   and they've handled their responsibilities,
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.260]   make sure they eat well, sleep well, exercise,
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.200]   all of those sorts of things play an important role.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.280]   And also, if they know exactly what they're getting
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.320]   and then they're not paranoid about,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.480]   it's something contaminated in some adulterant,
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.620]   it's in my drug.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.080]   So you wanna make sure you know exactly what you have.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.800]   Once you satisfy those kind of things,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.960]   you understand the dose and potency,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.480]   you understand all of those things,
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.560]   to decrease any sort of anxiety you might have
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.520]   about the substance itself,
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.000]   it increases the likelihood
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.560]   that you will have a better time.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.840]   - So anxiety is the big one,
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.120]   you need to remove the anxiety.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.600]   Anxiety is critical, it's huge.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.400]   Many of the negative effects that we see with drugs
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.280]   have to do with anxiety.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.640]   And not necessarily anxiety because the drug induced it,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.160]   it's the anxiety that the situation induced a lot of times.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.200]   And then you ask like,
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.400]   well, why does this sound counterintuitive?
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   Why does the media report differently?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.200]   Well, because there's money in reporting
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.320]   the negative effects almost exclusively.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   Think about writing a newspaper article.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.680]   It's really easy to get the population all ginned up
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.000]   about something like an opioid crisis, overdoses,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.680]   and you don't even have to tell people
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.000]   how to keep people safe if you're talking about overdose.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.560]   You don't even have to say,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.740]   why people are dying from overdoses?
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.640]   Like overdoses in our country happen largely
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.220]   because people get contaminated drug,
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.360]   because people are combining sedatives
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.120]   and they don't know that this enhances
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.680]   the respiratory depressing effects of drugs.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.600]   They don't know.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.980]   But when you read these newspaper articles,
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.240]   they don't say this.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.640]   They don't say how to keep people safe.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   All they do is frighten the population.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.480]   There's money in that.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.040]   And then we think about people who write TV shows,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.480]   the people who write movies.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.140]   Most of the stuff written about drugs is just bullshit.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.020]   I think about, I love going to watch comedians
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.260]   and the comedians, when they talk about drugs,
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.580]   again, most of the things that they say about drugs
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.620]   is bullshit.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.660]   I mean, you can say the stupidest things about drugs
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.780]   and be believed.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.820]   You can write a movie
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.740]   and you don't even have to develop your characters
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.820]   if you throw drugs into the mix.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.540]   You say, oh, he's a drug dealer.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.980]   You don't have to say anything
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.220]   about that person's background
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.300]   or about that person being developed as a character
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.540]   because the population think they know.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.040]   And the writer is lazy
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.560]   and does not do any sort of development.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.680]   Just think about any,
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.780]   oh, let's think about "The Sopranos," for example.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.260]   They have a new program coming out.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.340]   So let's think about them for a second.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.300]   "The Sopranos" is a show
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.140]   in which the lead character, Tony,
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.380]   kills people for a living.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.780]   That's what he does, right?
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.940]   This character actually made us sympathetic for him
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.540]   when he is besmirching
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.220]   and denigrating his nephew, Christopher, for using a drug.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.780]   And we feel sympathy for Tony, the character,
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.440]   who just killed somebody,
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.580]   who is a horrible person,
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.820]   but being a drug user is a worse person.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.800]   That's what the show wants us to believe.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.900]   Tony's a racist, a murderer, all of these things,
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.380]   but we feel sympathy for him.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.180]   But we don't feel sympathy for anyone who uses drugs.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.640]   That's some crazy shit.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.420]   I mean, and the American public buys into it.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.100]   That's wild to me, that we all bought into this crap.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.060]   And that's what we do,
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.940]   we condemn everything that's in film, on television.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.020]   And it's like, what's wrong with you people?
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.780]   - So why are there not more stories
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.180]   of grownups using drugs,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.820]   the full spectrum of drugs that we're talking about?
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.660]   Why isn't there?
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.140]   So we talked offline about Joe Rogan.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.580]   He's somebody who started smoking weed later in life,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.660]   which is an interesting story.
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.140]   Like when he's already very successful,
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.420]   and he has a very interesting way
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.260]   of describing his experience with weed,
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.380]   that it was like enhancing his productivity.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.460]   It actually, I think he says,
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.300]   like it increases anxiety a little bit
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.580]   in a way that was productive, like paranoia, not anxiety.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.420]   And so that's an interesting story of an adult
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.980]   talking about the use of weed for productivity purposes.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.800]   But you don't get those stories very often, why?
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.980]   - I think fear, people are afraid
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.700]   that they will be belittled, dismissed,
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.780]   all of these things as a drug addict or some negative thing.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.260]   But cannabis is lightweight, come on.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.660]   You can emit cannabis these days.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.420]   And the fact that, I don't know when Joe started,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.500]   but if he did start later in life, that's cool.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.020]   I mean, you are mature, developed.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.900]   You have developed some responsibility skills,
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.060]   all of these kinds of things.
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.340]   This is a good thing.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.180]   You don't want people to engage in any kind of behaviors
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.300]   when they're young and immature
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.820]   that might put them in harm's way.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.780]   And so we want people to be developed at least.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.780]   I mean, whether it's being in a relationship with a partner,
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.620]   or whether it's driving an automobile,
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.280]   all of these things that can be potentially harmful,
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.920]   but extremely beneficial
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.260]   if you are responsible enough to handle them.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.840]   You want people to be mature, so that's a good thing.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.040]   - So how are you supposed to, like somebody like me,
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   somebody like Joe, how are you supposed to understand
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.360]   what the dangers are, what the negative effects are?
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.340]   So you said automobile, relationships.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.640]   I think I have a reasonably, it's crappy,
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.520]   but reasonable understanding of all the troubles
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.400]   you can get with in relationships,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.840]   and what things to avoid.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.720]   Same thing with driving a car.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.560]   I have no idea, I'm in the dark in terms of
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.920]   what are the things to be careful about,
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.680]   what to avoid with drug use
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.120]   when we're talking about the heavy drugs.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.960]   - Have you ever drank alcohol?
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.320]   - Yes, I'm a rush user. - That's drug use.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.920]   - I know, I drink a lot.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.920]   But I understand that because culture came up.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   I was taught a lot of like, this is what you don't do,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.360]   and this is what you do.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.640]   This is when you drink a lot.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.800]   I mean, you see the effects, you see the,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.320]   there's a lot of negative examples,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.080]   there's positive examples of social stimulant,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.280]   there's examples of great artists using alcohol
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.000]   to sort of, I don't know, to help be the catalyst
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.880]   for that magic moment, for all of that.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.600]   I don't, I have some examples now,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.240]   especially in America, the same with weed.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.080]   More and more, you're starting to get a lot of stories
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.280]   on psychedelics of different kinds.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   There's psilocybin, where you have mushrooms
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.500]   or even MDMA used sort of positively.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.800]   There's kind of like negative stories from the past
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.640]   about acid, about LSD being used,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.840]   ultimately for productive, like for productive ends,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.120]   but it destroyed the person.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.560]   That's kind of how the story goes.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.960]   It was like a trade-off.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.640]   You take, it's like, what is it,
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.840]   Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil to learn guitar.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.880]   Like, it's a trade-off.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.080]   You could take the drug,
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.240]   you're gonna create some good stuff,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.480]   but you have to pay for it.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.320]   Those are the stories.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.080]   - Yeah, that's some bullshit we tell children.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.200]   Come on.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.360]   That's exactly right.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.420]   You're exactly right.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.840]   These fairy tales, these cautionary tales
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.900]   that we tell people, we have to grow up.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.440]   That's what the book is about, drug use for grownups.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   We tell people, Pinocchio, if you lie, your nose grow.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.240]   Who believes that?
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.800]   Who believes that there are fairy tales?
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.880]   But that's exactly what these stories are.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.140]   They're in the same vein as those kind of stories,
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.400]   as Pinocchio.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   Like you said, when you were learning about alcohol,
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.280]   you were told what to do, what not to do, so forth.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.680]   The same can be true with MDMA, with cocaine, with heroin.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.360]   The same is true because there are some times
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.320]   when there are some potential dangers that you should avoid.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.940]   And I wrote about some of them,
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.520]   certainly in my work just throughout all of my writings.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.880]   I talk about those kinds of things
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.120]   and other people talk about these things.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.920]   The problem is, is that we're getting our education
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.600]   from bullshit sources,
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.180]   from people who believe in this kind of Pinocchio thing.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.480]   And it just does not fit with the evidence.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.920]   And the evidence, we all publish
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.280]   in the scientific literature.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.520]   All these things that I'm saying,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.200]   it's there in the literature.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.160]   I mean, at a place like Columbia,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   we give these drugs thousands of doses every year.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.200]   Do you think we would be doing this?
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.600]   And we do this with research grants
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.780]   that's funded by the public, taxpayers' dollars.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.640]   Do you think we would be allowed to do this
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.440]   if these drugs were so dangerous?
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.280]   It's just nonsense.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.720]   I mean, and the drugs we're talking about,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   they are all approved for medical use
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.360]   somewhere in the world.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.280]   - And the studies you conduct
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.920]   are basically asking what kinds of questions.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.600]   So you take the full range of drugs you're talking about,
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.680]   from marijuana to psilocybin to MDMA
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.140]   to cocaine and heroin.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.480]   What is the study looking at?
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.800]   Like what the actual experience
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.100]   with the positive and negative effects
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.680]   of the experience on the drug are in control conditions?
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.320]   - Yeah, so we did these kind of experiments
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.200]   with alcohol, nicotine, all these drugs
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.240]   in order to have an empirical database
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.160]   to tell people exactly what these drugs do
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.440]   and what they don't do.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.960]   The conditions under which the drugs
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.600]   will produce positive effects,
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.440]   the conditions under which the drugs
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.080]   were more likely to produce negative effects.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.280]   All of this information is important
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.720]   for a society to know, and we do know.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.360]   And that's why we're collecting the data.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.300]   We're collecting the data to help us with treatment
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.800]   if someone is having problems with these data.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.040]   Hopefully we'll understand more about
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.340]   how to help them deal with their problems
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.560]   based on some of the research that we're doing.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.920]   - So what kind of negative effects
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.080]   are we looking out for?
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.060]   Like what are the properties of drugs
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.120]   we should be careful about?
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.760]   Is it addictive properties?
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.600]   How addictive it is?
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.600]   How destructive or painful, whatever,
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.960]   the withdrawal processes?
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.140]   What kind of things are we looking out for?
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.800]   - Yeah, those are certain kind of questions
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   we certainly have asked because something like
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.840]   crack cocaine versus alcohol or heroin
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.600]   when it comes to withdrawal or physical dependence.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.960]   Like cocaine has a very limited sort of withdrawal symptoms.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.760]   I mean, it's hard to see.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.080]   Same is true with methamphetamine.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.920]   But with heroin, you certainly can see
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.440]   a withdrawal syndrome that's unpleasant.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.080]   But with alcohol, that withdrawal can actually kill you.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.480]   So heroin is unpleasant and not lovely,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.620]   but with alcohol withdrawal, that's the one,
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.840]   that's the most dangerous.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.640]   I mean, all of these kind of questions
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.320]   we wanna know answers to.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.440]   And so when we think about heroin or some other drugs
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.880]   and you say like, what kind of negative effects?
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.920]   Negative effects, we don't talk about much in the society.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.800]   The main thing that really concerns me
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.260]   about like heroin use really is constipation.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:11.200]   So if people are using heroin on a regular basis
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   and then they have a sort of slowing of their gut motility,
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.360]   they're likely to increase constipation.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.960]   And that's not good, I mean, for your general health.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.680]   But we never talk about that in this society.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.840]   And that's probably the most important thing
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.000]   aside from the fact that people get contaminated
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.480]   street drugs and that sort of stuff
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.760]   and increase the likelihood of maybe dying
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.200]   from some contaminant or people who are inexperienced
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.600]   and they're mixing heroin with other sedative.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.840]   That's not good, but the constipation is a huge one.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.100]   And then other sort of drugs, negative effects,
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.400]   like the amphetamines, all of the amphetamines,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.860]   they disrupt sleep, food intake.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.480]   All of these things are so critical
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.600]   for sustaining human life.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.960]   But we never talk about that
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.880]   because it's not as sexy as this nonsense
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.120]   that people write about, like addiction.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.080]   Addiction has almost nothing to do
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.480]   with the drugs themselves.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   And I make that comment because the vast majority of users
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.760]   for any drug never become addicted.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.040]   And so if the vast majority of users don't become addicted,
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.200]   then you have to move beyond the drug
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.560]   when you're talking about the phenomena interest,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.320]   in this case, addiction.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.540]   And so when we think about addiction,
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.080]   it has much more to do with our psychosocial environment
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.520]   than the drug itself, but that's not sexy.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.260]   - So addiction is even the property of the environment,
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.320]   not a property, a result of the environment.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   - It certainly can be.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.760]   There are people who are suffering
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.760]   from a co-occurring mental illness,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.800]   like depression, anxiety.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.400]   I mean, that's within the person, of course,
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.920]   and that increases the likelihood for addiction.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.420]   So that's not so much the environment,
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.600]   but there are people who, for example,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.760]   they have chronic unrealistic expectations heaped on them.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   And those people are more likely
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.960]   to have some problems with drugs.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.320]   There are people who are just immature,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.240]   not developed, haven't developed responsibility skills.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.600]   They are likely to have some problems
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   if they engage in some of these behaviors.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.160]   There are people who lost their jobs,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.040]   COVID, factories went away, a wide range of things.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.540]   And those people used to have standing in their community.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.520]   Now they have none.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.680]   Those people might be susceptible
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.620]   to having a drug-related problem
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.240]   if they indulge.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.880]   All of these kind of issues
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.520]   are far more important than the drug itself.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.560]   - And so they could seek escape in a particular drug.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.320]   I mean, there is a biochemical thing
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.400]   to each of these drugs,
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.280]   and some pull you in harder than others
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.960]   when you need the escape, right?
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.880]   When you're not doing well in life.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.200]   - What evidence you have for that, Boosh?
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.040]   - I don't.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.000]   - Yeah, 'cause there is none.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.760]   There is absolutely none.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.800]   I mean, people say stuff like that,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.520]   and that's the problem.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.460]   That's precisely the problem.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.840]   - See, I'm operating from limited personal evidence.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.180]   - Well, this is a problem, though,
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.680]   but we have a scientific database.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.320]   We don't need personal evidence for this.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.600]   In my book, I try to go through some of the science
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.480]   so people could understand.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.840]   It's like when you have a math problem,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.880]   you don't want people saying,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.760]   "Well, you know, I feel like this."
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.960]   Fuck what you feel.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.940]   What does the data say?
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.460]   - So one of the problems with the data,
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.840]   so one data is there's the studies that you're doing.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.280]   This is excellent research work,
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.600]   but there's some of the drugs are illegal.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.100]   - Yes. - And some are legal.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.320]   So you have just, it's unfortunate
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.200]   that some of the drugs are illegal,
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.960]   or whatever you believe,
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.640]   but there's not enough of a data set
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.840]   of public and the open use.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.480]   That's like you got in the wild data set.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.960]   It'd be nice to do thousands of people
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.120]   and see from all the different kinds of environments
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.580]   and all that kind of stuff to get an understanding.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.300]   - I think we have a substantial database,
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.380]   but people just ignore it.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.220]   - Got it.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.480]   That said, let me ask you the question of legalization.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.260]   So should, in your view, all drugs be legalized?
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.980]   - The drugs that people seek
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.500]   certainly should be legally regulated
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.420]   and available to adults.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.020]   So when I say the drugs people seek,
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.140]   like cannabis, MDMA, cocaine, heroin,
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.300]   those drugs certainly should be available,
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.500]   and some of the psychedelics that people seek.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:50.500]   Now, the thing about it is that some people think that,
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.340]   oh, it'll be a free fall.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.260]   These drugs are available to everyone.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.140]   That's not true.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.900]   I mean, it will be, there will be age requirements
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.540]   and maybe other requirements,
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.340]   but they should be available.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.700]   And we should also do like what we do with alcohol.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.420]   We can put enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you,
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.500]   but we don't.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.060]   So we regulate it such that the amount that's in the bottle
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.460]   enhances the safety and minimizes the potential harms.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.740]   We can do the same thing with these other drugs.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.060]   And we can also say, okay,
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.180]   we won't be selling intravenous preparations
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.860]   of any of these drugs.
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.540]   These, the drugs that the routes of administration
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:36.540]   will be oral and I don't know, let's say intranasal.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.900]   Again, routes of administration,
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.820]   the dose that you have in each unit,
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:49.260]   all can minimize harm based on how you do these things.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.100]   And we can do that.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.300]   We have the technology, we have the know-how.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.100]   - You're actually making me think
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.140]   about alcohol a little bit.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.820]   So if I were, say the drugs become legalized
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.220]   in the way you're describing,
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.500]   and me, Lex, wanted to, as an adult,
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.420]   explore some of these drugs,
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:10.140]   what are some procedures do you think
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.940]   for sort of safe, positive exploration of those drugs?
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.900]   The reason I say I'm thinking about alcohol,
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.660]   because I don't think besides not putting enough alcohol
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.460]   in a bottle to kill you,
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.820]   I don't think anyone ever gave me specific instructions.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.300]   I think it's kind of word of mouth
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.900]   and examples of people doing the wrong thing.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.100]   You kind of get it through osmosis that way.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.020]   - Yeah.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.300]   - Is that basically what we would do?
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.220]   This kind of free exploration of use?
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.300]   - No, we have to change our education about these things.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.220]   I mean, let's just take a drug like cocaine.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.540]   Cocaine's a stimulant.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.940]   You wanna make sure people understand
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.380]   that they shouldn't be taking cocaine near bedtime.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.980]   You know, they need to get a certain amount of hours
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.380]   of sleep and they need to get up in the morning.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.980]   Cocaine probably isn't a drug for you at night.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.820]   Certainly not.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.580]   Certainly not amphetamines at night for most people.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.820]   And also, if you wanna make sure that you,
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.500]   they need to understand that cocaine
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.780]   can also disrupt your food intake.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.260]   Not as much as the amphetamines,
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.780]   but all of these kinds of things people need to know
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.420]   so they can have proper nutrition
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.460]   and they can time their drug use
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.540]   around these other important functions
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.860]   that sustain human life.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.940]   So we have to make sure that we educate people.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.380]   We can't just throw people in a while.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.140]   That's stupid.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.900]   - I gotta tell you, I mean, for me,
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.420]   and even given your book and for people listening to this,
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.180]   it's still tough to hear that the thing
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.700]   we should be concerned about with cocaine
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.580]   is the same as with caffeine.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.100]   Don't take it before bed.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.500]   And the thing we should be concerned with heroin
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.460]   is constipation.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.300]   - Yeah.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.460]   - Okay.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.820]   But the questions I keep wanting to ask you,
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.860]   I should be asking the same things of alcohol.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.780]   But when you're not doing well psychologically
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.780]   in the ways you described, when the environment's not right,
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:19.340]   there's some aspect in which saying that
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.540]   drugs can be used responsibly and effectively
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   and mostly positive can give those folks a pass
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.620]   to use it instead of working on themselves
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.860]   and fixing their environment first.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.260]   - I don't know, what do you want me to say to that?
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.300]   I mean, they have access to alcohol.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.660]   They have access to the...
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.900]   You know, we live in this country called the United States
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.380]   where our Declaration of Independence says that
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.420]   we are free to live like we wanna live
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.420]   so long as we don't disrupt other people from doing the same.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.660]   But it's remarkable to me how we try to control
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.140]   the behaviors of other people.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.740]   That's just remarkable.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.780]   - Yeah.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.900]   And that's partially what your book is about.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.460]   I mean, it's not just about drugs, it's about freedom.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.180]   - That's the bigger issue that we can't get to.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.380]   It's like this issue of freedom.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.060]   And freedom comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.300]   I am responsible for my neighbors,
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.940]   my brothers, I mean, I can't impede their freedoms.
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.940]   Like some people think that their freedom
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.780]   supersedes everybody else's freedoms.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.020]   No, and that's what I'm trying to remind people in this book.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.020]   I am responsible to you as a citizen
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.620]   and we're in this together.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.020]   And I tried to make that point in the book
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.480]   and people have conveniently ignored things like that.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.700]   - Do you think the war on drugs
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.500]   has done more positive or negative for the world?
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.540]   - Depends on which world you live in.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.820]   The war on drugs has been hugely beneficial
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.740]   to law enforcement, to the media,
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.520]   to people who make bullshit TV shows,
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.220]   the Sopranos, The Wire, all of those shows,
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.800]   they benefit from this kind of nonsense.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.100]   Who else have benefited?
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.780]   People who provide treatment,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.860]   many of them benefit from the war on drugs.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.500]   The folks who do urine testing for drugs,
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.980]   they've all benefited, they're making mad money.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.260]   People who run prisons,
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.340]   the phone companies who charge the prisoners,
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.660]   the people who run the hotels that are around the prisons
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.340]   where people's family have to come and stay,
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.820]   the restaurants, they are making out like bandits.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.980]   But many of us are getting screwed as a society.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.460]   In general, we're getting screwed,
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.980]   but there are people who are just benefiting handsomely.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.340]   That's why it continues.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.020]   Politicians benefit.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.340]   I mean, whether you're Democrat or Republican,
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.680]   you have the same stance on drugs anyway,
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.860]   so they all benefit from this.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.540]   - So many questions I wanna ask you
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.780]   'cause you're challenging a lot of beliefs that people have
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.140]   about drugs, about society in general.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.100]   So it's difficult for me to ask the right questions here.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:23.020]   If you were with a sort of a snap of a finger,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.140]   change the world, what from a policy perspective,
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.300]   would you, and from just a, I don't know,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.020]   human to human perspective,
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.140]   what would you like to see in the United States of America
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.780]   in terms of that fixes some of the problems
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.900]   we're discussing here?
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.900]   - First of all, I would not,
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.820]   we wouldn't be arresting anybody for drugs anymore.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.080]   That would go away.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.320]   The folks who are in prison for drugs, that would go away.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.940]   Their records would be a sponge.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.740]   That would just go away.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.540]   And then we work on a system to make sure
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.540]   that responsible adults can legally obtain these substances,
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.720]   and we'll have a corresponding educational system
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.360]   to teach people how to do this.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.100]   That's where I would start initially.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.660]   - Yeah, the arresting for drug use
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.460]   or anything drug-related is absurd,
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.460]   especially in the context of how destructive
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.960]   alcohol is and tobacco.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.020]   - Alcohol can be destructive to some people,
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.620]   but alcohol also is a hugely beneficial drug,
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.300]   to be honest, which I couldn't have gotten through
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.300]   many of the sort of receptions and functions
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.660]   I had to go through as the chair of the department
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.500]   without alcohol.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.100]   - Yeah, you have a line I really liked.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.580]   The vast amount of predictably favorable drug effects
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.880]   intrigued me, so much so that I expanded my own drug use
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.380]   to take advantage of the wide array of beneficial outcomes
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.360]   specific drugs can offer.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.620]   The part that entertained me was this.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.140]   To put this in personal terms,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.580]   my position as department chairman from 2016 to 2019
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.540]   was far more detrimental to my health
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.340]   than my drug use ever was.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.460]   I mean, there is a standard where treating drugs,
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.180]   certain kinds of drugs that's completely different
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:11.020]   than the standard we're treating
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.460]   everything else in our lives.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:17.100]   Yeah, I mean, it's almost difficult to snap out of it
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.860]   as I'm listening to you and reading your work.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:27.100]   It's difficult because it's like,
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.860]   why is everybody living this idea that certain drugs
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.620]   are so horribly destructive and others are not?
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.780]   And we just kind of fix that idea.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.380]   And then there's this narrative.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.660]   I hate to be so cynical to think that there is just
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.380]   like a system that just propagates narratives.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.300]   I always kind of think that truth wins out.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.540]   Truth is the best narrative.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.340]   - I believe that too, obviously, that's why I'm out here
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.700]   and putting, subjecting myself to this sort of criticism
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.340]   and so forth, but because I believe that truth
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.900]   ultimately wins out, but I might be wrong.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.860]   But I have to live my life like it's true.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.820]   Otherwise, then I have no hope.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.260]   Then why be here?
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.900]   - Well, kind of, if you can steal man
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.580]   or at least show respect to a criticism,
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.740]   you've I'm sure received quite a bit of criticism
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.700]   for your work.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.780]   I've heard quite a bit of BS criticism,
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.100]   sort of ignorance, stuff that don't actually pay attention
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.260]   to your work, but is there some serious,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.220]   like is there some pushback that makes you think twice?
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.660]   - People say like I'm presenting a too rosy picture
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.340]   of drugs, like I don't wanna do that.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.300]   I don't want people to think that I'm not aware
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.340]   of the potential negative effects of any activity,
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.260]   including drug use.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:56.260]   And so I do acknowledge that there are potential harms
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.620]   associated with drugs.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.180]   I acknowledge that in the book.
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.580]   But the fact remains the beneficial effects far outweigh
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.420]   the potential harmful effects.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.740]   And we have technology information to help people
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.180]   to minimize the likelihood of those negative effects.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.340]   But this sort of approach that we have,
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:19.340]   where we say we're only exclusively presenting
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.460]   the harmful effects and that should make people,
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.620]   keep people safe.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.460]   I just have a problem with that.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.460]   But I certainly, I take the point that people say
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.220]   there are negative effects.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.140]   Absolutely, I absolutely agree.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.220]   - What do you, if I can just talk about specific drugs,
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.900]   what's the difference between opioids and benzos,
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.900]   for example, specifically, I mean, these are drugs
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:53.140]   that you often read about being misused at scale.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.180]   I mean, the misuse is the problem, right?
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.140]   - Yeah.
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.540]   - No matter what the drug is.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.380]   - Yes.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.820]   - And that's actually what you're pushing for is education.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.780]   And it should be legal and should be good.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.460]   So people should know what's the difference
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.460]   in proper use, positive use and misuse.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.020]   I mean, one public figure who has been going through this
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.380]   is Jordan Peterson.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.700]   He's been public about his struggle of getting off benzos,
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.540]   the withdrawal he's going through.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.380]   I mean, what are your thoughts about
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:27.300]   the misuse of benzos or opioids and so on,
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.060]   the epidemic that people talk about?
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.260]   - Yeah, I don't know Jordan's specific case,
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.140]   but certainly with benzodiazepines in general,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.740]   we talked about withdrawal earlier
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.180]   when I said that with alcohol withdrawal, you can die.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.540]   So benzos and alcohol, they're closely related.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.380]   So benzo withdrawal too can kill you, just like alcohol.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.220]   So when we think about the effects
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.340]   that benzodiazepines produce,
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.460]   think about the effects that alcohol produce.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.740]   They're comparable or similar.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.740]   And so I know that it's a difficult one to wean yourself off
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.440]   if you develop the dependence,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   but we have protocols for that and I hope he's okay.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.300]   - Since you say we have protocols for that,
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.620]   but from my understanding was that
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.140]   like the protocols aren't standardized.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.060]   It feels like a lot of doctors aren't as helpful
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.820]   as they could be in this process.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.300]   Like it's a bit of a mess.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.940]   - Certainly with withdrawal,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.060]   they're more standardized than anything.
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.620]   So like if someone is going through alcohol withdrawal,
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.620]   there is a standard protocol that most physicians
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.100]   in this business, they follow.
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.500]   The same is true with benzo withdrawal.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.580]   But the thing where it gets murky
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.140]   is when they're treating addiction itself.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.860]   So when you're thinking about the substance use disorder
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.340]   in the DSM, not just withdrawal, but the entire addiction,
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.340]   that's where you have this sort of divergence
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:39:00.700]   or diversity in terms of approaches.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.680]   And many of those approaches are rubbish.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.880]   - What, can you just elaborate like technically
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.800]   what the term addiction means that you're referring to?
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.220]   - When I use the term addiction,
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   I'm referring to the Diagnostics Statistical Manual
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.100]   of the American Psychiatric Association, number five now,
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.180]   the DSM-5.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.820]   - That's never been wrong, right?
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.300]   I'm just kidding.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.140]   - You're absolutely, that point is well taken.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.100]   And your point is that their definition
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.380]   of substance use disorder, that's addiction,
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.580]   that's what I'm talking about.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.700]   But that definition continues to evolve.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.140]   And so you're right, they still are working it out.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.580]   We're getting new information
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.900]   from scientific studies and so forth.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.540]   And so it's supposed to be incorporated into the DSM.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.940]   But there are some problems with the DSM.
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.980]   Like for example, they also have this sort of
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.560]   once an addict, always an addict thing,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.780]   and there's no evidence to support that.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:07.600]   But it's evolving, and it's the definition
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.900]   that people in science and medicine use.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.860]   And so we all know we're talking about the same language
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.620]   when we call someone a substance use disorder patient
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.700]   or someone who meets criteria for addiction.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.200]   We all are speaking the same language.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.900]   We're not saying that simply
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.580]   because this person use heroin, they are an addict.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.020]   That's not what we're saying.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.940]   You have to meet these criteria
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.140]   where you have disruptions
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.300]   in your psychosocial functioning, that's one.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.440]   And two, you, the person, are distressed
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.160]   by these disruptions.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.520]   So people have to meet those two basic criteria
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.680]   before we say they are addicted.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.280]   - So once an addict, always an addict, this idea.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.760]   I mean, some of it is always mapped to the person,
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.720]   but just the people I've interacted with
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.080]   who have struggled with alcohol addiction,
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.380]   I don't know what the proper term is.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.060]   It seems like with Alcohol Anonymous,
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:14.060]   the process of putting that addiction behind you
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.980]   is a very, very long process.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.820]   It's surprisingly long to me.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.660]   That almost seems like a whole life.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.220]   Like it's not always an addict, but it takes decades.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.060]   It seems like.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.460]   What is that?
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:32.140]   Can you maybe just, from your understanding as a scientist,
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.340]   from your understanding as a human
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:34.880]   who studies human nature,
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.800]   why does it take so long to treat,
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:42.900]   to deal with that addiction?
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.560]   - Well, you cited Alcohol Anonymous, right?
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.600]   And so I don't think of Alcohol Anonymous
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.400]   as like a treatment that I would send any relative to,
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.600]   like for a drug-related problem.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.760]   I think Alcohol Anonymous AA is really good
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.240]   for social interactions,
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   making sure people have a social group and they have peers.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.920]   I mean, that's a good thing.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.720]   We all need that social interaction,
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.760]   but I don't think they know much about drugs.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.160]   That's not, it's like saying,
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.760]   well, you know, my uncle broke his knee
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.380]   and he has this support group and they said this,
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.840]   and then we follow that.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.960]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   But in our society, judges even sentence people to go to AA.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.640]   Are you kidding me?
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.800]   But that's the kind of thing
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.780]   that has been allowed to happen in this society
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:50.560]   because we think of drugs as this moral failing,
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.220]   or drug addiction as this moral failing.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.560]   And any idiot can provide treatment.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.740]   And no disrespect to AA because I think what they do
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.880]   is a lot more than what some people do
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:07.480]   because at least they have these social interactions,
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.700]   you have a social group.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.520]   That's better than what a lot of these other idiots
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.640]   out here do.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.520]   - Well, and that social support group,
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.420]   unrelated to the drug,
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.680]   it helps cure some of the environment issues you might be in.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.960]   That's the whole point.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.120]   So we kind of coupled the drug to the environment,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.400]   but the reality is, as you argue,
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.980]   most of the problems come from the environment.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.940]   - Certainly with people who are experiencing
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.800]   drug-related problem with most of the people,
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.840]   not all, but most.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.820]   - There are differences like that psychedelics
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.940]   and like psilocybin has versus alcohol.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:45.260]   I personally think,
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:50.340]   I've enjoyed both experiences in different ways.
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.980]   Is it possible, or are we getting into the realm of poetry
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.540]   to describe the benefits,
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.520]   like how it alters the mind,
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.040]   how the different drugs alter the mind
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.020]   and the places it can take you
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.840]   that produce a positive experience?
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.700]   - Yeah.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.140]   No, it's very real.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.820]   You know, like some drugs take people in places
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.060]   that other drugs can't, and that's very real.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.340]   I have friends, some of them you know,
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.580]   they, for example, say that they've never had an experience
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.820]   like the one they had with ayahuasca,
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.240]   and they've done a number of sort of things.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.180]   But they did the ayahuasca in a setting
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:40.420]   with a shaman and this group,
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.420]   and they felt like they actually began to heal
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.540]   or solve some problems that they were trying to solve
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.260]   for some years, and that's great.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.020]   That's great for them.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.620]   And nothing else does it for them like that.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.140]   And that's absolutely fantastic.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:05.820]   All I argue is that if that kind of thing happens for you
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.700]   with ayahuasca, with psilocybin,
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.500]   with some other psychedelic,
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:17.060]   why isn't it possible that heroin does that for someone
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.780]   or cocaine does that for someone else,
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.700]   or MDMA does it for someone?
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.540]   That's it.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.420]   - That's interesting to imagine like a shaman for heroin.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.940]   Like why not?
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.180]   And or cocaine, you said creating an environment
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.100]   for yourself for use of these different substances,
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:39.100]   and that environment has a very strong impact
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.860]   on the actual experience that you have.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.860]   But I mean, so cocaine is an upper, and then--
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.980]   - Yeah, the way we define drugs like uppers and downers,
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:55.980]   that's a really kind of inappropriate way,
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.500]   but it's a quick way.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.140]   So we certainly say cocaine is an upper or stimulant.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.300]   But it depends on the activity of the person
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.380]   before they take the drug.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.460]   Say like if you're like really active
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.740]   before taking a drug like cocaine,
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.820]   it might actually calm you.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.620]   So it all depends on the activity of the person
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:16.900]   before they take the drug.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.820]   - I remember, I don't know if you know Matthew Johnson is--
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:20.660]   - Of course.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.060]   - He did all these studies on,
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.260]   or I remember just reading a paper,
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.260]   I didn't get a chance to talk with him much about it,
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.780]   but it was about condom use and cocaine.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.300]   And then, you know, what like the doses
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.700]   and whether people are more or less likely,
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:40.540]   like the unsafe thing there is the using or not using,
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:45.540]   or not using, I guess, condoms during sexual intercourse.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.220]   I don't know, I just, I love that these drugs
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   that have connotation probably because of Hollywood,
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.740]   negative connotations are actually being studied by science
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:56.620]   and then the actual impact they have
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.180]   and what are the negative effects.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.240]   Again, in those studies often,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:05.340]   the positive effects are difficult to quantify, I think.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.300]   Maybe, I guess you can from self-report and so on.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.340]   - The positive effects are not difficult to quantify.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:15.420]   You ask people about their euphoria,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.260]   you can see how well people are getting along.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:22.780]   Like in our studies that we have people sometimes in groups
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.740]   and you see how well they get along
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.960]   on the various drug conditions or placebo conditions.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.460]   It's really, it's not that difficult.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.620]   - And then you can see these amazing studies
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:38.180]   with like Rick Doblin, like looking at MDMA
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.800]   and combined with therapy,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.020]   like how you can overcome certain PTSD things
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.140]   or depression and so on.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.500]   Yeah, it's really interesting.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.100]   It's really interesting.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.460]   I gotta ask you, 'cause you mentioned The Wire.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.300]   Do you think The Wire, you think movies like "Trainspotting",
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.140]   do you think they're ultimately destructive?
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:02.200]   'Cause okay, yes, they celebrate murder, right?
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.300]   The Godfather a little bit.
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.140]   - Yeah.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.280]   - But another one, I mean,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.120]   it's like these racist ass motherfuckers
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.660]   and they also are killing people,
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.780]   but yet they say, "We don't do drugs."
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.060]   What kind of shit is that?
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:21.060]   I mean, people who are doing drugs, psilocybin or whatever,
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.540]   the thing is we're trying to be better people
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.140]   and trying to make our society better
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.220]   and you're killing people
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:32.340]   and you are denigrating people for using drugs.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.500]   Are you fucking kidding me?
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.980]   And we let them get away with that as a society.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.220]   - Do you see those movies,
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.740]   I apologize if I'm not sufficiently informed,
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.800]   do you see them as denigrating drugs?
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.640]   - Of course.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.760]   I mean, The Godfather.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.600]   - Yes, that's right.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.420]   That's a good example.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.500]   - The Godfather, The Sopranos is all about that.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.660]   I mean, Christopher is using heroin in The Sopranos
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:58.500]   and they have an intervention in one season
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.940]   and they are denigrating him.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.780]   Are you kidding me?
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.740]   You just cut somebody's head off.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.940]   - Yeah, but to be fair,
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.580]   they were denigrating, I think, all drugs.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.180]   - And then they're drinking alcohol in the Butterbean.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:14.860]   - Come on.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.180]   I mean, first of all, they're killing people.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.340]   They don't have any space, none,
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.820]   to denigrate somebody who's just trying
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:26.540]   to alter their consciousness.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   Are you kidding me?
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.620]   And not bothering anyone else.
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.440]   - But there's a lot of other mob movies
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.980]   that Scarface celebrates the murder and the drugs equally.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:40.980]   So, I mean, it celebrates all of the,
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.420]   not just drugs or so on.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.820]   It's extreme. - All of those movies.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:48.020]   I loved all those movies.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:48.860]   I'm from Miami.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.100]   I loved Scarface.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.620]   I even liked The Sopranos.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.860]   Then I started looking at that shit with a critical eye
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.260]   and see what it's doing.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:01.540]   But Scarface is dependent upon the American viewer
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:06.300]   having a certain view of people who deal in drugs.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:10.620]   And that view is that these people are animals, basically.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.060]   And in the end, the animal kills himself
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.780]   with too much cocaine and he was high.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.940]   That's what they show.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.740]   And so it's like, what the fuck?
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.580]   - So it's leveraging, it's playing into
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.080]   not the better angels of our nature.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:31.900]   - The question--
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.140]   - Don't take away these great movies from me.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:34.980]   But it's true.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.940]   You have to think about them critically in this context.
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.860]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:39.700]   I like these movies.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.180]   It's not a matter of taking away.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.980]   It's a matter of making the writers
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.020]   be more honest to the reality.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:47.860]   That's it.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:48.700]   - That's true.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.520]   That's really true.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.140]   And the writers, the people, the culture, all of it.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.300]   - I mean, they write these things.
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.060]   I just think about some hip hop artists.
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.620]   They say, "This is real.
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.300]   "This is my experience," and so forth.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.020]   And that's how these movie writers,
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.340]   they write this bullshit and then say, "Well, this is real."
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.500]   Anyway, I get so upset talking about it
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.980]   because I know the harm it's doing.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.260]   And I know those kind of movies are the reason
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.860]   that we have this war on drugs.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.420]   And all of these people are going to jail
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.220]   because of those kind of movies.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:28.420]   - In the epilogue of your book, you quote James Baldwin.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.120]   "You cannot know what you will discover on the journey,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.540]   "what you will do with what you find,
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.660]   "or what you find will do to you."
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.980]   So let me ask, how has drug use
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.940]   or the study of drugs changed you as a human being?
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.860]   - It has helped me think about
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.580]   other people's experience, right?
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.420]   So how we're all connected.
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.100]   Like going to Northern Ireland,
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.540]   I don't know if you know much about the situation
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.060]   with the troubles and what those people went through.
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.820]   And so I see people there.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.300]   Northern Ireland, by the way, is all white.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.900]   And you see those people there suffering
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:08.260]   for the same reasons that people in Appalachia
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.940]   are suffering for.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:14.700]   Neglected by politicians who told them lies about drugs
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.620]   and not dealing with the real problems,
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.060]   like West Virginia, for example.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.500]   Their water's polluted, the factories have gone away,
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.980]   people are desperate, and they're blaming drugs?
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.600]   Are you kidding me?
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.420]   So the politicians don't have to bring back the jobs,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.340]   so we don't have to really make sure
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.380]   they have clean drinking water, things of that nature.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.380]   And so those people are connected
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.700]   to the people in Northern Ireland.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.660]   They're connected to the people in Brownsville.
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.840]   They're connected to the people in other places
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.100]   in the United States for the same reason.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:54.100]   They're connected to the people in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:58.340]   Same thing, people are catching hell for the same reason.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.180]   In the Philippines, for the same reason.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.980]   And that's why I feel so strongly about this thing,
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.660]   because I know there are people getting paid,
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:13.260]   and their paycheck is predicated on subjugating
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.260]   and the suffering of those other people.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:21.980]   - So when we hear about the destructive effects of drugs,
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.980]   it's essentially a scapegoat for the failures of leaders
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:31.000]   and politicians to help alleviate the suffering
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.060]   of people in those communities.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.620]   - Absolutely, it's so easy to say,
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.860]   I'm gonna rid your community of drugs,
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.760]   I'm gonna put more cops on the street.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:45.060]   If you want a problem not to be solved,
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.360]   just give it to the military or the cops.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.420]   - You had a tough childhood growing up in Miami,
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.820]   like you said.
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:55.180]   What memories, memory stands out in particular
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:59.320]   that was formative in helping make you the man you are?
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.120]   - That's so hard to say.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.720]   My grandmother was really important.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.380]   So maybe just her, trying to make sure
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.700]   that I think critically, I guess that's the biggest one.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.300]   - So you moved in with her, your parents split?
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.860]   - Six, seven, yeah.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.620]   - What have you learned about life from her?
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:28.420]   - Be self-sufficient, be critical, and keep your eyes open,
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.460]   and watch out for the okey-doke.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.540]   You know, and that's what this whole drug thing is about.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.260]   It's the okey-doke people.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:40.220]   It really boils down to just simple thing.
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.900]   We're all similar in that we're all just trying
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.340]   to live our life, trying to take care of our kids.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:48.780]   We want the best for our kids, all of us.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:53.780]   But yet, somehow, we've been made to believe
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.760]   that we're different in that way.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.700]   But fundamentally, we're all the same.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:02.980]   So when people are seeking to feel pleasure,
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.900]   to feel better, why don't we celebrate that?
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.580]   Instead, we denigrate people for that.
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:15.460]   I mean, if I feel better, I'm more likely to treat you well.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:21.620]   - I gotta say, still though, you're going against the grain,
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.800]   and you're at Columbia.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.060]   It takes a lot of guts to sort of speak out
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.320]   about these ideas so boldly.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:33.860]   I don't know how to ask this question.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.420]   Where do you find the guts?
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.980]   'Cause it's also perhaps inspirational to others
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:43.260]   in different disciplines that are sort of taking
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:47.420]   on the conventional wisdom of the day and challenging it.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.580]   What does it take to do that?
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.420]   What advice would you give to others
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:54.260]   like you, kind of a little bit afraid to do so?
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:57.900]   - Once you know, you cannot not know, as they say.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.620]   And so I have to look in the mirror.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:03.340]   And then looking in the mirror, I have to face myself.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.500]   Have I lived honestly?
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:10.500]   And if I can't face myself, then what am I doing here?
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:16.100]   That's how I see it.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.060]   One of the things that people don't really talk about
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:24.780]   with drugs and people who die from drug-related death,
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:28.300]   and I've been thinking about this a whole lot
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:29.820]   over the past couple of years,
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:34.220]   it's like some of these drugs can take you to a place
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:38.620]   where you feel so optimistic and positive about humans,
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:42.860]   our fellow humans, and you want to do your best
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:46.980]   to contribute because you know the possibilities
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:49.380]   of what we can be as a society.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.820]   And then you come up with resistance
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.740]   and like you say, there's a lot of resistance
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.220]   and people just have a hard time.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:04.220]   And so if you know humans can be better
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:06.220]   and they refuse to be better,
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:10.420]   why be here as someone who knows
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.700]   that we can do this better?
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.140]   I certainly don't want to do it the way we're doing it.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:20.260]   - So you kind of see drugs as mechanisms
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.340]   for potentially elevating the human spirit,
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.060]   sort of making people feel better
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.620]   so you want to communicate that message.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:32.620]   So it's that plus the fact that drugs are used as scapegoat
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:37.180]   to not alleviate the suffering of certain communities.
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.580]   So those two things-
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:42.100]   - One of the sort of main points of the book too
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.220]   was to try and get people to understand
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.620]   possibilities that we could have
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:53.100]   if we embraced certain drug use,
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:57.340]   if we allowed adults to do this sort of thing.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.260]   Relationships can be better,
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:04.780]   wide range of beneficial effects.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:09.580]   People would be or can learn to be more magnanimous.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.900]   All of these pro-social things that we say we value.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.100]   - In your previous book, "High Price,"
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.420]   you talk about rap and DJing, chapter five.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:25.540]   There's a nice picture of you DJing from 1983.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.580]   So let me ask, who in your view,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.980]   this is the toughest question of this interview,
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.020]   is the greatest hip hop artist of all time?
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.380]   Maybe give some candidates.
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.900]   - Oh, wow, who is the greatest hip hop artist?
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:40.300]   I don't know if I'm qualified to make that bet
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.020]   because you know,
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.660]   I have to go back to like Gil Scott Heron.
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:49.700]   You know, like people think of him
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.660]   as one of the fathers of hip hop.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.940]   That's my all time favorite.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:58.780]   And people like Chuck D from Public Enemy,
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:00.540]   some of the things that they were doing,
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.980]   I was really digging,
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:06.420]   but even though I was digging like Public Enemy,
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.980]   but even they got it wrong on drugs.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:12.260]   Even Gil Scott Heron got it wrong on drugs,
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.380]   but they were doing so much other good stuff.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.860]   It helped me to develop as a person.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:25.820]   And so I think like my son is a hip hop artist now.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:31.900]   I think those folks who are in the game now,
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.540]   they might be, they are a lot more qualified
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.500]   to talk about who's the greatest hip hop artist.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.860]   I'm not qualified.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:41.300]   - The evolution, I mean, have you tracked the evolution
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.860]   from sort of the nineties with Wu Tang and Tupac and Biggie
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.180]   and then to what we have today?
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.820]   So there's just been a crazy amount of progress.
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.780]   That's like almost difficult to track.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.500]   - Yeah, I mean, I really love what they're doing.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:59.300]   I like what they, except the part where they get over 40
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.580]   and they become fucking cops on TV.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.420]   I mean, other than that, I dig what's that about.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.100]   Yeah, I don't understand that, you know,
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.020]   but that's what they do.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:13.020]   Again, this sort of glorification of cops,
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.380]   that's dangerous for a society.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.980]   And those cats who do that kind of thing,
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.100]   you know, I have a problem with that.
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.580]   - Is it all sort of to push back a little bit
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.140]   because I come from the Soviet Union
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.860]   where there's a huge amount of corruption.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.620]   And when I see what's going on with cops in this country,
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.860]   there's a lot of proper criticism you can apply,
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:36.100]   but like relative to other places,
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:40.540]   well, in so many ways, this country is incredible.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.060]   Is your criticism towards cops
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.340]   or towards what cops are asked to do?
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.580]   - Yeah, towards what cops are asked to do.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   Cops provide the shield for politician and those in power.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.420]   Absolutely, because I was in the military.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.100]   I spent four years in the military
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.220]   and I did what I was told to do.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:06.220]   And I was ignorant and thought I was doing the right thing
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.580]   and I did what I was told to do.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.540]   And so just like these guys are doing
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.020]   what they're told to do.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.500]   But no, my real beef is with the power structure,
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.980]   the folks who are telling them what to do.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.980]   And also the folks who go play cops on television.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:29.140]   That imagery, that sort of glorifying cops,
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:32.220]   that's a problem in a democracy.
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.380]   - Yeah, all sides of the glorification
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.740]   of the drug war is a problem.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.560]   - Yeah.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.860]   - If I can just linger on a little longer
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.020]   in terms of the effects of drugs
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:48.220]   on the positive mind expanding components of it,
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:53.780]   what have mind altering drugs teach you
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.220]   about the human mind?
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.900]   Sort of from a neuroscience, not even like a biochemical,
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.940]   but just like the human mind is amazing, right?
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.360]   The places it can go.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.980]   Like, are there some insights you've learned
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.180]   from studying drugs about the mind?
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.940]   - Yeah, can I start from a neurochemical perspective first
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.660]   and then we'll go larger?
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.240]   Just from a neurochemical perspective.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.420]   I mean, everything I know about the brain,
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.220]   I learned through drugs.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.700]   Because of my interest in drugs.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.180]   So I learned a lot about dopamine neurons
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.860]   in certain regions of the brain,
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:31.420]   about neuro endorphin neurons
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.300]   and a wide range of other sort of
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.060]   how our neural transmission happened because of drugs.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:41.700]   And so that's a really valuable tool lessons for me.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.060]   But then when we think that we move out a bit
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.280]   and we think more globally,
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.160]   what have I learned in terms of the mind from drugs?
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:57.620]   I have really learned how to be more forgiving of people
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:04.740]   and of myself and tolerant, more tolerant of people.
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.620]   And certainly learned a lot more about empathy
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.780]   as a result of drug use.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:18.820]   And like I said earlier,
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:23.140]   I'm learning what we can be as a species
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.920]   and it's quite incredible.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.460]   But because of drugs.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.060]   - Yeah, there's a certain property of drugs
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.900]   in different ways.
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.340]   They take you out of your body.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.500]   They help you evaluate yourself
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.580]   from a third person perspective.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.500]   It's almost like you have a consciousness in here
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.980]   and you get to step outside of it a little bit.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.940]   I mean, that's kind of what meditation does too.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.500]   All of these processes,
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.260]   that's a hell of a good workout does too.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.180]   It makes you evaluate yourself
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:54.180]   and then somehow that allows you to be forgiving to yourself
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.700]   and forgiving to others.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.660]   So empathize, it trains that part of your brain.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.180]   So stepping outside of yourself,
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.740]   not taking yourself too seriously, that process.
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.260]   And different drugs do that in different ways.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.900]   Obviously, I don't know from personal experience
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:12.900]   on some of them, but I'm now curious.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.860]   It's unfortunate that the Hollywood
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.260]   and different stories we have demonize certain drugs
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.180]   and sort of basically, I don't know,
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.500]   make it difficult for people like me to explore those ideas.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.180]   But then I'm really thankful for people like you
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.620]   who are pushing the science forward
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:33.120]   and are unafraid to talk about this kind of stuff.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.820]   'Cause I'm really fascinated with consciousness
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.140]   on the engineering side.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.220]   I really want to build robots
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.940]   that have elements of intelligence, emotion,
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.020]   even consciousness.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.620]   And for that, we need to understand it in ourselves.
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:51.080]   And drugs is, all the different kinds of drugs,
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.900]   if used safely, seems like an incredible tool
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.580]   to understand ourselves.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.080]   And if we're limiting ourselves from certain drugs
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.580]   because of certain political games that are being played,
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.180]   it's sad.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.100]   - And people know this,
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.380]   a lot of middle to upper class people know this.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.660]   The illicit drug trade business
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.900]   is a multimillion dollar industry,
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.180]   multi-billion dollar industry
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:19.220]   that could not be supported by people who are poor.
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.940]   And that has to be supported by a lot of customers.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:27.780]   And a lot of people around the world know this.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.100]   They're in the closet.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.820]   And in the book, I call for them to get out of the closet
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:35.420]   so we can start being more honest
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:38.580]   and we can take the pressure off of those people
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.860]   who are not as privileged.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.860]   Like I said, you're brave, you're bold.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.700]   I gotta ask you for some advice.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.220]   What advice would you give to a young person today?
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:52.180]   High school, maybe undergrad, college,
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.460]   thinking about their career,
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.740]   thinking about how to live a life they can be proud of.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:00.340]   - Yeah, whatever career they choose,
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.740]   just make sure that they dedicate themselves to it
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:06.540]   and be the best at what they do first.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.860]   That's what you have to do first.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:13.380]   Like people see me advocating for this position.
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.380]   30 years of science is in these opinion, this view.
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.940]   And trust me, I would be dismissed if I didn't know my shit,
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.180]   if I was not.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.340]   - Yeah, you did the work, you proved yourself.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.660]   You're legit by the people,
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.220]   in the eyes of the people who know.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.060]   - Absolutely.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:35.020]   So that's the main thing that I would encourage people to do.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.620]   Really know your craft.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.780]   If you know your craft,
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:43.780]   and then maybe you will be a service to your fellow citizens.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.380]   There are so many people out here faking the funk
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.500]   and they don't know their craft.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.060]   And they're not a service to the people
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.700]   that they claim to serve.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.940]   And that's a problem.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:00.020]   And when you have a fair number of people like that
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:04.020]   in positions of power, your society is going to crumble.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:06.940]   - What about the scientific path?
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.740]   You recommend people get a PhD?
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.940]   - Not necessarily.
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.500]   You know, like my own children, I don't recommend that.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:19.300]   So science can, certainly my science
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.460]   can be a bit very petty sort of space to be in.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:26.740]   But it was the only sort of path that I had.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.060]   And so I had to do it.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:34.060]   But no, I would really encourage people
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.180]   to just do something that they enjoy
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.540]   and something that makes them happy.
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:45.540]   Because the greater number of happy people in our society,
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.940]   the better off we all are.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:51.060]   - All right, since you mentioned happiness,
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.420]   got to ask you about the pursuit of happiness
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:57.220]   and the ridiculous question about meaning.
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.300]   Do you think this life has meaning?
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.300]   What do you think is the meaning of life?
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.060]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.620]   - I certainly hope it has meaning.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.420]   I mean, I'm certainly trying to live my life
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.460]   like it has meaning.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:12.260]   You know, I really love my life now.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.740]   I just got back from Geneva.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.860]   I spent the summer abroad in Europe
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.620]   and trying to be in a more civilized place
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:25.340]   where you can enjoy yourself as a responsible adult.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.620]   And then it allowed me to decompress
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.860]   and then come back here.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.300]   The thing about coming back here
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.260]   is that you have to be ready to fight.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.180]   And I don't want to fight anymore.
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:40.180]   You know, I just want to be able to help a society and people
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:43.060]   and so I'll have to keep a place in Europe
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.420]   to go and decompress and then come back
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.260]   to be able to tolerate the situation.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.500]   So life for me has a lot of meaning.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.540]   I'm enjoying life.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:58.540]   This is like the greatest, the best part of my life ever
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.220]   right now at this moment.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.020]   - So it's the joy,
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.020]   but you also enjoy the fight a little bit or?
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.140]   - No, I don't really, I'm tired of that.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.700]   You know, it's like, why?
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:13.540]   You're trying to, I'm trying to help people
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.020]   to see how they can be happy.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.380]   And then people are fighting me on that.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.220]   I don't want to be happy.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.180]   I want to be ignorant.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.060]   Leave me alone.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.180]   That's what people are saying.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.860]   - Well, so what is the source of joy for you
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:27.460]   when you decompress?
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.980]   - MDMA is a source.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:33.580]   You know, and a place where you don't have to worry
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.900]   about loss, that's like Europe.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:37.580]   - You can feel really free.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.460]   - Yeah.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:43.460]   Heroin can even be a nice space if I'm in my own head,
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.680]   but with others, MDMA is great.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.980]   So good friends, good food.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.700]   - The usual.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.220]   - Family, love.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.820]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.620]   - Carl, you're an incredible human being.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.320]   You really make me think everyone who listens to this,
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.340]   you're, I mean, I'm really glad you exist.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.820]   I know you say you don't like the fight,
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.420]   but I'm really glad you're fighting the fight
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.940]   'cause it's gonna help a lot of people.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.740]   It's gonna help at the very least,
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.920]   help a lot of people think
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.460]   and challenge the conventions of the day
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:22.060]   and maybe challenge them to find joy.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.740]   I really appreciate you spending your valuable time with me.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.180]   This was an awesome conversation.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.220]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.540]   - Thank you for having me, man.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.860]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Carl Hart.
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.100]   To support this podcast,
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.860]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.300]   And now let me leave you with some words from Frank Zappa.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.860]   A drug is not bad.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.220]   A drug is a chemical compound.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:47.460]   The problem comes in when people who take drugs
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.240]   treat them like a license to behave like an asshole.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.340]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:09.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
