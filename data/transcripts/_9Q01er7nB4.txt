[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:14.960]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, verses 50 and 51, the last two verses
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.040]   in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.400]   tree, believest thou?
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.840]   Thou shalt see greater things than these.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:45.520]   And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.600]   and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.160]   We come back once more to a consideration of this great and mighty and crucial statement
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.440]   which was made by the Lord Jesus Christ primarily to Nathanael, but also, together with him,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.480]   as the plural shows, to the other disciples who were also present.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.240]   We come back to it because it is one of those important statements which our Lord himself
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.320]   marks out for us as having unusual importance by introducing it with the words, Verily,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.080]   verily, Amen, Amen, Most solemnly I say unto you.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.160]   It is always good to pay unusually careful attention to any statement by our Lord that
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.760]   is introduced by Verily, verily.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.840]   And here, as we saw in our consideration of it last Sunday evening, our Lord is making
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:05.040]   one of those great pronouncements in which he rarely states the whole Gospel.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.920]   And that is why we are thus spending our time with it.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.640]   It is the complete Gospel message.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.240]   Now you remember how our Lord came to make the statement.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.600]   You remember how Philip had gone to fetch Nathanael.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.560]   Nathanael had his difficulties, you remember.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.240]   Philip does not deal with them himself.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.300]   He says, Come and see, come to him.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.840]   I tell you that this is the one of whom Moses and the prophets of old wrote.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.280]   Come and see.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   And Nathanael, being an Israelite indeed, and a man in whom was no guile, he went.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.760]   And as he was coming, our Lord looked at him and said, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.120]   is no guile.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.640]   And Nathanael was astonished and said to the Lord, How knowest thou me?
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.680]   He realized that the Lord did know him.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.600]   He was an Israelite indeed.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.520]   He was looking for the Messiah and waiting for him.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.340]   And he was without guile.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.520]   He was desperately in earnest.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.400]   He was not animated by a mere general curiosity.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.560]   This was to him the most important thing in life.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.160]   How knowest thou me?
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.480]   And our Lord replied, saying to him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.640]   fig tree, I saw thee.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.920]   And this was enough for Nathanael.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:46.280]   And Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.400]   King of Israel.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.520]   What made him say that, of course, was this, that he saw that here was one who knew all
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.160]   about him, knew his innermost thoughts, his very imaginations, this penetrating power
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   that convinced him that this was the Messiah, the Son of God.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.400]   Excellence says our Lord in effect to Nathanael, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.200]   the fig tree, believest thou?
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   It's not a question, it's an assertion.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:25.080]   This is good, you're perfectly right, you've seen it, but that isn't all, that isn't enough.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.640]   Thou shalt see greater things than these.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.640]   What are they?
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.920]   Well, our Lord proceeds to tell them.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.840]   And you remember that he puts it in this most interesting form, he goes back and borrows
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.040]   that tremendous incident in the life of the Patriarch Jacob, you remember, how when he
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.800]   was leaving home for the first time, there in his utter loneliness he put himself down
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.880]   to rest and used a stone as his pillow, and went off to sleep, and there he had his dream.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.560]   He saw the heavens opened, and this ladder between heaven and earth, and earth and heaven,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.920]   and the angels of God ascending and descending upon it, and God spoke to him, and gave him
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.520]   the great assurance that he was in his hands, and that he was going to bless him, and that
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   he had a great purpose for him.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.200]   Now God first spoke to him through the picture, through the dream, through the ladder.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.000]   The business of the ladder is to show Jacob that he is linked to heaven, and linked to
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.320]   God, and the up and down of the angels means that God is sending his blessings to his servant
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.960]   through this means.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.800]   Now then, our Lord, we saw last Sunday night, takes up this very idea, and he couples it
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:51.240]   with himself as the Son of Man, and what it amounts to we saw was this, that he is now
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   the ladder.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.320]   He doesn't mention any ladder here.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.440]   What he says is that as Jacob saw the angels ascending and descending upon that ladder,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.640]   so you are going to see the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.000]   He himself is the ladder, which we interpreted as meaning this.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.780]   He is the connecting link between heaven and earth.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.440]   He is the connecting link between God and man.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.600]   He is the medium through which God blesses mankind, and he is the only medium.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   There is no other.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.560]   It is an exclusive claim.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.200]   He is the way, the only way, and I gave you a number of scriptures in which he asserts
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   that himself.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:44.760]   Very well, that is the point at which we have arrived and from which we must now proceed.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:52.600]   Now I want to call your attention this evening to this tremendous and amazing picture of
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:01.880]   the Lord Jesus Christ as the ladder, the connecting link between heaven and earth, between God
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.760]   and man.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.640]   I want to try to show you in terms of this picture that he himself employs how this is
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:18.800]   the great theme of the New Testament gospel, that he is the one who links us to God and
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.880]   brings us to God, the ladder.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.640]   Now there are many ways in which we can approach this theme.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.480]   This is the one that commends itself to me.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:39.100]   First of all, let us give a general description of the ladder.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.640]   What are the things that you think of when you are looking at a ladder, if you are told
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.040]   about a ladder that connects one place to another?
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   Well, obviously, the first thing you want to know about is this, where is the top of
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.040]   the ladder?
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.120]   Where does the ladder reach to?
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.200]   I am the ladder, says Christ, very well, we say, where do you get to, where do you reach
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.560]   to?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   Where does this ladder, as it were, end, where does it come from, if you like?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.280]   It depends which way you are looking at it.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   Well, of course, the answer is given to us abundantly in the scripture.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.600]   I said last Sunday evening, and I repeat it again, that there is a sense in which this
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.840]   great text we are looking at this evening is a summary of the whole of the gospel according
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.480]   to St. John.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.700]   Now let me show it to you.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.320]   You say, where is the top of the ladder?
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.640]   Here is the answer.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.280]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.000]   The same was in the beginning with God.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.200]   All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that is made.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   In him was life.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   Here it is.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:56.240]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.760]   That is the top of the ladder.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.440]   But come, let us consider some other scriptures in which he says it again.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.160]   Take the third chapter of this gospel, verse 13.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.600]   And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.000]   of man which is in heaven.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.160]   That is the top of the ladder.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.240]   That is where it reaches, that is where he has come from.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.680]   But he goes on repeating this.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.360]   Let me give you just one more illustration from the 16th chapter of this gospel in verse
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   28.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.880]   "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.800]   Again I leave the world, and go to the Father."
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.360]   What a ladder!
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:57.880]   The Apostle Paul, in writing to the Philippians, puts it in this way, "Though he was in the
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:09.200]   form of God, in God, there is nothing higher than that, there is nothing beyond that.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:17.080]   God is God, from eternity to eternity, there is nothing beyond him."
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.240]   That is the topmost place that this ladder reaches to.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:31.360]   That is where it has come from, that is the highest reach, the top of the ladder.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.440]   Well now then, wait a minute.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:42.280]   The next thing we want to know about this ladder is about its various rungs.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:48.400]   A ladder consists, doesn't it, of two side pieces and these cross pieces which we call
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.720]   rungs.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.520]   And it is very important that we should know something about the rungs of this ladder.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.040]   The fundamental statement, of course, which we are considering is again the statement
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.240]   which is made in the prologue of this Gospel according to St. John.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.220]   There he is, the word, the eternal word, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.080]   substance of the eternal substance.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:19.320]   Now then, here is the ladder, "That was made fresh and dwelt among us."
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.520]   But you see, there must be rungs in the ladder.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.960]   These angels are going up and coming down.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   There must be rungs.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   Well therefore, let us look at the rungs of the ladder.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:40.720]   There again, I say, we start with that tremendous statement which the Apostle Paul makes there
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:50.860]   in that second chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians, "Who, being in the form of
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:58.840]   God," he is God, that is what that means, he is one with God, sharing the substance
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.080]   of the eternal God, co-equal, co-eternal.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.840]   Well now, there you are.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.320]   Well now, how did he come from that to this, to be made flesh and to dwell and to tabernacle
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.400]   amongst us?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.120]   There are many statements about these rungs in the Scripture, I only want to put some
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.440]   of them before you.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.680]   Have you ever looked at it like this, I wonder?
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:33.980]   The Lord himself, as it were, came down upon the ladder which is himself.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.000]   And you know what you do, don't you, when you come down a ladder?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.240]   There you are on the top of the ladder.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.040]   Well now, you take hold of the position where you were and then you put your feet down onto
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.740]   that first rung, don't you, but you're holding on to that.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.920]   But if you kept on holding on to that, you'd never come down the ladder.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.720]   Have you ever realized that our Lord did something like that?
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:03.880]   Listen to this, "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.960]   God," says this authorized version, and there, unfortunately, it's a very weak and a very
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.520]   poor translation.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.800]   It really means this, "Who, being in the form of God, thought not that a price to be
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:22.080]   clutched at or to be held on to or to hang on to."
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.640]   You see the descent beginning?
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.400]   He is that, he is there, he holds on to it, as it were, and yet he doesn't hold on to
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.520]   it.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.960]   He humbled himself.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.200]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.280]   He, as it were, let go of that place where he was and put his foot upon the rung and
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:47.440]   he began to go down and to go down.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:54.320]   He didn't regard it as a prize to be clutched at, to be hung on to, to be held on to.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:59.920]   He left behind him the signs of his eternal glory and began to come down.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.200]   He humbled himself.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.360]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.920]   That's the beginning of the descent onto the rungs of the ladder.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.360]   But come, let me take you again to that epistle to the Hebrews, the part of which we read
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.160]   at the beginning.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   What is the first rung that he had to pass, says someone?
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.240]   Oh, I can tell you that quite simply.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:36.940]   The first rung he had to pass was the position occupied by the angels.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.880]   He himself, you see, is this.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:47.160]   He is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of his person and he upholds
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.240]   all things by the word of his power.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.160]   That's who he is, that's where he was.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.680]   Well what is he in that position?
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.360]   Well, says this man, being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.400]   obtained a more excellent name than they, for unto which of the angels said he at any
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.360]   time, Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.360]   The Son of God is infinitely above the angels.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.600]   The angels are above us, but he is infinitely above the angels.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.760]   The angels are created beings.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.120]   There was a time when there wasn't an angel.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.920]   God has brought the angels into being by an act of his creative power, but he never created
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   his Son.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.680]   The Son is the only begotten, begotten, not created.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   You see the difference?
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:43.480]   Well, there he is above the angels, the Lord of the angels, entirely supreme, right away
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.800]   above them, sharing the glory with the Father, which an angel never has done and never can
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.400]   do.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:16:02.080]   Ah, therefore you see, that in coming down, he had to pass that rung, and so we read in
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:10.680]   Hebrews 2, verse 9, but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.360]   the suffering of death.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.320]   He is coming down the ladder, you see.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.120]   He is making the ladder by his descent, if you like.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.080]   Look at it whichever way you like.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.400]   But it involved this coming down, and he is past the position of angels.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.600]   Do you notice how this man, he puts it again later on, I like it very much.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.240]   He says here, "For verily, he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.520]   the seed of Abraham."
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:46.720]   He came down below them, made a little lower than the angels, he is coming down.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.800]   But of course, it did not stop there.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.560]   Let us watch him as he comes down.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.320]   Let us go through these steps that are depicted for us in this mighty epistle to the Philippians
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.760]   in the second chapter.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.000]   "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.800]   himself of no reputation."
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.600]   Then he passes the angels, Paul leaves that out, but it is there in Hebrews.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.200]   And then, "Having passed them," this is how he goes on to say, "and he took upon him the
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:31.160]   form of a servant," down he is coming, "and was made in the likeness of men," lower still.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.880]   He could have been a servant as an angel, but he is made in the likeness of men.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.880]   Down he comes, you see.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.200]   You will go to Romans 8 and you will find that he says that he is made in the likeness
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.160]   of sinful flesh.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.520]   "He took on him the seed of Abraham, in so much as the children are partakers of flesh
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.520]   and blood.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.200]   He also himself likewise took part of the same."
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.000]   Down he is coming, but he does not stop even there.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.440]   It goes on, "Being in the form of a servant, in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,"
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:19.120]   still further, "and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:25.960]   Now there we have been looking in general so far at these rungs of the ladder.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.000]   And it is, of course, the greatest mystery of eternity, the most marvelous thing that
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.840]   you and I will ever be privileged to listen to.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.440]   People are in for excitement, they tell me.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.120]   They want something thrilling.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.440]   And because they cannot get thrills, they are trying to invent something still more
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.560]   thrilling and exciting.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.080]   Do you want a thrill?
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.080]   Do you want drama?
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.000]   Do you want a spectacle to look at and to behold and to be thrilled by and to admire?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.760]   Here it is.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.720]   Look at him coming down.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.760]   Watch him as he comes from rung to rung and step to step.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.000]   And we must press on, "Where," says someone, "is the bottom of this ladder?"
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.680]   Well, we have got to be careful at this point lest we make a mistake.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.200]   He became man.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.440]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt, or tabernacled, amongst us.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.360]   But that is not the bottom of the ladder, that is very low.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.280]   Oh, to come from heaven to this earth and into this world and to live as a man, oh,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:36.600]   that was a descent, I say, that was self-abnegation, that was a humbling and a humiliation.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.240]   But that is not the bottom of it.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:49.000]   You notice how Paul went on there, "Humbled himself still further, even unto death, yea,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.760]   the death of the cross."
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.800]   Is that the end?
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.920]   Is that the lowest rung?
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.040]   Did he go no lower than the cross on Calvary's hill?
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.000]   Yes, he went even lower than that.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.480]   It's almost impossible to imagine it, but we are told that he did.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.280]   Because Paul puts to us something like this in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.960]   Ephesians, in the ninth verse, he's talking about Christ having conquered his enemies
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   and having returned to heaven and having ascended, he quotes Psalm 68.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:27.080]   But then he says this as a commentary, "Now that he ascended," what is it, "but that
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:34.120]   he also descended into the lower parts of the earth."
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   What's this mean?
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.800]   Because this is the bottom end of the ladder.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.420]   He didn't stop at being a man.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.800]   He went below that.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.720]   He did something that took him lower down even, "even unto death, yes, the death of
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.560]   the cross and all the shame and the ignominy that belongs to that, but even lower."
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.840]   He died.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.180]   He was buried.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.880]   He was placed in a grave.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:07.040]   Down in the lower parts of the earth he went to Hades, for he said to the thief that was
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.760]   dying at his side, "Today thou shalt be with me in paradise, a part of Hades."
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.400]   He's descended into the place of the dead.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.840]   And as I want to show you in a moment, he wouldn't have saved us if he hadn't gone
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.080]   there.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.040]   It was a tremendous descent to become men, but if he'd just stopped at being men and
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.880]   hadn't gone down any further, not one of us would be saved.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.440]   There'd be no such thing as a Christian.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.520]   Christ by just coming in the flesh doesn't save.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.800]   Christ by teaching doesn't save.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.760]   Christ as an example doesn't save.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:50.880]   "Before this ladder can reach me, it's got to go down, death, Hades."
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.960]   And he went.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.120]   He that ascended, what is it?
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.040]   But that he first of all descended also into the lower parts of the earth.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:20.440]   Well, now then, my friends, there it is, there I've given you a general picture of this
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.440]   ladder.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:34.640]   It's the cross of deepest woe, down among the dead, in Hades.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.040]   Peter rejoices as he preaches on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem that he's able to
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:46.400]   say, "Thou couldst not leave his soul in hell, but he was there, he went there in Hades,
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.120]   the ladder from the highest throne of glory, to Hades."
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.480]   Well, there it is, I can't stay with it this evening.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.400]   I want to press on to something else.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.800]   Think of it, my friends.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.680]   Oh, go home and spend some time in meditating upon the ladder.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.600]   Look at it, look at the rounds, see him passing by the angels, coming Lord, and down and down
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.440]   and down he goes, right onto Hades.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.200]   But come, let me ask another question which is obvious.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:24.960]   The thing that you and I want to know is this, isn't it, if he's here making the assertion
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.520]   that he is the ladder that is to connect God and men and heaven and earth, if he is the
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.680]   way of reconciling men unto God and linking men to God again, and the means whereby God
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:42.700]   is going to bless mankind once more, the questions we want to ask is this, is the ladder capable
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:50.640]   of serving the functions for which it's designed and for which he claims for it?
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.280]   Can the ladder stand the strains and the stresses?
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:01.120]   If I ask you suddenly to go from here to the top of this building and I gave you a ladder,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.040]   you'd say to me now, "Are you quite sure that that ladder is going to take my weight?
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.420]   Is it strong enough?
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.400]   Can it hold me?"
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.120]   And it's a perfectly right and a perfectly fair question to ask, having looked at your
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.000]   ladder, having seen its height, its depth, having looked at the rungs.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.640]   You say now then, "Yes, but is it strong?
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.840]   Is it stable?
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.720]   If I go up, will it suddenly start shaking and will I fall?
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.920]   Will it hold my strain, my stress?
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.000]   Will it stand up to the functions that are necessary if I'm to get up to the top of
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   the building?"
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.560]   Well now then, let's ask these questions.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.920]   Can Jesus Christ as the ladder between men and God really bring us to God?
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.000]   What do we ask of him?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   What is necessary?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.080]   Well, here are the things.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:54.000]   Can he bring us to the knowledge of God that we desire and that is salvation?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.040]   "This is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God."
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.600]   Ah, that's the great question, isn't it?
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   How can a man find out God?
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.320]   How can a man arrive at God?
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.480]   We are told that the philosophers, they sought him.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.640]   If happy, they might seek after him and find him, but they couldn't.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.120]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.480]   This is the thing that man has had in his blood and in his bones, whether he realizes
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   it always or not.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:29.360]   There is something in him that's crying out for God, for that ampler ether, diviner air.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.640]   He feels he is not made for dust, says Longfellow, and he believes that somehow he belongs.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.320]   But where is God?
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.200]   How can a man find wisdom?
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.320]   How can one attain unto this knowledge, God?
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.720]   And every man has failed.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.520]   Here is one who says, "I am the latter."
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.000]   Can he give me this knowledge?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.040]   Well, here is the answer in the 18th verse of this chapter we are looking at.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.280]   "No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:08.800]   The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him."
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.880]   He has led him forth, he has manifested him, he has taught us about him.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.520]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.560]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.760]   Do you want light on God?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.400]   He says, "I am the light of the world."
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   He is everything.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.800]   He brings us to this knowledge of God.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.120]   So he stood one afternoon when Thomas and Philip together were a little bit uncertain
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:38.440]   and doubtful, and Philip said to him, you remember, "Show us the Father and it sufficeth
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.440]   us.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.960]   We can even bear the news that you are going to leave us on condition that you show us
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.520]   the Father."
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:52.760]   And he looked at Philip and says, "Have I been so long time with you?
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.240]   And yet hast thou not known me, Philip?
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.860]   He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.520]   And how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.920]   Look at me, and you'll know the Father, you'll see him.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.780]   My Father and I are one.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:17.120]   He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.960]   Do you want to know God?
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.080]   I'm not asking do you merely want to know certain things about God, that's important.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.000]   And if you want to know things about God, you've got to come to this person.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.400]   He's the only one, all else is speculation.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.680]   God has left his fingerprints in nature and creation, but we are too blind by sin to be
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.280]   able to see him there.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.800]   We should be able to see his eternal Godhead and power, but we don't, we fail.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.280]   But not only that, I want to know him as he is.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.080]   I want to know his heart of love.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.880]   I want to be in fellowship with him.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.920]   I want to know God.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:01.360]   And there's only one way, he, the only begotten Son that is in the bosom of the Father, he
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:07.160]   hath declared him, he does it.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:17.080]   And in Christ, and in Christ alone, we can know God and have fellowship with him.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.840]   Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.480]   Wait a minute, let me come to my second demand.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.080]   I know that I am under the law.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.640]   God has given his holy law to Moses, ten commandments, moral law, there it is, it's no use arguing.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.800]   I know it's there.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.760]   I have a law written in my own heart which attests it.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.520]   I know that this is God's law, this is God's will, and God has said that unless I keep
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   that law, unless man obeys the law, he is under the wrath of God, and he's damned, and
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.920]   he's condemned, let him be as good as he likes.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.920]   The law is the demand of God.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.240]   And he is not the ladder connecting me to God unless he can deal with the law.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.320]   Can he keep God's law?
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.800]   If he cannot, he doesn't span the gulf that separates me from God.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   I needn't keep you.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.520]   He said that he had not come to destroy the law or the prophets, but to fulfill them,
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.080]   and he has done so absolutely.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.760]   He could stand and say, "Who accuseth me of sin?"
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.120]   And nobody could.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:27.400]   He said, "The prince of this world cometh and findeth nothing in me."
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.720]   Yes, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, the high priest we have is one who
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:44.840]   is holy, harmless, and undefiled, tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:51.760]   Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believe it.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.080]   He was made of a woman.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:59.280]   He was made under the law, and he kept it, he honored it, he didn't disobey God in any
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.240]   iota or tittle of this law, he has obeyed perfectly.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.300]   He has satisfied the holy law of God without any blemish whatsoever.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.480]   He is again satisfactory.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.840]   The ladder is still holding.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.360]   But come, let me ask another question.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.320]   I and all other men have not only the problem of keeping the law, there is the problem of
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:33.600]   the devil and the fight with devil and the Satan and sin and temptation.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.720]   I see this ladder between earth and heaven.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.560]   Yes, but I see something happening.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.760]   There is one who doesn't want men to be right with God.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:49.880]   He is our adversary, the devil, and his ambition is to keep us eternally separated from God
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.800]   in order that he may ruin God's work.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:59.280]   And now he sees that here is a ladder claiming to go from man to God and God to man.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   And what happens?
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.120]   Well, he does what is inevitable.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:09.040]   The devil came and he began shaking the ladder.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.960]   Forty days and forty nights he tempted our Lord in the wilderness, and this is how he
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:20.400]   tempted him, "If, if, thou be the Son of God."
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.760]   If you are the ladder that you claim to be, if thou art the Son of God, he is trying to
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:32.600]   shake him, to shake the ladder, not only that by his subtle temptations.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.640]   He is trying to get our Lord to do things that his father hadn't sent him to do.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.720]   He said, "If you be the Son of God, why don't you commend these stones and turn them
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.360]   into bread?
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.200]   Why don't you fall from the pinnacle of the temple and give such a marvelous, miraculous
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.280]   display of yourself that everybody will be convinced?
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.000]   I'll give you all the kingdoms of this world at once.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I'll give you them in a second if you only bow down and worship me."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.540]   He was trying to shake the ladder.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:10.840]   He was trying to cause it to crash to the ground and to smash it in utter failure.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.040]   Ah, yes, he was tempted in all points like as we are.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.920]   The devil brought out all his might and all his reserves.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:27.800]   He tried to shake the Son of God in a way that you and I will never be shaken.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:37.320]   Tempted in all points like as we are, yet, without sin, he didn't shake.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   He didn't move.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.240]   He remained where he was.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.440]   "Get thee behind me," he repulsed him by quoting Scripture.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.560]   The ladder is still standing and still holding, but wait a minute.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:58.840]   "I know that the wrath of God has been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.760]   of men, and it's against me."
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:07.720]   "We are all by nature," says Paul, "the children of wrath, even as others."
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:13.160]   The wrath of God is upon every infant born into this world, whether you like it or not,
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   it's a fact.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:21.280]   We are the children of wrath by nature.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.120]   Can he do anything about this?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:32.040]   If I am to be saved, somehow or another, the wrath of God is to be taken off me, and he
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.960]   says that he's come to save me, to reconcile me to God, very well, he's got to take the
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.200]   wrath of God in my stead.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.240]   And he has done so.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:55.080]   God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:02.960]   of God in him, who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:11.880]   dead to sin, should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we are healed.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.280]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:22.680]   I see him smitten of God, the wrath of God descends upon him there on Calvary.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.080]   Can you see it?
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:34.280]   The avalanche of God's wrath upon the ladder, can it stand?
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.400]   And if it hadn't stood, I wouldn't be in this pulpit, there'd be no gospel to preach.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.960]   He can bear it.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:48.000]   He bore it all, and still stands.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.840]   Death and the grave, can he do anything about these?
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.480]   For there I see him dying upon that cross.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   I see him expiring and dismissing his spirit into the hands of God.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:08.000]   I see them taking down his dead body and putting it into a grave, and rolling a stone upon
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   it.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Can he deal with death?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.360]   Can he deal with the grave?
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.440]   If he cannot, I'm still undone.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.680]   He's borne the wrath and the punishment, but is he dead?
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.600]   Does he remain there?
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.400]   You know the answer if you don't listen to it.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:30.760]   Before he came to all that, he looked at his father in prayer, and he said, "I have finished
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.280]   the work which thou gavest me to do."
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:43.080]   And his last utterance of the cross was, "It is finished, finished, what the redemption
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.120]   of men, the ladder, the purpose of the ladder, finished.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:51.320]   Yes, but he dies, he's gone down, oh, that isn't the end.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:57.640]   Go on, rush on to the morning of the third day, the resurrection proves that he's conquered
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.400]   death and the grave also.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.720]   He couldn't be held by death, he's burst thus under the bends of death, he's arisen triumphant
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   o'er the grave.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:11.640]   See him rising, he's gone down, he's ascending, he's beginning to go up again.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.920]   Watch him as he comes and manifests himself for forty days, look at him in the ascension
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:23.320]   as he rises in the presence of the disciples on Mount Olivet, and back he's gone where?
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:35.200]   Well, as the Hebrew author tells us, "Having once and forever purged our sins, sat down
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:42.800]   on the right hand of the majesty on high, there he is, he is passed through the heavens
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.600]   again, the heavens that he came down through as he came down, he is passed through the
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.080]   great high priest Jesus, the son of God, who has passed through the heavens, up he goes
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.280]   rung after rung, and he's back at the point from which he came.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:03.800]   He'd prayed, hadn't he, in the seventeenth of John again, "Father, glorify me with the
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:09.040]   glory that I had with thee before the foundation of the world," and he's done it, he's back
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.040]   again.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:17.440]   The ladder's started there, it's come down, he goes back from the highest throne of glory,
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:27.880]   come down unto Hades, and there he is, he's ascended again, above the heavens.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:35.560]   "Well, dear me," says somebody, "this is very wonderful, but it seems a long way from
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.400]   me.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.800]   I am still in this world of sin and shame and evil, and you're talking about this wonderful
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.240]   person and saying these glorious things, is he still interested in me?
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.520]   Did he draw the ladder up after me when he went back and shut the trapdoor?
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.260]   Has he gone to heaven and is he leaving me on earth?
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.680]   Is the ladder still here?"
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.520]   Listen to this, do you know what he's doing up there?
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:08.360]   He ever liveth to make intercession for us, he's still connected, the ladder is still
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:13.080]   there, from him to me.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:19.320]   He is still touched with a feeling of our infirmities.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.920]   What's he doing there?
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:30.840]   Well, he is our advocate with the Father.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:39.300]   In every pang that rends the heart, the man of sorrows bears apart.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:49.880]   He sympathizes with our grief, and to the sufferer sends relief.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:58.000]   Go and read your book of Revelation, and you'll find that he's still as a lamb that had been
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.160]   slain, he's still the same person.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.880]   He's taken your human nature and mine there with him, he's still linked to us, in touch
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.880]   with us.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.840]   We are in him, he is in us, we are joined to him, we are members of his body, of his
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.400]   flesh, and of his bones.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.200]   Thank God when he went back he didn't lift the ladder up, he's left it.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   He's still the ladder himself, and he's linked to me.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:35.320]   Say well, my friends, can you think of any further tests to put to this ladder?
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:40.880]   Can you think of any other stresses or strains that can ever shake it or throw it down or
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.880]   smash it?
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.560]   I defy you to do so.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.960]   He's been tested to the very limit, to the very uttermost.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.000]   Everything that God could do, as it were, when he poured his wrath upon him has been
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.580]   done, and hell brought out all its reserves, there was nothing it didn't do.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:04.240]   But he stands, he stood.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.840]   The ladder has passed every test.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:14.040]   Well, as a result of that, what are the blessings that come to me?
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.320]   That's what he's saying, isn't it, that as the ladder, he is the one on whom the angels
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:25.200]   of God will be ascending and descending in order that we might have God's blessings
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.440]   and munificence and all his glorious gifts.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   What are they?
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:37.120]   Well, I'm merely going to give you a list, but listen.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:45.520]   By him and through him alone, because of all that I've been describing, I have forgiveness
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:53.760]   of sins, I am reconciled to God.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:01.680]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.080]   Because he's borne my sins and their punishment, because his blood was shed as the sacrifice
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:14.160]   and the offering, because he stood in my place and the wrath of God that I deserved came
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:22.880]   on him, my sins are forgiven, they've been washed away forever.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:30.960]   I am justified in the presence of God by the work and the righteousness of the Lord Jesus
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   Christ.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   Not only that, we are sons of God.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:48.160]   Listen to it here again in this first chapter, "But as many as received him, to them gave
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:56.520]   he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name."
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:02.720]   He alone can make you a son of God, nobody else can, he can and he does.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:08.000]   By thus linking you to God, you become a partaker of the divine nature in him.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.800]   You are in him, you are therefore a child of God.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   And therefore, of course, in him and through him you come to know God as your Father.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.480]   Oh, what a blessed thing that is!
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:32.100]   In a world like this, you don't pray in need and trouble to whatever gods may be, you go
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:39.880]   not merely to God the Creator, God the Great Eternal Ruler, you can go to him and say,
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.600]   "My God, my Father."
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:50.800]   The New Covenant says, "I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people."
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:43:00.320]   And Christ has ratified the New Covenant by his blood and God is my Father.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.340]   And so I can go to him with confidence and with assurance.
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:10.440]   I need mercy, for I still sin, but I can go with boldness to the throne of grace and obtain
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:17.720]   mercy and find grace to help in times of need.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:24.800]   And so I am always sure that I am blessed of God.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:32.720]   Always blessed by God, for he has said, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   Never.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.960]   Doesn't matter what happens, doesn't matter what men may do to you, doesn't matter what
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:45.500]   the world does to you, doesn't matter what life or death does to you, I will never leave
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.200]   thee nor forsake thee.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:54.320]   I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.560]   nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:08.880]   shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in the ladder, Christ Jesus.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   Nothing can separate.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:18.440]   The ladder is fixed from him to me, from me to him.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:26.800]   And then the amazing blessings of sanctification, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.320]   We know the fight against sin, don't we?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:36.280]   We know what it is to cry out in anguish, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.620]   me from the body of this death?
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.160]   The evil that I would not that I do, and the good that I would I do not.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.160]   What can I do?
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   O desperate!
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:50.240]   Can I be lifted up and delivered?"
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:56.880]   I thank God through Jesus Christ my Lord.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:03.360]   What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, the rung of that ladder
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.360]   broke.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   He couldn't take the weight of sin.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:12.240]   What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.880]   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:23.880]   righteousness of God might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   the Spirit.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.960]   He serves me here again.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.800]   What a blessing!
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.560]   What else?
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:40.400]   Well, death is coming, and how can I go through that?
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.840]   Is there anything beyond it?
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.840]   Is there any hope?
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.640]   Yes, there is a glorious hope in Christ.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.880]   Listen to the author of the epistle to the Hebrews putting it.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:59.120]   He is talking about a great world of glory that is to come, in which men are going to
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.680]   dwell, this world to come of which we speak.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.120]   How can I get into that?
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.120]   Is there any hope for me?
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.720]   Well, here is the answer.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.640]   I look at the world as I see it round and about me, and I don't get the impression
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.840]   that man is the Lord of creation.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.040]   I see not yet all things made subject unto him.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.360]   Well, where is the hope?
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.840]   Here it is.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:32.640]   We see Jesus already triumphed over it all, has already risen over it all, and there he
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.680]   is waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.160]   Therefore, I have this hope; it is a hope which is both sure and steadfast and which
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:49.720]   entereth even into the veil as an anchor for my soul.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.400]   Different terms, but the same picture.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.840]   He says it is like an anchor that steadies my little frail bark.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.520]   The anchor has gone through.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.680]   I say the ladder has gone through.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:08.120]   I don't see that, but Jesus is there, and I am linked to him.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.120]   What else?
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:18.320]   Well, while we are still in this world, we have this great promise that the angels of
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.440]   God will minister to us.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:25.960]   Christ said we should see them coming up and down, and here again it is in Hebrews 1.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.600]   He is talking about the angels.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:33.880]   "Are they not all," he says, "ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them,
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:40.480]   who shall be the heirs of salvation?"
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:46.260]   Our Lord says about the little children that in heaven there are angels to behold the face
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.560]   of my Father that is in heaven.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.440]   Christian people, it is about time we went back and considered the biblical teaching
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.880]   about angels.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:58.800]   The angels of God are ministering spirits to serve you and me, and I believe they are
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.960]   watching over us, and they are ministering to us when we don't know it, but they are
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.640]   there holding us back, restraining, keeping evil away.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.880]   What a wonderful thing.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:17.800]   The angels of God are coming down and going up along Christ to help me, an heir of salvation.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:26.160]   "Yes," you say, "that's very wonderful, but I've still got to die."
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   You tell me that there is that glory beyond it, but how can I pass through death itself?
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.600]   Well, here is my answer.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:42.520]   Our Lord told us about a certain beggar who lived at the gate of a rich man, and the dogs
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.280]   used to lick his poor wounds.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:51.400]   He says the beggar, it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.280]   into Abraham's bosom.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:04.200]   And I have biblical authority therefore to tell you at this moment that if you are a
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:15.800]   child of God, you needn't fear death; the angels of God will carry you through and take
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.160]   you to be with him.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.520]   You know, many saints have seen them; they have said that their bedrooms have been full
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   of them.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.240]   They have seen them, but whether we see them or not, they are there.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:35.200]   The angels of God, who have been ministering to us through life, will carry us through
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:41.520]   the river, bear us in their arms, and present us to him.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:48.080]   "Well, that's death-catered for," says somebody, "but my body is buried in the
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   grave.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.080]   What of that?"
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.440]   Well, our Lord has answered, the latter has spoken, "I will raise him up in the last
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.440]   day."
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.800]   He is being raised; we shall be raised.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:04.000]   "The spirit that is in you," says Paul to the Romans, "shall also raise and quicken
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.200]   your mortal bodies."
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:13.000]   We therefore wait for the adoption to wit, the redemption of our bodies.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.560]   Yes, this is my confidence; this is my hope.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:26.880]   I look to heaven, of which I am a citizen, for the coming of the Son of God, who, when
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:36.880]   he comes, shall change this, my vile body, and fashion it according to the body of his
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:45.800]   glorification, according to that mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things, even
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.800]   unto himself.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   There it is.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   He is the latter.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.560]   He has come from heaven to earth; he has gone down to Hades; he has gone back to heaven.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.520]   Can he do—can he take me there?
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.880]   Does he really save me?
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.880]   Can he link me to God?
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:02.360]   I have asked every question you can ever think of; he has answered yes to every one.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:11.280]   I know that as I stand at this moment in this pulpit, he will deliver me completely, body,
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:19.920]   soul, and spirit, and will present me faultless, without spot or blemish, or any such thing,
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.520]   gloriously, in the presence of God.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:42.120]   He will raise me up, and I shall spend my eternity with him.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:48.720]   Nathanael, because I said unto thee that I saw thee whilst thou wast under the fig tree,
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:56.200]   believest thou that thou shalt see greater things than these?
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:01.060]   There they are.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:13.640]   He is not only son of God, he is son of men—the ladder, the link, the reconciler, the mediator.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.600]   Have you seen him so?
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.240]   Is he the ladder to you?
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.240]   Are you in him?
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.240]   Are you on him?
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.280]   Is he in you?
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.720]   God forbid that I should merely stand and paint a picture.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.600]   This is life.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.520]   You are in this world; God is in heaven.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:41.760]   You have got to die; you have got to meet God.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:51.920]   And there is only one way to die and to face God without fear, and it is to be in Christ.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:53:01.280]   Link to God through Jesus Christ, who, in order to save you and to redeem you, came
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:13.840]   down via the angels, man, death of the cross, shame, burial, Hades, in order to deliver
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:25.200]   you, to reconcile you to God and to make you his child, and to open to you the gate of
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.800]   heaven and everlasting bliss.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   Do you see the ladder?
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.520]   Are you holding on to him?
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:40.520]   If you haven't done so until this moment, fly to him, hold on to him, and he then will
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:43.680]   never let you go.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.320]   Amen.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
