[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - You mentioned that boundaries are something that we do
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.300]   and that the requires that the other do nothing.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.580]   Can we go a little bit further into that
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.140]   because it's a beautiful concept
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.820]   and this notion of boundaries,
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.840]   but like a gaslighting narcissism
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.500]   and all the other things that we hear about nowadays,
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.140]   I think is often badly misunderstood.
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620]   So tell us more about boundaries
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.400]   and how that looks in the action sense of it.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.180]   - And this is also connected to what you're saying,
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.640]   that other, other relationship.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.060]   I'm a person, you're a person.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.720]   And so many times that's actually is what gets merged.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.860]   And so my kid gets upset that I say
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.880]   they can't watch another show.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.920]   And a parent really in that moment,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.180]   it's like, whose feelings are whose?
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.020]   Like they were upset, was I was upset?
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.140]   A second ago, I thought I should set the boundary.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.740]   And now all of a sudden I'm changing my mind.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.620]   There is this complete role kind of confusion and merger,
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.380]   which is one of the main reasons
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.800]   that kids get actually really scared
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.920]   and escalate their behavior
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.940]   'cause they don't have a sturdy leader
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.140]   when they really need one, right?
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140]   So boundaries are what we tell someone we will do
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.100]   and they require the other person to do nothing.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.740]   I like this definition for a lot of reasons.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.740]   I'm just very practical.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.980]   So it allows me after I set a boundary to like assess,
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.020]   was that a boundary or not, right?
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.300]   Because let's take the TV example.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.500]   It's whatever time at night,
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.120]   my kid has just watched a show
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.740]   and they know they're supposed to watch one show
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.840]   and then, you know, turn off the TV.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500]   I hear from parents a lot, my kid doesn't listen
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.420]   or my kid doesn't respect my boundaries.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.180]   And I'll say, okay, like that sounds hard.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.020]   Let's get into that.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.580]   So then I'll say, so I told my kid to shut off the TV.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.780]   They just kept watching.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.620]   They just kept on.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.900]   I told my kid to stop jumping on the couch
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.340]   and they kept jumping.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.300]   They don't respect my boundaries.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.940]   They don't listen.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.940]   To me, this is like a beautiful example of like,
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.500]   this is a problem, I agree,
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.540]   but this is not a boundary problem.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.140]   You made a request of your child.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.800]   And frankly, if you have your,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.600]   I'm making this up, seven-year-old watching TV,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.440]   I'm not so good at putting away TV and a phone at night.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.800]   Like, it's just hard for me to do.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   So your seven-year-old probably is just, you know,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.440]   addicted to what's ever happening.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.160]   And we're kind of asking our kid to do our job for us
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.680]   because we don't want our kid to be mad at us
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.840]   or whatever it is.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.880]   A boundary in that situation would be saying,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.320]   ooh, you didn't put off the TV.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200]   Look, by the time I get over there,
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.920]   if you haven't turned off the TV,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.600]   and I don't want to do this, but I will,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.900]   I will take the remote out of your hand and shut it off.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.300]   A boundary saying, ooh, after my request doesn't work,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.220]   can you get off the couch?
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.440]   You can jump on the floor.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.780]   Look, if by the time I get over there,
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.480]   you haven't gotten off the couch, I will pick you up.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.780]   That is like, I would say,
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.300]   I'm not gonna put the success of my intervention
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.780]   in my like seven-year-old's hand.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.940]   I care too much about my own needs
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.100]   and my own role as a leader in my home to do that, right?
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.140]   Same thing with, let's say in-laws.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.800]   My mother-in-law doesn't respect my boundary.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.520]   She always shows up without calling.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.680]   Now, I don't wanna get to this point,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.160]   and there's a lot of things in a relationship
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.040]   we can do before we get to this point,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.720]   but if that's really a boundary,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.680]   and I have a very kind of intrusive mother-in-law,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.960]   a boundary would be saying, look,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.280]   this is gonna be awkward, and I know you mean well,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.640]   but the next time you come unannounced,
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.560]   I will come to your car and say,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.680]   oh, this time doesn't work for us.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.040]   You cannot come in,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.240]   and I will go back into my house and close the door.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.540]   Like, now, there's gonna be lots of feelings around that,
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.980]   but you are now setting a true boundary,
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.520]   and when we say our kids don't listen,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.780]   those are often situations, not all of them,
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.580]   but there's a big percentage
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.580]   where I'm actually not setting a boundary early enough
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.700]   and in a sturdy enough way,
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.140]   which is what my kid needs because at that point,
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.580]   they simply don't have the skills to inhibit an urge,
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.180]   and they need me to be the boundary for them.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.560]   - We hear sometimes that kids are craving rules.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.140]   They're craving boundaries.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.260]   I don't know, I was kind of a wild adolescent and teenager,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.060]   maybe a little more than wild.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.620]   I don't recall ever craving rules,
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.200]   but I do recall paying attention to their lack of presence.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.300]   So what of that?
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.180]   Is this notion that kids really want
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.500]   and crave rules and boundaries,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.340]   is that sort of a, I don't know,
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.560]   projection that we put onto them?
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.820]   And I'm not exploring this just for fun.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.340]   I'm exploring it because I think that one thing
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.380]   that's very helpful in setting boundaries,
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.560]   especially with kids, is the idea that, gosh,
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.100]   even if it's a bit painful to see them in discomfort,
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.260]   there's that empathy piece that you talked about before,
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.700]   that empathic attunement
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.260]   can get in the way of boundaries, right?
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.200]   These are, and they're not mutually exclusive,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.220]   but these are somewhat competing forces at times.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.340]   So if we know, or if we can acknowledge,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.640]   or at least explore this idea
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.660]   that rules are deep down what they really want,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.900]   not just what they need, maybe it would help.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.900]   - Yes, and I think, by the way, in my taking the remote away
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.460]   or taking my kid off the couch, just to be clear,
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.940]   if I do that to my kid, they are not going to say,
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.220]   "Oh, mom, you are the best mom in the world, thank you."
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.860]   They are going to cry and scream.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.860]   And that's where boundaries and empathy,
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.380]   those two parts of our job, actually do always go together.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.580]   I think they're actually partners.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.780]   They're not actually at odds
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.260]   because as soon as my kid is upset,
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.280]   what I would say to them is,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.300]   "Oh, you wanted to jump on the couch.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.560]   "It's not as much fun on the floor.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.720]   "Oh, you really wanted to watch another show.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.200]   "You didn't even want it this big.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.420]   "You wanted to watch it this big."
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.380]   It sounds crazy 'cause you're like,
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.140]   "Wait, why am I empathizing with that feeling?"
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.420]   They just kind of disobey.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.460]   No, they're two different things.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.460]   I'm doing my job and setting a boundary.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.740]   They're actually doing their job and feeling their feelings.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.880]   That's actually their job.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.780]   The only way you can ever learn to regulate a feeling
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.540]   is through feeling the feeling.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.240]   So they're doing their job.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.380]   Now I'm gonna validate.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.420]   And this is how kids learn emotion regulation.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.700]   Boundaries, they feel.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.100]   I validate, I hold the boundary over and over and over.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.060]   So do kids crave rules?
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.980]   And I think one of the issues
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.660]   is that most parenting approaches have one or the other.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.420]   And I think they're both very incomplete strategies.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.060]   If you just lead with rules, right?
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.900]   I don't know who said it.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.740]   Probably wasn't me.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.560]   Like, what is it?
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.460]   Rules without relationship lead to rebellion.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.940]   Yeah, that's what happens, right?
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.500]   So that's not good.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.300]   But I see the stainage.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.820]   We've swung the other direction.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.220]   It is also not a complete parenting strategy
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.380]   when your kid's jumping on the couch to do nothing
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.240]   if you think that's dangerous and to say,
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.580]   "Oh, you really wanna jump, jump, jump
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.820]   and such big feelings."
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.420]   Like that's not what kids need.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.780]   I think kids crave boundaries
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.440]   and they crave feeling seen and understood.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.840]   Because as kids are growing up,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.760]   like I think the questions they're always asking parents,
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.460]   even though of course they never say this,
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.340]   it's just, "Am I real and am I safe?"
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.520]   Every interaction, that's what they're asking us.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.020]   The reason we have to validate their feelings
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.860]   when they're upset, even though they're so upset
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.720]   just that their string cheese broke, whatever it is,
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.120]   is feelings don't have markers like blood
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.480]   or like they don't know.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.300]   And so when we say,
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.880]   "Oh, you wanted your string cheese to be together."
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.360]   What we're really saying
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   is the things you experience inside of you are real.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.560]   But kids are also desperate to know like,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.080]   "How far do things go?"
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.980]   No one likes to feel boundary-less as a kid.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.920]   That's terrifying, right?
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.280]   And so when we set a boundary,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.400]   we actually say to a kid,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.840]   like, "I will always protect you."
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.280]   Like, "I won't let things get so far out of control."
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.520]   So I do think, I don't know if it's rules,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.240]   but kids crave connection.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.160]   And I think boundaries and kind of validation and empathy,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.280]   they are the two forms of connection
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.760]   that kids, yeah, are really desperate for.
