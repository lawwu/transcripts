[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   So I wanted to do a quick deep dive today
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.400]   before we got into our questions.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.720]   We do have a good collection of questions,
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.580]   but I wanted to tackle this question,
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.120]   is friction bad?
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.360]   And the precipitating event
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.360]   that got me thinking about this question
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.360]   was reading John McPhee's book, "Draft Number Four."
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.440]   So "Draft Number Four" is a book
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.880]   that John McPhee wrote relatively recently
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.260]   about the process of writing
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.520]   and things he has learned about the process of writing.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.020]   There's a little bit of memoir thrown in there
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.120]   and quite a bit of discussion on things like structure.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.460]   And what caught my attention,
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.880]   among other things when I was reading it,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.080]   is that he described his research process,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.600]   how he organized and made use of the information
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.040]   he collected during research in the pre-computer era.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.040]   So McPhee has been active in professional writing
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.880]   since the '60s,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.920]   a long period before there were computers.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.640]   And here was his process.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.520]   He would go out in the field
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.080]   and take tons of notes,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.600]   both in notebooks and on tape recorders.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.960]   And McPhee is a long-term researcher.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960]   It's not unusual for him to spend eight months,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.800]   12 months on a single article.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.640]   Now, of course, back then,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.060]   they would write articles of crazy lengths,
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.340]   like 40,000-word articles, which is crazy.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.040]   They'd have to break them up over multiple issues.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.140]   There are many books.
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.560]   But he would fill up many notebooks, many tape recorders.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.840]   All right, so how do we get from that?
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.180]   How does McPhee get from that?
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.680]   Stack of notebooks, stack of tapes,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.360]   to an article that's coming out in "The New Yorker."
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.960]   So here's what he used to do.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   First, he would painstakingly type up all of those notes.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.600]   So he would go through the notebooks
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.720]   and type up on his typewriter,
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.400]   remember, pre-computer era,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.280]   type up on his typewriter
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.740]   everything that was in those notebooks.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.820]   Then he would go to those tapes
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.060]   and he would transcribe everything
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.660]   that was recorded on those tapes,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.100]   all of the interviews and conversations on those tapes.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.460]   He had one of those old-school dictation desks
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.340]   where you had foot pedals,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.560]   so you could control the speed of the tape recorder
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.380]   with a foot pedal so that you could slow it down
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.620]   just enough that you could keep up when you're typing.
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.300]   This used to be real common back when dictation was used.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.300]   So he would type everything up.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.060]   And when he was typing it up on his typewriter,
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.840]   separate blocks of notes would be separated
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.140]   with multiple blank lines.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.780]   So, okay, here's some notes from one conversation.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.380]   Now here's some notes about something else.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.520]   He'd put blank lines.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.700]   And the reason why he would do that
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.940]   is that after he had laboriously typed up all of this,
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.620]   and we're talking weeks and weeks of work,
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.140]   he would Xerox copy every one of those pages,
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.540]   take the Xerox copies and cut out each of those blocks.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.100]   So he had space in between each block of notes
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.440]   and he would cut out strips from these pages
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.180]   along those spaces between the blocks of notes.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.260]   So he would just have endless slips of paper,
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.100]   each piece of paper with a separate piece of conversation
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.100]   or observation or note that he had took.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.720]   Then he would sort those strips of papers into topic
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.340]   and put them all into a folder dedicated to that topic.
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.340]   So now he would have, after weeks of work,
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.820]   dozens of folders,
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.620]   each dedicated to a particular event,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.980]   discussion, or topic relevant to the article.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.340]   And the folder would be full of all of his notes
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.740]   he had taken anywhere relevant to that topic.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.660]   Finally, he would then take a card,
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.660]   I'm assuming it'd be an index card, he didn't specify.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.620]   And for each of these topics,
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.780]   he would write that name on a card.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.780]   And he had a piece of plywood in his office.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.400]   And Justin and I were talking about this earlier,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.880]   but I was gratified to hear that early in his career,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.180]   McPhee had a deep work HQ style office.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.100]   It was a Nassau street above a store,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.860]   across the hall from a massage parlor,
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.420]   just like we're above a restaurant
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.700]   on the main street of our town,
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.380]   across from a physical therapist.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.740]   And I don't even know what the other people do.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.220]   I think they mainly just glared us for not wearing masks,
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.020]   but I don't even know what they do.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.580]   But in our weird HQ, so McPhee had a weird HQ as well.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.460]   And he would lay these cards out on the plywood
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.540]   and move them around, move them around.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.900]   What's the structure for this piece?
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.580]   And he could spend weeks doing that
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.540]   until he finally had figured out this topic
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.940]   and this topic and back to this.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.380]   And he had all the cards figured out.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.940]   Now he was ready to write.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.020]   And when it came time to write,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.020]   he would say, this is the card I'm on right now.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.300]   Let me take the folder corresponding to that card,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.340]   open it up, spread out all these slips of paper.
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.180]   Here's everything I know about that topic.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.580]   So I can draw from these quotes and these citations
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.580]   and these observations as I'm writing
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.540]   that section of the article.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.580]   Then he moved on to the next section,
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.020]   take that folder, lay them out,
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.300]   write that section of the article.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.860]   That is how John McPhee would research
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.020]   and write his articles.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.220]   This is an incredibly laborious process.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.900]   It's a very time-consuming process.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.340]   He would spend weeks and weeks
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.940]   just working with his notes before he was writing.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.940]   It is a process that is full of friction.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.220]   He's literally cutting paper with scissors
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.620]   and putting them in folders.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.700]   I mean, this is a process
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.940]   where there's friction all over the place.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.260]   But anyone reading that part of draft number four
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.300]   would say that makes complete sense.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.180]   What John McPhee was trying to do necessitates slowness.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.580]   He has to internalize this information,
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.860]   be exposed to it again and again,
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.700]   marinate in this information
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.620]   until he really just feels like he is in that world
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.460]   and understands it.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.260]   So as he begins trying to structure his piece,
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.500]   he can see how it should all come together.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.000]   And when it comes time to write a section,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.620]   he can see what's out there and knows what to pull from.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.180]   The friction is a feature,
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.180]   not a bug in this particular system.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.100]   And this is common if you study the writing techniques
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.260]   and the research techniques
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.360]   of really acclaimed nonfiction writers.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.260]   They have high friction, slow systems.
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.060]   Now, there's an early essay I wrote
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.260]   for my newsletter and blog at calnewport.com years ago,
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.640]   where I talked about
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.420]   the historian Taylor Branch's research methods.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.060]   So Taylor Branch wrote this fantastic
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.660]   award-winning trilogy,
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.420]   three-part biography of Martin Luther King,
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.620]   epic, epic project, many, many years.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.980]   I believe it won a Pulitzer
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.620]   or a National Book Award, one of the two, fantastic series.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.180]   And he talked about years ago,
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.220]   and I wrote about this, a similarly slow process.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.180]   Now, he had computers at the time he was writing this,
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.820]   but he used a Microsoft Access database
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.420]   and everything, every bit of note he would find anywhere,
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.760]   he would just read everything, everything.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.740]   What are all the news?
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.020]   Here's a day when Martin Luther King is in this town.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.780]   Let me go find all the newspapers from that town
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.700]   on microfiche and go read them
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.620]   and pull out anything that seems relevant
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.840]   to understanding what was going on that day.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.980]   So, I mean, he would really read every letter,
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.180]   but would go three, four layers away
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.940]   from even what King was doing
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.140]   just to find all this tangential information.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.420]   And he coded everything with a date
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.420]   and put it into this database.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.860]   And then he could spit out, like, okay,
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.100]   here's the period of King's life that I'm writing about now.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.140]   And he could spit out,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.060]   give me everything I have notes on from like this week.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.660]   Every letter that was written that week,
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.020]   every newspaper I looked at.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.100]   And so, again, this laborious process
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.300]   of let me just take everything in
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.940]   and put into a database and time code it.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.000]   So when it comes time to write,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.580]   I can have a density of information.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.060]   What happened on this day and this week
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.700]   and immerse myself in it and then write.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.300]   With confidence and with that iceberg
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.780]   below the surface of knowledge,
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.420]   supporting the thing that he was actually writing about.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.140]   A slow process, laborious process,
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.540]   but a necessary process.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.500]   So we see this with acclaimed writers,
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.140]   high friction, slow systems
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.360]   for making sense of information.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.860]   Where we don't see this as anywhere else.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.220]   And that is what I was noting is that that is a problem.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.180]   We have made productivity synonymous
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.020]   with low friction and speed.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.740]   How do we get this done faster?
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.260]   How do we get you the information you need quicker?
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.200]   Can we make connections for you on your behalf?
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.180]   Maybe the software can show you what you need.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.580]   Can we throw machine learning at it?
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.000]   This would be the new thing to do.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.680]   So that the amount of extra effort you have to do
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.220]   really does get minimized.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.340]   And when it comes to hard cognitive work,
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.640]   especially creative cognitive work,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.540]   minimizing friction, minimizing effort
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.780]   is not necessarily what we wanna do.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.100]   The example of John McPheen,
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.580]   the example of Taylor Branch
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.760]   is canonical slow productivity in action.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.940]   What they were doing required in the moment,
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.420]   inefficient, slow, thoughtful work.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.940]   You look at any one day and you might say,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.980]   this day was not productive.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.700]   You cut things with scissors all day,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.140]   but you fast forward out,
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.780]   zoom out to the looking at the next year, that full year,
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.680]   you say, wow, this was a fantastic article
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.520]   you produced that year.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.620]   It's a very productive year.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.700]   You zoom into a particular day,
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.940]   you see you're just cutting things with scissors,
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.900]   zoom out, incredibly productive year.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.440]   And this was my observation.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.500]   Friction is sometimes something we wanna get rid of.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.860]   If I'm doing a mindless administrative task,
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.180]   make it easier for me to do it, sure.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.300]   But sometimes friction is exactly what we need.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.300]   If you're doing something deep,
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.380]   taking your time, going slow, having old tools,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.700]   having to do processes to take time
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.940]   can be a feature and not a bug.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.340]   So I think it's something we just need to keep in mind.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.940]   Sometimes going slower,
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.780]   sometimes having things be a little bit harder
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.780]   is what you need.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.500]   That's what it sometimes takes to do hard work.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.220]   So I admire that process.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.640]   By the way, like McPhee goes on
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.360]   and talked about his computer setup,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.740]   once he got a computer setup,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.820]   and he ran this completely weird
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.220]   old school editing software called K-Edit.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.460]   That's like a line editor.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.680]   It's not a WSYW word processor
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.740]   that someone custom programmed for him.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.420]   And he tried to explain it and I couldn't understand it.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.500]   So when he got computers, it did not simplify his life.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.780]   He did not have a sort of Rome account,
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.700]   Zettelkasten system that was automatically
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.040]   putting all of his notes around.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.580]   Somehow his computerized system
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.300]   seemed even more complicated to me
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.380]   than what he was doing with the note cards.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.540]   - Your buddy Ryan has a similar process too, right?
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.500]   With the note cards and folders and stuff.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.460]   - Yeah, Ryan will write down,
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.580]   Holiday will write down everything of interest
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.660]   from the books he's reading
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.180]   and then put them away into boxes of note cards.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.900]   And he takes his time.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.100]   And then when it comes time to write a book,
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.700]   he'll go through and pull out the note cards
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.980]   he thinks are relevant to that book
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.020]   and the information is all there.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.020]   Yeah, it takes a lot longer to do the reading,
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.740]   but he would say that's the point.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.980]   It's like, yeah, I want it to take long.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.580]   I want to pull out the ideas.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.500]   I want to think about them.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.700]   I want to store them so I can use them later.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.180]   You know, slowness is underrated,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.420]   especially in our current world of work.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.280]   (upbeat music)
