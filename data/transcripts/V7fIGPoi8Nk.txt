[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Previously on Grace To You. What is the true nature of a Christian's relationship to Christ?
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:14.920]   Abide in me and I in you. The creator God of the universe, the infinitely holy triune God
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.820]   lives in you. What does it mean to be a Christian? It means, listen, God lives in you.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.860]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:37.340]   I determine to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:01:01.660]   Open your Bible to the fifteenth chapter of John's gospel, John chapter 15. This is a
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.380]   very definitive chapter.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.380]   .
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:12.980]   If you go to John 13, we come to the Passover on Thursday night of Passion Week; and, of
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.180]   course, Christ is crucified on Friday. So this is the last night before His crucifixion,
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.000]   and He celebrates the Passover with the twelve disciples. And at that Passover meal, which
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.140]   strings out late into that very night, and during a subsequent walk after they left the
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.420]   upper room and headed for the...
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.300]   the garden where they would be called to pray with Him, and where He would be arrested
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.820]   and then taken to a false trial and crucified the next day. All of those hours that He spent
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.260]   with these men were critical hours for Him to deposit promises to them.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.620]   Thirteen to sixteen of John's gospel is the composite account of all that He promised
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.460]   to them and to us as well.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:13.340]   There's nothing like it in Scripture. It is the most wonderful, rich legacy of Jesus to
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.500]   His own beloved people.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.800]   But there was that night a stark reality of the presence of a false disciple, a hypocrite,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.860]   who had not yet been discovered by the other eleven disciples. The Lord had always known
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.820]   about Judas, but the others had not.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:45.100]   In fact, there were no apparent reasons given by Judas, either in his language or behavior,
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:53.380]   that would indicate to them that he was false, that he would be a defector and an apostate,
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.960]   and walk away and betray Jesus. There were no obvious reasons to believe that he was
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:13.080]   a tool of Satan, that Satan would actually enter into him, and he would go out to perpetrate
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.640]   the sale of the Savior. He was well embedded among the other eleven.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.420]   And when our Lord said, "One of you will betray Me," they were all more prone to think it
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.920]   might be them than Him.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   The Lord said, "One of you will betray Me." They were all more prone to think it might
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920]   be them than Him. The Lord said, "One of you will betray Me." They were all more prone to think it might be them than Him.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.920]   But as this evening goes on, the drama of Judas, of course, unfolds.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.080]   So let's look at the opening eleven verses of chapter 15.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:55.520]   And you will see in what our Lord says here two kinds of branches, two kinds of disciples:
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.320]   those who remain and bear fruit, and those who leave and are burned.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.560]   And in the background is Judas.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.480]   Our Lord says, "I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.020]   Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.640]   it so that it may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of the word which I
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.220]   have spoken to you."
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.660]   He could say that, by the way, because Judas was gone; the remaining eleven were clean.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.320]   And then He instructs them, "Abide in Me."
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.840]   "And I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.780]   neither can you unless you abide in Me.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.440]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.480]   He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.820]   If anyone does not abide in Me, he's thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.580]   them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.200]   If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   for you."
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.620]   "My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be My disciples.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.920]   Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.860]   If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.080]   commandments and abide in His love.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.960]   These things I have spoken to you, so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.560]   be made full."
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.000]   We're talking about abiding in Christ, and we're looking at this very graphic illustration,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.500]   metaphor, word picture.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.340]   Jesus likens Himself to a vine, and the Father is the one who cares for the vine.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.120]   As you know, the Father was the one who cared for Jesus.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.980]   Certainly He cared for Him at the time of His temptation when He sent angels from heaven
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.720]   to minister to Him.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.920]   But He met His every need through His incarnation and humiliation.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.980]   He did only what the Father showed Him to do, told Him to do.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.920]   He submitted completely to the Father.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.860]   The Father cared for the true vine.
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.080]   In the true vine there are branches.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.480]   There are branches, according to verse 2, that bear fruit, and there are branches that
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.060]   do not bear fruit.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.320]   Branches that bear fruit are purged, pruned to bear more fruit.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.920]   Branches that do not bear fruit are taken away.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.280]   And verse 6 says, "Thrown away.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.640]   Dried up.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.040]   Gathered.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.120]   Cast into the fire and burned."
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:44.500]   This leads us to contemplate the question that is essentially referred to in verse 8:
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   "And so prove to be My disciples."
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.720]   How do you prove to be a true disciple?
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.620]   How do you prove to be a true disciple?
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.640]   What is the nature of a true relationship to Jesus Christ?
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.280]   What is the nature of that?
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.900]   How do you define that?
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.560]   How are we to understand what it means to be connected to Christ?
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.700]   How are we to understand the spiritual reality of our union with God?
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:21.420]   What does Scripture say about the Christian's relationship to the Lord?
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.600]   This is very, very important, critically important, because in Matthew 7, Jesus said, "Many will
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.000]   say to Me, 'Lord, Lord.'"
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.120]   "We did this in Your name and that in Your name, and I'll say to them, 'Depart from Me,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.780]   I never knew you.'"
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.420]   And He went on in that Sermon on the Mount to conclude by saying, "There are people who
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.460]   will build a religious house on sand, and when judgment comes, it'll collapse."
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.520]   We live in a time when we see that.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.200]   When our Lord gave those statements to the disciples, of course the church hadn't even
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.160]   been born, and now here we are, and we look at a world where Christianity is massive,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.360]   at least what claims to be.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.240]   What claims to be Christianity is massive.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.420]   There are always going to be false Christians.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:11.660]   So the question is, how do you prove to be a true disciple?
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.440]   Not only how do others know you're a true disciple, but more importantly, how do you
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   know?
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:25.540]   This is a critical, critical question, the most critical of all questions to ask, and
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.720]   it is answered here.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.280]   And we're going to pick it up at verse 4: "Abide in Me, abide in Me."
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.260]   The word "abide" is used ten times in this passage.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.940]   John uses it again in 1 John 4, 1 John 5.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.480]   We may have time to look at those in just a minute.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.240]   "Abide."
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.160]   I know that is a kind of an old word, and it sort of has spiritual overtones.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.840]   It's simply the Greek verb meno, to stay, remain.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.080]   Don't leave.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.820]   Don't go.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.440]   In effect, don't do what Judas did.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.320]   Don't walk away from Christ.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.160]   Stay, remain.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.160]   Don't leave.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.760]   Don't defect.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.120]   Don't become an apostate.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:25.320]   This is his word to the eleven remaining disciples: "Continue to believe.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.160]   Continue to be faithful."
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.080]   This is a call to anyone and everyone who is attached to Christianity and could be in
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.900]   danger of departing.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.340]   If it happens, 1 John 2:19 says, "They went out from us because they were not of us."
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:51.000]   If you're in any sense like Judas, connected to Christianity, don't walk away.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.320]   Many had done that.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   Chapter 6.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   "There was a wholesale exodus.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   There was a wholesale exodus.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.780]   There was a wholesale exodus of people who were called disciples who walked no more with
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.780]   Him."
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:06.820]   Judas is no solitary figure even in the gospel of John, but he is the archetypal defector.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.660]   We've all lived long enough as Christians probably to have seen someone who professed
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:18.320]   a faith in Christ turn and walk away.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.060]   Our Lord says, "Don't do that.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.940]   Don't do that."
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:29.980]   And then He gives promises to those who stay.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.320]   What is the value of abiding?
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.900]   Why should I stay?
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.540]   Well, the passage, starting in verse 4 and going down to verse 11, lists a series of
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.540]   promises to those who remain, who stay.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.540]   What is eternal life?
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.400]   It's not something you're going to get in the future.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.940]   It's something you possess now.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.760]   You shall have eternal life.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.300]   What is eternal life?
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.160]   Eternal life must be the life of God, because it can't be the life of man or any other created
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   being.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.720]   So eternal life is the life of God.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.800]   So believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall have life.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.540]   You shall live.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.060]   He that has the Son has life.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.680]   John 14:6, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   What is salvation?
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.660]   It is having the life of God in you, the eternal life of God.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:29.500]   The life of God is not separate from God, and so salvation is stated in that fourth
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:37.340]   verse in these words: "Abide in Me, and I in you, and I in you."
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:44.400]   Or in verse 5, the abiding branch, "I in Him, I in you."
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.160]   How do you define a Christian?
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.520]   Not somebody who believes something only, although there is a necessity of believing.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.740]   Not someone who is connected to sound doctrine, although that's essential.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.700]   Not someone who belongs to a church, although that certainly is important.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.600]   The best way to define a Christian is that Christ lives in that person, that He possesses
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.280]   that eternal life which belongs only to God.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.880]   So when somebody asks you, "What does it mean to be a Christian?" you tell them it means
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.380]   that the triune God of the universe.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:30.480]   "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit has taken up residence in Me."
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:39.600]   Now you have the responsibility to convince the person that that's true by the manifestation
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.040]   of God through your life.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.500]   And that took us to the second thing that we looked at last time, the second promise.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.260]   The first is salvation.
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.620]   God takes up residence in you.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.240]   The second is fruitfulness.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.440]   "For again, as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine" - that's
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.500]   the agricultural illustration - "so neither can you unless you abide in Me.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.100]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.980]   He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing."
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:14.220]   It starts out negative in verse 4, then it becomes positive in verse 5, then it goes
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.600]   back to negative at the end of verse 5.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.100]   Bottom line: "Only as you abide in Him."
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:29.740]   "And He abides in you, can you bear much fruit."
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.700]   Much fruit.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:37.940]   This fruit then, according to verse 8, becomes the proof that you're a disciple.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.060]   That's what verse 8 says: "My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.640]   prove to be My disciple."
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:51.960]   So that is the only way we know that we are disciples of Christ, that are genuine, that
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.500]   we are branches connected to the vine.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:04.340]   Now we are told to bear fruit in this section, to bear more fruit, and that God is glorified
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.700]   when we bear much fruit.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:12.020]   There is a progression here that is very important for us to understand.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:21.820]   There is a progression in our lives, a progression related to abiding and remaining.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:31.480]   It's illustrated well in a couple of passages that I'll show you, most notably Colossians
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.240]   1:9.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.200]   Paul says this: "For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.060]   to pray for you and ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:48.940]   wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.680]   Him in all respects."
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:15:04.120]   Bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, increasing.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:12.760]   Philippians chapter 3, familiar words, the testimony of Paul who was certainly fruitful,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:21.540]   but he said, "I have not already obtained, already become perfect, but I press.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:27.660]   I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.700]   Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.660]   One thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:41.860]   press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:49.920]   As we abide in Christ, and as we yield to Christ, and as we increase in the knowledge
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.400]   of Christ.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.520]   Our fruitfulness increases.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:01.580]   By every means of grace, by every means of grace, our abiding is deeper and wider and
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:09.880]   higher and richer, and we become more fruitful.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:17.380]   So there has to be in our abiding an increasing commitment to Christ, which then makes us
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.260]   more fruitful.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.240]   Repentance, it means that our repentance comes as we grow in grace and in the knowledge
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.580]   of Christ, our repentance comes more readily, comes more rapidly, comes more frequently.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:37.480]   It's a mark of spiritual maturity to be a repenter.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:45.900]   If we give evidence, 1 John 1:9 says, "If we give evidence that we repent by confessing
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.120]   our sins, we demonstrate that He is faithful and just to be for us."
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.420]   Forgiving our sins, present tense.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:17:00.300]   If we are the people confessing, we are the people giving evidence that we are being forgiven.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.400]   So the first thing that I would just suggest to you with regard to fruit is that it's an
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.260]   attitude that basically dominates our life.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:15.220]   Resentment of the sin that is in us, not the consequence, but the reality of sin.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.980]   That's fruit that proves you're a true disciple.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.980]   Secondly, spiritual attitudes.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.820]   Another kind of fruit, first repentance, another kind of fruit, spiritual attitudes.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:31.460]   Galatians 5:22, "The fruit of the Spirit is - " the fruit of the Spirit who dwells in
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:36.240]   us is " - this is the product, this is the manifestation of the life of the Trinity in
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.860]   us: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.300]   Those are attitudes, are they not?
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   Those are attitudes.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Those aren't acts.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.380]   Those aren't behaviors.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.840]   They're what's behind behaviors.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:18:00.080]   So here, clearly, fruit is virtuous, spiritual attitudes.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:07.300]   Thirdly, another kind of fruit, and I'm just taking you to Scriptures that demonstrate
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.020]   this, a third and very important aspect of fruit.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:17.340]   Go to the thirteenth chapter of Hebrews for just a moment, Hebrews, chapter 13, verse
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.860]   15.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.700]   Here is instruction.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:27.460]   "That through Him" - that is through Christ; without Him we can do nothing, right?
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.140]   Again, it's through Him.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.940]   He is mentioned in verse 12 as the one who sanctified His people through His own blood.
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:45.440]   "Through Him who lives in us, the true vine from which we draw our life, through Him then
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.560]   let us once in a while, every Sunday, continually."
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:54.240]   "Offer up a sacrifice of praise to God."
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.320]   That is the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.820]   That's worship.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.820]   That's fruit.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.100]   That's the fruit of your lips - worship.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:10.060]   What is fruit then in your life as a believer that manifests the Trinity is in you?
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.900]   One, it is continual repentance.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:19.420]   Two, it is attitudes that are Christ-like attitudes: love, joy, peace, gentleness, goodness, faith,
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.420]   meekness, self-control.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:29.760]   And it is praise that really gives back to God a true representation of who He is, as
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.160]   the God revealed in the Old Testament, and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.800]   revealed in the New, the triune God; and praising Him, and thanking Him, and glorifying Him
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.860]   for all that He is and all that He has done.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.280]   Let me give you another component, a fourth.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.280]   Philippians 4.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.240]   And this just kind of digs down a little deep in a more specific way.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:03.340]   In Philippians, chapter 4, the apostle Paul was obviously in need, very difficult times
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:10.600]   for him, and dear friends sent him gifts.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:16.280]   They sent him supplies, food, and he was extremely grateful.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.140]   In fact, in verse 16 of Philippians 4, "I am grateful to the Lord for my life, and I
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.140]   am grateful to the Lord for my life."
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:28.740]   He reminds them that when he was in Thessalonica, they sent a gift more than once for his need.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.440]   They were very, very generous and loving toward him.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.580]   In verse 17 he says this: "Not that I seek the gift."
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.180]   This is the pure heart of Paul.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:46.120]   "Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit" - N-A-S says - "for the profit
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.820]   which increases to your account."
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.000]   That word "prophet" is not the word "prophet."
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.120]   It is "karpon" in Greek.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   It is "karpon."
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.900]   It is the word "fruit."
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.760]   It is the word "karpon," which is just the Greek word for "fruit."
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.360]   "Thanks for the gift.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:08.020]   I'm so glad you sent the gift, not because I want the gift, but I want the fruit that
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.800]   increases to your account."
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.760]   He saw that gift, that expression of love as spiritual fruit produced through them by
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.860]   the indwelling God.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:27.520]   It is the similar significance of chapter 15 of Romans.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.300]   Macedonia and Achaia, 1526, have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.420]   the saints of Jerusalem.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.120]   These Gentile churches were sending money to Jerusalem for poor believers.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.660]   They were pleased to do so.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.060]   They're indebted to them, for if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they're
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.640]   indebted to minister to them also in material things.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.720]   In other words, the gospel came through the Jews and came first to them, and then through
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   them.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.280]   And so the Gentiles are sending a gift.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.540]   Verse 28: "Therefore when I have finished this and have put my seal on this fruit of
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.740]   theirs, I'll go on my way to Spain."
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:07.540]   He saw the Gentiles sending money to poor Jews in Jerusalem as spiritual fruit.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.840]   So we could add something else to the list.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.580]   Spiritual fruit is contributions to those in need, contributions to those in need.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.580]   Let me give you a fifth illustration.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.820]   Element of fruit.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.820]   First Corinthians 14.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.760]   Yeah, you know what's going on in First Corinthians 14.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.940]   Some of you do.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.780]   Chaos in the Corinthian church with tongues and all kinds of chaos, as everybody was doing
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.840]   whatever they wanted in the services.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.200]   Paganism had encroached on the worship.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:48.120]   And so Paul wants to call a halt to all this nonsense, all this meaningless talk.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.440]   So he says, "I'm going to go to the church.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   I'm going to go to the church.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.440]   I'm going to go to the church."
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.340]   Now, in verse 14, "If I pray in a language, another language, my spirit prays, my mind
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.340]   is unfruitful.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:03.860]   If I'm praying in a language I don't know, my mind is not engaged."
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.200]   So what is the outcome?
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.880]   "I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the mind also.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the mind also.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.840]   I'm not going to be engaged in things that I don't understand and you don't understand.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.400]   What's the point?"
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:26.640]   Otherwise, if you bless in the Spirit only, how will the one who fills the place of the
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:34.280]   ungifted say the "amen" at your giving of thanks, since he doesn't know what you're
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.260]   saying?
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:41.680]   This would be, according to verse 14, unfruitful, unfruitful.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.840]   So you want to be fruitful?
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.940]   Say things that edify.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.260]   That's another kind of fruit.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.240]   Communication that edifies.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.040]   Communication that blesses.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   Communication that instructs.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.120]   It may be in a prayer.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.840]   It may be in a teaching environment.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.540]   It may be in a conversation.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:03.500]   It may be in a counseling or discipling setting.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.500]   Now another one.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.140]   I'll give you two more.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.440]   Pure conduct, pure behavior.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.760]   We've got to get to behavior, all right?
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   We've talked about repentance internal.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.260]   We've talked about virtues internal.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.120]   We've talked about worship.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.080]   That starts in the heart and reaches out.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.280]   Now we're starting to reach out.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.500]   Communication that blesses others.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.120]   And then pure conduct, just pure conduct, righteous behavior.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   Philippians 1:11, "Being filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.360]   Christ."
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:43.260]   Or Colossians 1:9 and 10, it says essentially the same thing, "So that you will walk in
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.980]   a manner worthy of the Lord to please Him in all respect, bearing fruit in every good
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.980]   work."
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:57.240]   Hebrews 12:11 essentially says the same thing.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   General conduct.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.260]   So now we've talked about repentance, and we've talked about the idea of manifesting
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.840]   Christlike virtues on the inside.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.340]   Worship, contributions of love to the people in need, communication that blesses others,
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.800]   a life of righteous behavior and conduct.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   This is fruit.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.840]   And this is how you prove.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   You're a real disciple.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.300]   One final one.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.120]   Bringing people to Christ, that's fruit.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:35.600]   John 4, when Jesus was talking to the woman at the well in Samaria, He was speaking to
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.120]   the disciples as the Samaritans were kind of coming out of the village toward Him.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.700]   In verse 34, He said, "My food is to do the will of the One who sent Me and accomplish
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   His work.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.700]   Do not say there are four months, and then comes the harvest."
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.660]   That would have been the agricultural calendar.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.660]   Don't say that.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.200]   "Look, lift up your eyes.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   Look on the fields.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   They're white for harvest."
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   And I think you saw the Samaritans coming across the fields.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:06.120]   "And already He who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for life eternal, so
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.600]   that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together."
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.700]   Sometimes you get to sow, sometimes you get to reap, sometimes you get to sow and reap,
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.700]   right?
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.560]   Or in the language of 1 Corinthians, one sows, one waters, and God gives water.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.720]   He gives the what?
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.940]   The increase.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.320]   This is fruit.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.420]   This is fruit.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:32.340]   That is, I think, the most wonderful fruit because it's the end product of everything
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.400]   else.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.420]   If you live a life that resents and resists sin, if you live a life that pursues holiness,
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:44.760]   if you live a life of worship, if you live a life with the right kind of spiritual attitudes,
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.420]   if you live a life that does good to others, shows love to them.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.900]   If you manifest general righteousness, your life will have a powerful testimony.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:01.600]   And when you say the triune God lives in you, there will be something to support that claim.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:08.260]   That makes the gospel attractive, and the Lord will use you to lead others to salvation.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:13.420]   Christ communicated truths throughout Scripture practically.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.260]   Look at the parables, metaphors, and allusions He made.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.180]   He desires for His people to understand the truth.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:22.180]   He desires for His people to understand truths that could otherwise be complicated.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:29.000]   In John 15, He uses the metaphor of the vine and branches, agriculture and nature, something
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.140]   every person alive understands to some extent.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.460]   We see the seasons change.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.540]   We see land in the midst of drought or rainy seasons.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.840]   We reap the benefits of a good harvest and the things we can cook and eat.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.320]   We know what a healthy plant looks like and what it can produce.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.040]   Christ is the vine.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.040]   We are the branches.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:55.540]   If we are in Christ, as Pastor John pointed out, we produce spiritual fruit, repentance,
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:02.580]   spiritual attitudes like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.320]   gentleness, and self-control.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.480]   Are these things evident in your life today?
