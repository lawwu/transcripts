[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Two of your major themes, Pastor John, are God's sovereignty and the centrality of
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.200]   joy in God, and last time in episode 116, we talked about the joy of Calvinism and
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.480]   God's joy as the foundation of our joy. But you wanted a second half to explain
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.040]   how Christian hedonism and Calvinism connect, so explain this for us.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.720]   Tony, last time when you posed this question to me about sovereignty of God
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.000]   and joy, I said that God's joy in the fellowship of the Trinity is the
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.620]   foundation of His sovereignty and the overflow of His sovereignty as God
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.720]   creates the world to share in the joy that He has in Him. So now the
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:58.560]   question becomes more specifically, in this world there is so much sorrow. We
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.000]   are disappointed again and again. We're discouraged, we suffer, we fail, we're
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.320]   assaulted, we get sick, we die. Day after day, it seems to me, I mean, I feel that
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.540]   the world is attacking our joy in God, our family's joy in God, our church's
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.240]   joy in God, our nation's joy. We're constantly being assailed by things that
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.320]   threaten our joy, and the question is, how does God's sovereignty work to help us
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.200]   fight for joy in God, because joy in God is the reason we're made, and it's what
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:48.660]   glorifies God. And the answer comes in Romans 8 28 and 8 32 and Genesis 50
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:56.060]   verse 20. When I read, "Rejoice always," in 1 Thessalonians 5 16, I say to God, "Oh
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.100]   God, do you mean always? Really?" And I think his answer is, "Yes, but not a
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.820]   superficial smiley face, praise God anyhow, but rather with a 2nd Corinthians 6 10
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.260]   kind of answer, sorrowful yet always rejoicing, that there is a joy in God
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:28.800]   that is constant even in the midst of sorrow, in loss, and the reason that can
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.060]   be is because God in Christ has committed himself to work everything
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.200]   together for our good." Romans 8 28. And Romans 8 32 shows that Christ, in his
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.060]   dying for us and rising, is the ground of Romans 8 28. "He who did not spare his
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.020]   own Son, but gave him up for us all, will he not with him give us all things that
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.460]   he's..." Won't he work everything together for our good? So because Christ came and
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.540]   identified with us, bore our suffering, bore our sin, rose from the dead
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.420]   triumphant, took away our guilt, purchased for us all the promises of God,
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.660]   therefore God is no longer angry at us, but his sovereignty serves entirely his
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.340]   mercy toward us, and thus he is working all of our calamities and all of our
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.580]   good times together for our good, so that written over all the experiences of our
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.660]   life is Genesis 50 verse 20. "They meant it for evil, the devil meant it for evil,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.140]   my enemies meant it for evil, but God meant it for good." And I underline that
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.700]   word "meant it." God meant it for good. So this meaning of God, this intention of
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.100]   God, this purpose of God in all of our hardships is the unshakable foundation
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.900]   for my joy. So if somebody were to ask me, "How does God's sovereignty right now in
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.620]   the midst of your loss of your mom or your loss of your granddaughter or this
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.620]   crisis in your church or this cancer that you had to walk through a few years
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.660]   ago, in that very moment how does the sovereignty of God help?" I would say, "God
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.900]   means this." Not just uses. Lots of people say God's playing catch-up ball all the
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.060]   time, like he finds things he didn't know were gonna happen, he says, "Oh, well I can
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.900]   make something of that." No, no, no, no. That's not what the Bible says. God meant
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.820]   it for good. So this cancer is coming from him, this loss is coming from him,
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.180]   this pain is coming from him, and he means it, he intends it, he purposes it
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.460]   for my good. And I know it's for my good because Christ bought it and he says
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.260]   that everything's gonna work together for my good. The older...when I was thinking
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.100]   about this, Tony, I just thought my mind situation here, and I'm 67, and this is
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.980]   what came to my mind. The older I get, the more thankful I become for God's
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.980]   sovereign keeping power. Jude 124, a lot of people don't don't see this when they
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.020]   read it, it says, "Now to him who is able," now that word "able," dunitas, means
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.700]   powerful. You could say sovereignly powerful, sovereignly able. God is
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.500]   sovereignly committed and able to keep John Piper from stumbling and to present
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.100]   him blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy. So if you ask me
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.900]   then, "How does the sovereignty of God relate to my joy?" That verse says, "God's
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.500]   sovereign power and pledge to keep me from making shipwreck of my faith is
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:57.940]   intended to lead me now and in the end to great joy." And my love for my enemy, or
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.620]   people I just have a hard time with, flows out of this joy. Loving people and
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.860]   worshiping God. Romans 12, "Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, don't
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.180]   return evil for evil, don't avenge yourselves." Why? Because you can hand it
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.020]   over to God. Why? Because vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord. In other
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.780]   words, God's sovereignty has such a control over this world that if I think
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.340]   my enemy is getting the upper hand and that's tending to make me angry or
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.860]   bitter or vengeful, I must remember, "No, no, no, no. God is sovereign. Nobody gets
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.380]   away with anything. All accounts will be settled either on the cross if they
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.180]   repent or in hell if they don't." And so you can love them, you can love your
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.940]   enemy, you can feed him. If your enemy's hungry, feed him. If he's thirsty, give
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.740]   him something to drink. You'll heat burning coals on his head. Don't be
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.700]   overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. So the sovereignty of God maintains
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.820]   my joy, not just for me, Tony, but for my enemy and for the world and for my
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.020]   ministry in the world to keep on going when it looks like the world is
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.700]   just spinning out of control in sin and corruption. It's not. God is sovereign. All
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.580]   accounts will be settled, and that enables me then just to keep on loving.
