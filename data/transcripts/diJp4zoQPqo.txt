[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.900]   which we started with quite amusing actually because
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.700]   The main reason we launched with use mod wiki is that it was a single pearl script
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.020]   So it was really easy for me to install it on the server and just get running
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.440]   but it was
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.980]   You know some guys hobby project. It was cool, but it was just a hobby project and
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.840]   All the data was stored
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.860]   in flat
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:42.860]   The data was stored in flat text

[00:08:42.860 --> 00:09:12.900]  , so there was no real database behind it so that to search the site you basically used grab which is just like basic units utility to like look through all the files so that clearly was never going to scale but also in the early days it didn't have real log in so you could set your username but there were no passwords so you know I might say Bob Smith and then someone else comes along and says I'm Bob Smith and they both had it now that never really happened we didn't have a problem with it but it was kind of obvious like you can't have a problem with it but it was kind of obvious like you can't have a problem with it
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:42.940]   grow a big website where everybody can pretend to be everybody that's that's not going to be good for trust and reputation and so forth so quickly I had to write a little you know log in you know store people's passwords and things like that so you can have unique identities and then another example of something you know quite he would have never thought would have been a good idea and it turned out to not be a problem but to make a link in Wikipedia in the early days you would make a link to a page that may or may not exist by just using camel case meaning it's like up and down and you know you can't make a link to a page that may or may not exist by just using camel case meaning it's like up

[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:56.300]   yes it's sad yeah yeah so there's a few things to unpack and all that so first
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.200]   one of the things I find really always
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   The most interesting part of being a part of the community is the fact that we're not just a group of people who are just being treated as if we're part of the community.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   The most interesting part of being a part of the community is that we're not just a group of people who are just being treated as if we're part of the community.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   The most interesting part of being a part of the community.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   So I think it's really important to have a group of people who are just being treated as if we're part of the community.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   So I think it's really important to have a group of people who are just being treated as if we're part of the community.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:27.800]  ,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   So I think it's really important to have a group of people who are just being treated as if we're part of the community.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:27.840]   So I think it's really important to have a group of people who are just being treated as if we're part of the community.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:27.880]   So I think it's really important to have a group of people who are just being treated as if we're part of the community.

[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   We've seen a real rise in clickbait headlines and sort of eager focus on anything that might be controversial. We've always had that with us, of course. There's always been tabloid newspapers. But that makes it a little bit more challenging to say, okay, how do we sort things out when we have a pretty good sense that not every source is valid?
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.080]   So
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   a little bit more challenging to say, okay, how do we sort things out when we have a pretty good sense that not every source is valid? So

[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   and so forth. And you really have to step back and go, hmm, is this really encyclopedic or is this just the Daily Mail going on a rant?
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   And some of that requires a great community health. It requires massive community health.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   Even for me, for stuff I've seen that's kind of actually iffy about people I know, things I know about myself, I still feel out of my comfort zone.

[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   Yeah, a great example that I really loved this morning that I saw someone left a note on my user talk page in English Wikipedia saying it was quite a dramatic headline thing. Racist hook on front page. We have on the front page of Wikipedia we have a little section called "Did you know?" and it's just little tidbits and facts as things people find interesting. There's a whole process for how things get there.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   and there's a whole process for how things get there.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:25.140]   and there's a process for how things get there's not conducive.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   The one that somebody was raising a question about was comparing a very well known U.S. football player, black, there was a quote from another famous sport person comparing him to a Lamborghini. Clearly a compliment.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   and so somebody said actually here's a study here's some interesting information about how black sports people are far more often compared to inanimate objects
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   and so somebody said actually here's a study here's some interesting information about how black sports people are far more often compared to inanimate objects

[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   We think is great and so we should probably think about how to improve our language and not not compare sports people to inanimate objects and particularly be aware of certain racial sensitivities that there might be around that sort of thing if there is a disparity in the media of how people are called.

Now, it is a bit anodyne and it's a bit cliched. So sometimes it just takes the spirit out of something that's actually not bad.

[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:20.220]   - I doubt if the main article, Moon, it may mention, geez, probably not even, because it's not credible and it's not even meant to be serious by anyone. Or the article on the Earth certainly won't have a paragraph that says, well, most scientists think it's round, but certain people think flat. Like, that's just a silly thing to put in that article. You would want to sort of address, you know, that's an interesting cultural phenomenon. You want to put it somewhere.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:20.220]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:49.560]   ado. So, this, you know, this goes into all kinds of things about politics. You want to be really careful, really thoughtful about not getting caught up in the anger of our times and really recognize. You know, I always thought, I remember being really kind of proud of the U.S. at the time when it was, McCain was running against Obama. Because I thought, oh, I've got plenty of disagreements with both of them.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:49.560]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:49.560]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:49.560]   - Mm-hmm.

[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.520]   I would venture to guess, I don't know the data.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.280]   Maybe you can, ,, let me know.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:33.880]   But the personal political leaning of the group of people who edit Wikipedia
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.060]   probably leans left.
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.060]   I would guess.
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:41.020]   So to me, the question there is, I mean, the same is true for Silicon Valley.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.480]   The task for Silicon Valley is to create platforms that are not politically biased.

There's so many interpretations. So I would like to see less of this. But if you get that kind of signal, it actually can create a really powerfully curated list of content that is fed to you every day. That doesn't create an echo chamber or a silo. It actually just makes you feel good.

[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:38.280]   The British seem to argue more intensely, like they're invigorated, they're energized by the debate. Those people, I often disagree with basically everybody involved and it's so fun. I learned something. That's high quality. If we could do that, if there's some way for me to click a button that says filter out lower quality just today.

[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:07.860]   The composition of the community is really important,
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:11.240]   not because Wikipedia is or should be a battleground,
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:13.100]   but because blind spots.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.500]   Like, maybe I don't even realize what's biased.
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.280]   If I'm particularly of a certain point of view
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:20.160]   and I've never thought much about it.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:23.120]   So one of the things we focus on a lot,
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.660]   the Wikipedia volunteers are,
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.760]   we don't know the exact number,
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:31.360]   but let's say 80% plus male.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.860]   And they're of a certain demographic,
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:32.860]   - Yeah. - and they're of a certain demographic,
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:32.860]   - Yeah. - and they're of a certain demographic,

[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.780]   but we do think, okay, you know what?
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.880]   That does lead to some problems.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.080]   It leads to some content issues simply because people write
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.620]   more about what they know and what they're interested in.
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:18.820]   They'll tend to be dismissive of things as being unimportant
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:20.760]   if it's not something that they personally
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:21.800]   have an interest in.

[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.740]   probably aren't as good as they should be.
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:32.940]   Because a lot of the Wikipedia volunteers
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   - Yeah. - are not as good
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   as they should be.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   There's a lot of the Wikipedia volunteers
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   that are interested in,
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   I would say our entries on early childhood development

[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:32.940]   I mean,
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:46:02.980]   but I think it's a good thing.
[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:02.980]   But, but I think it's a good thing.

[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.020]   And why is that? Well, it's not because,
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:09.060]   Well, it's not because,
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.960]   Well, it's not because, 'cause I know hundreds of Wikipedians.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.020]   'Cause I know hundreds of Wikipedians.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.940]   'Cause I know hundreds of Wikipedians. It's not because these are a bunch of
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:17.500]   It's not because these are a bunch of biased, sexist men who are like,
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:17.540]   biased, sexist men who are like,

[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:20.980]   books by women are not important. It's like, no, actually, there is a,
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:41.180]   gender kind of breakdown of readership.
[01:46:41.180 --> 01:46:41.240]   gender kind of breakdown of readership.
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:45.240]   gender kind of breakdown of readership. There are books, like hard science fiction,
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:45.280]   There are books, like hard science fiction,
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.140]   There are books, like hard science fiction, is a classic example, hard science fiction,
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:47.220]   is a classic example, hard science fiction,
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:49.240]   is a classic example, hard science fiction, mostly read by men.
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:49.320]   mostly read by men.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.020]   mostly read by men. Other types of novels more read by
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.020]   Other types of novels more read by women. And if we don't have women in the
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.020]   And if we don't have women in the community, then these award-winning,
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.020]   And if we don't have women in the community, then these award-winning, clearly important novelists may have less coverage.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.020]   And not because anybody consciously thinks, oh, we don't like, what, a book by,
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:47:21.060]   a book by, who cares, she's a poet, like that's not interesting. No, but just because people write what they know, they write what they're interested in it. So we do think diversity in the community is really important and that's one area where I do think it's really clear, but I can also say, you know what actually that also applies in the political sphere like to say actually we do want kind and thoughtful Catholic priests kind and conservatives kind of thoughtful conservatives kind of thoughtful libertarians kind of thoughtful libertarians kind of

You know, if you want to keep going, you might want to learn how to format a footnote and to be friendly and to be open and to say, "Oh right, oh you're new and you clearly don't know everything about Wikipedia." And you know sometimes in any community that can be quite hard. So people come in and they've got a great big idea and they're gonna propose this to the Wikipedia community and they have no idea. That's basically a perennial discussion we've had 7000 times before. And so

[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:51.260]   - Yeah, and that's kind of human, you know. But I think it just does require really thinking, you know, in a self-aware manner of like, "Oh, I'm not sure I can do this."

[02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:58.780]   Finanzi: So, when you say, you wanna have discussions with the Chinese government or with organizations like CDC, WHO, it's to thoroughly understand what the mainstream narrative is, so that it can be properly represented, but not drive what the articles are. Well, I, it's actually important to say, like, whatever the Wikimedia Foundation thinks has no impact on what's in Wikipedia.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:26:58.780]   Right.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:26:58.780]   So,
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:27.160]   It's more about saying to them, "Right, we understand you're the World Health Organization or you're whoever, and part of your job is just sort of public health, it's about communications. You wanna understand the world." So, it's more about, "Oh, well, let's explain how Wikipedia works." So, it's more about explaining how Wikipedia works and like, "Hey, it's the volunteers." Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's a battle of ideas and here's how the sources are used.
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:27.160]   Yeah, exactly. It's a battle of ideas and here's how the sources are used.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:55.540]  , what are legitimate sources and what not are legitimate sources. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I suppose there's some battle about what is a legitimate source. There could be statements made that CDC, I mean, like, there's government organizations in general have sold themselves to be the place where you go for expertise. And some of that has been, to a small degree, raised in question over the responsibility of the government.
[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:55.660]   Yeah, exactly.

[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.580]   Well, I think in many cases, and this goes back to my topic of trust. So there were definitely cases of public officials, public organizations, where I felt like they lost the trust of the public because they didn't trust the public.

Where I personally know there's a lot of incredible scientists doing incredible work. And I have to blame the leaders for the effects on the distrust and the scientific work that they're doing. Because of what I perceive as basic human flaws of communication, of arrogance, of ego, of politics, all those kinds of things.

[02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:11.040]   push was made to fight bias at Wikipedia.
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:15.200]   Our target became getting the Hitler article to be Wiki's featured article.
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:22.540]   The idea was that the voting body only wanted articles that were good PR, and especially articles about socially liberal topics.
[02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:29.380]   So, the Hitler article had to be two to three times better and more academically researched to beat the competition.
[02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:31.380]   This bias seems to hold today.
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:37.240]   For example, the current list of political featured articles, at a glance, seems to have only two books.

[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:17.160]   But in this case, it was like, actually, part of the point is the swastika symbol is from other cultures as well.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:18.400]   And they just thought it was interesting.
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:20.520]   I did joke to the committee.
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:25.080]   I'm like, please don't put the swastika on the front page without warning me because I'm going to get a lot.
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:26.220]   Now it wouldn't be me.
[02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:26.860]   It's the foundation.
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:28.400]   I'm not that much on the front lines.
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:36.740]   And so I would say that to put Hitler on the front page of Wikipedia, it is a special topic and you would want to say, yeah,

[02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:18.660]   In the theory of humor and comedy and a lot of famous comedians and humorous have written about it.
