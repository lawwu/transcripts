[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   - They've squeezed as much revenue as they can
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.360]   out of the iPhone.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.560]   Services seems like the best place for them to make money,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.840]   but as we see, the App Store is under assault.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.080]   - It's a little bit of a head scratcher
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.960]   what's going on over there.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.240]   They should launch a huge competitor to AWS, Azure, and GCP.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.160]   Every developer that Apple has
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.600]   theoretically could have been running
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.820]   not just on Apple's SDK and APIs,
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.440]   but they should be running in an Apple Cloud.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.920]   That would have been an incredible way
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.480]   to defend a 30% rev share.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.100]   Okay, listen, I'm taking 30%,
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.440]   but here's a bunch of subsidized access to hardware.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.960]   And the market would have loved it.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.320]   And in this AI shift, they can still do that.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.160]   The most valuable thing they could do
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.400]   would be to launch a big cloud.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.560]   - They have all the app developers on test flight
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.400]   ready to go. - They have all of them.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.440]   - They just email them and say,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.640]   "Hey, here's your free storage."
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.040]   I mean, they could just slowly add features.
