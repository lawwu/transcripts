[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.120]   And in this episode, I want to talk about being an elite.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.600]   Because being an elite sounds great.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.560]   You're at the top of your profession.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.840]   Maybe you're the top politician.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.000]   You're the top player.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.120]   You're at the top whatever.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.120]   So if you're in the top 0.1%, 99.9% of the people
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.600]   aren't there.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.120]   So you feel special.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.280]   And who doesn't want to feel special?
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.140]   I know I do.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.120]   I know my kids do.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.840]   We all want to feel special.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.840]   But as I was writing a new post about the New York Times
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.260]   workers going on strike, I realized something very important.
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.800]   And that is none of us really should want to be identified
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.480]   as an elite.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.800]   Because to be an elite means to be exclusionary
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.440]   instead of inclusionary.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.040]   Any grade school student and every single parent
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.200]   understands the importance of being inclusive.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.240]   We want to include people from different backgrounds,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.560]   different sexes, cultures, races, and so forth.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.200]   Because we want our kids to grow up to be kind,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.120]   thoughtful, empathetic, not assholes, not racist,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.800]   not bigots, not sexist, none of that stuff.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.820]   Because we want them to be helpful to society,
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.000]   make friends, not be lonely,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.600]   and just be good people overall.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.860]   Makes sense.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.320]   So if you are considered an elite,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.500]   that means you are exclusionary.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.920]   The more well-qualified people you can reject,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.520]   the more elite your institution or you might seem to be.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060]   A great example of being exclusionary,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.820]   yet telling the world that you want to help more people
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.160]   is the way top private universities
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.320]   have kept their enrollment the same.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440]   Very little movement over the decades
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.240]   despite demand surging higher and higher.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.680]   And at the same time, the tuition rates
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.040]   are also rising faster than the rate of inflation.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.280]   So as an elite university, you gain more elite status
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.440]   by rejecting more people.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.680]   You keep the enrollment the same
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.440]   despite having 10, 20, $50 billion endowment,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040]   which could easily grow your class size
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.840]   and let more people in.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   But because we all want to feel elite or be elite,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.120]   if you're an alumni or if you're a wealthy professor
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.920]   who can buy $16 million mega mansions in the Bahamas,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.080]   you might want to keep the status quo.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.440]   You might want to pull that ladder up from behind you
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.760]   so not as many people can gain
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.560]   the same amount of access and power.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.980]   So do you really want to be identified as an elite
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.860]   when you're excluding other people
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.320]   once you've got to where you've gotten
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.280]   by the help of other elite people?
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.160]   I would say no.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.960]   I would much rather be identified as a peasant,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.280]   as someone who is intellectually inferior,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.040]   but who can do what they want
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.920]   and who is actively helping other people.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.060]   I've been talking about this topic
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.960]   regarding status, prestige for many, many years.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.140]   And one of the reasons why
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.240]   is because I worked in investment banking
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   and this industry, you got paid relatively well.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.200]   So you had a lot of people
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.440]   who really chased status and prestige
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.200]   and who really couldn't quit the money
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.980]   even though they were miserable.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.180]   It was just hang on for one more year
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.300]   and you'd make another several hundred thousand dollars
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.700]   or millions of dollars.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.740]   And so this is a topic that's near and dear to my heart
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.820]   because it's very hard to quit the money.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.900]   It's very hard to let go of the desire for prestige status.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.700]   But at some point you've got to decide
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.420]   how much prestige and how much status is enough
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.740]   to take care of yourself and your family
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.540]   and whether all this stuff is really worth it.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.000]   Because if you end up doing what society wants
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.580]   instead of what you want,
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.300]   you're gonna look back on your life with regret
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.340]   for not pursuing your passions and your dreams.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.620]   I promise you this.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.740]   So let's talk about the New York Times strike.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.520]   People who write for the New York Times,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.000]   who work for the New York Times
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.140]   are considered part of the elite.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.840]   It is one of the largest publications,
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.920]   one of the oldest publications,
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.060]   and it commands the attention
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.240]   of millions and millions of readers.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.340]   And so you might be wondering,
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.060]   if you are part of the elite,
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.500]   you've got all the money, power, and access in the world,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.860]   and your kids are gonna have all the connections
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.620]   and access to the great schools and great jobs,
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.180]   why would you ever go on strike?
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.420]   You've got the best of the best that society has to offer.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.820]   Well, it turns out, like most strikes,
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.820]   the main contention point is wanting or needing more money.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.780]   The employees want more money
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.740]   and the company doesn't wanna give more money
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.300]   because the company, a publicly traded company
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.100]   like the New York Times, wants to minimize costs
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.900]   so it can maximize profits.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.860]   Makes sense.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.460]   So another epiphany that I realized
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.220]   from writing this article was that, hmm,
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.620]   no matter how much money, power, and access you have,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.060]   you might always want more.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.680]   So it goes back to the theme of how much is enough.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.220]   You've gotta understand yourself
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.740]   to think how much is enough
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.300]   because we all run out of time.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.980]   You know, I'm at 45 years old right now
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.140]   and I'm thinking, hmm, man, really?
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.500]   I could be dead in 25, 30 years.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.680]   That, life went by quick.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.420]   You wanna really figure out how much is enough
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.900]   so you can use your money to live the life that you want.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.100]   So about 14 members of the New York Times Guild
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.100]   went on strike because they wanted a pay raise of 5.25%.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.720]   Apparently, the New York Times offered half that,
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.300]   so 2.625%, and the Guild said, forget that.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.380]   We're on strike.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.220]   We're not gonna write.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.040]   We're not gonna edit.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.180]   We're not gonna do anything.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.940]   And it's somewhat surprising to see
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.360]   that New York Times management
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.760]   isn't willing to offer a 5.25% pay raise.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.860]   Supposedly, the writers haven't had a raise
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.860]   since early 2021, and they're looking for some assurances.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.060]   And we all know that inflation is rising faster than 5.25%,
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.180]   so paying 5.25% increase for the next three,
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.820]   four, or five years doesn't seem that unreasonable.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.020]   It seems kind of fair.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.360]   You're still not keeping up with inflation,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.440]   but at least nominally, you're making more money.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.740]   So I totally understand where the Guild is coming from
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.620]   and from where management is coming from
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.960]   because they wanna keep costs low
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.840]   as the Fed-induced recession is likely coming.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.560]   You know, the yield curve is majorly inverted.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.960]   The 10-year bond yield is at 3.6%,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.320]   and the one-year bond yield is at 4.7%.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.900]   That's a major inversion.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.360]   90% chance a recession is coming
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   within the next 12 to 16 months.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.620]   At the same time, at the same time,
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.080]   would you really go on strike
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.280]   if you were an elite for a 5.25% pay raise?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.000]   The company's offering 2.625%,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   so you're really going on strike for that delta,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.760]   that difference of 2.625%.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.720]   In other words, let's say you make $100,000 a year.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   Are you really gonna go on strike for an extra $2,625?
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.560]   That's tough.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.200]   That seems kinda strange if you're an elite,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.040]   if you're truly an elite.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.040]   At the same time, if you're making, let's say,
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.040]   under $50,000 a year and you live in New York City,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.760]   well, every single dollar counts
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.640]   because New York City is, in my opinion,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.840]   the most expensive city in America
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.160]   and one of the most expensive cities in the world.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.300]   So you wanna fight and you wanna show solidarity
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.680]   to your other 1,400 union members.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.600]   I'm gonna side, I would say,
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.480]   90-plus percent of the time with the employee
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.320]   because company loyalty to employees is dead.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.680]   The world is just way too competitive
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.920]   for companies to offer pensions
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.480]   and take care of employees
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.600]   on the good times and the bad times, right?
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.960]   But it is also interesting that in investment banking,
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.460]   it's completely different from media.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.920]   When we don't bring in the business,
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.960]   our compensation gets cut,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.360]   and sometimes really drastically, 20% to 70%.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.560]   I remember in 2011, I did very well with my clients,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.800]   top three with most of my largest clients,
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.200]   and yet my compensation was still cut
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.840]   because management said I had to subsidize,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.080]   subsidize the fixed income department,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   which was losing money at the time.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.840]   And I was bummed, but I didn't complain.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.240]   I certainly didn't go on strike
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.920]   because if I went on strike, they would have let me go
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.600]   or cut my compensation even further for the following year.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.760]   So instead, I devised a way to get out,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.640]   to get out and not complain at the water cooler,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.360]   to just get out by negotiating a severance
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.160]   to be free to do what I wanted to do.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.520]   There's another thing that I realized
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.640]   about the New York Times strike.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.960]   So in 2011, there was an article that came out
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.040]   called "How a Financial Pro Lost His House" by Carl Richards.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   And the gist of the article is,
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.900]   Carl bought too much house,
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.840]   was underwater by more than $200,000,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.000]   and decided to do a short sale.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.920]   A short sale is an offer of a property at an asking price
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.040]   that is less than the amount due
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.600]   on the current owner's mortgage.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.800]   Carl argued that while he had a contractual obligation
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.720]   with the bank, he had a moral obligation to his family.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.080]   That makes sense.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.520]   Therefore, he stopped paying his mortgage
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.880]   and handed back the property to the bank.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.680]   But at the time, it was a really difficult time.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.960]   I remember thinking to myself,
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.000]   ah, so here's a well-paid guy who is causing hardship
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.560]   for the rest of us who decided
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.600]   to continue paying our mortgages.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.260]   Are we really the fools here?
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.100]   Are we the dummies?
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.120]   Are we the idiots for continuing to pay our mortgages
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.440]   when the economy was collapsing?
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.800]   Because if everybody kept paying their mortgages,
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.400]   the devastating financial crisis would not have occurred
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.800]   to the extent that it did.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.840]   So I just, I remember in 2011,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.040]   very tough because we were going still through like
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.840]   two or three rounds of layoffs a year
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.720]   after six to seven rounds of layoffs in 2009 and 2010.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.640]   I also had a huge primary mortgage.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.560]   I was like a million dollars still.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.160]   And then my Lake Tahoe property,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.080]   which I erroneously bought in 2007,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.600]   was also underwater by several hundred thousand dollars.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.680]   So compensation was rightly getting slashed.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.680]   And I also wanted out.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.080]   So it was tough.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.440]   In Asian cultures, breaking a contract is dishonorable.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.880]   So to see Carl's story get celebrated
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.000]   on a large platform felt off.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.240]   And the more people who broke their mortgage contracts,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.480]   the more the economy would suffer.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.960]   And the article just made me feel dumb
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.800]   for doing the right thing.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.920]   But I couldn't break my promise.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.260]   So instead of being punished for not paying his mortgage,
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.560]   Carl Richards was rewarded by the New York Times
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.400]   with a regular financial advice column.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.360]   Once he got that regular column,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.520]   he got more exposure for his financial planning business,
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.480]   which meant more money.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.960]   Then Carl was able to land lucrative book deals.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.040]   This is a great example of heads you win,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.960]   tails you also win.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.560]   And I think it's part of being the elite.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.440]   And kudos to him.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.280]   No rational person would turn down such opportunities.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.200]   And I am thankful for Carl Richards and the New York Times
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.920]   because they enabled me to believe
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.960]   that anything was possible.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.120]   I didn't have to be perfect on my financial journey.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.800]   I just had to be honest.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.660]   And if I really messed up,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.560]   I might even get handsomely rewarded.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.480]   Think about that.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.100]   If you do well, you'll likely get rewarded.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.440]   If you do poorly, you might get rewarded even further.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.520]   How do you not get pumped up with those odds, right?
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.000]   So the very next year, I left my job
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.480]   and I haven't been back.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.960]   Finally, I wanted to share some inside baseball
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.040]   regarding the book publishing industry
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.800]   and getting on bestsellers lists.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.480]   When "Buy This, Not That" came out,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.960]   it became an instant Wall Street Journal bestseller.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.400]   And I was pumped because the Wall Street Journal
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.360]   was the newspaper that I had been reading every single day
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.480]   since I started in the finance industry in 1999.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.080]   And the bestseller list is based on a meritocracy.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.680]   It's based on how many books you sell
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.780]   during a one-week period.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.040]   However, "Buy This, Not That"
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.080]   didn't make the New York Times bestseller list,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.600]   even though based on the number of sales, it should have.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.920]   As it was explained to me by those in the publishing industry
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.440]   the New York Times bestseller list
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.760]   is not 100% based on meritocracy.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.000]   Instead, there is an editorial committee
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.160]   that decides which books get on the list.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.880]   And so the industry insiders
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.360]   went on to reveal several realities.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   One, the New York Times can do whatever they want
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.120]   because they are editorial.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.800]   Two, if you work and write for the New York Times,
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.840]   you will most likely have your book reviewed by them.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.360]   And if you write for the New York Times
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.900]   and sell enough copies in a week to make the list,
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.120]   you will most certainly be on their list.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.440]   Four, first-time authors seldom get on the list.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.400]   Five, finance is a harder genre to get on the list.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.640]   And then lastly, I'm not a preferred minority
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.320]   as an Asian-American the publication fights for.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.160]   It's just the way it is in America
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.480]   as the elites decide who gets an extra cookie
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.120]   or an extra helping hand.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.480]   I wanna be rewarded based on the quality of my work.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.440]   That's it, not based on my identity.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.200]   In fact, it is partially due to my self-belief
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.240]   and the quality of my work
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.280]   that I decided to go out on my own.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.320]   No longer could I ride on another institution's coattails.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.160]   So if you have the self-belief,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.020]   go out on your own and show the world what you got as well.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.200]   There is nothing more satisfying and gratifying
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   than creating something from nothing
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.840]   because of your efforts.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.880]   Just know this, nobody really cares how you got there,
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.140]   only that you made it.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:01.140]   So don't let honor and pride keep you on hard mode forever.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.420]   Figure out the system.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.080]   Maybe you've got the game, the system,
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.840]   so long as you don't do anything illegally to get ahead.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.640]   Because once you become part of the elite,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.300]   I think you get multiple second free passes.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.380]   You can screw up many, many times
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.120]   and you can just try again.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.760]   It's kind of almost like starting a business
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.680]   if you're rich.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.800]   If you're rich and you fail, you can just try again.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.200]   There's no devastation.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.920]   But if you're poor and you try to start a business,
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.680]   you might only have one shot, maybe two shots,
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.440]   but likely only one shot until it's back to the salt mines.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.640]   Yes, it's nice to feel special.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.520]   However, you will ruin your life
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.320]   if you go too far in pursuing prestige.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.360]   We all want some, we all need some
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.080]   for ourselves and our family.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.720]   But like everything, there's a balance.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.360]   Instead of doing something you like,
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.440]   you might end up doing something you hate
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.600]   because society deems it's worthy.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.880]   And when you look back on your life,
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.680]   you might end up feeling full of regret
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.920]   for not pursuing your dreams.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.080]   And all for what?
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.960]   So you can be part of an exclusive club
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.200]   that shuts most people out?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.120]   I say forget about it.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.680]   Instead, celebrate your middle class, average status.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   I think it's the best class in the world.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.000]   And if we really wanna be an elite,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.200]   be elite at giving away your time and money
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.680]   to help other people.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.960]   Because the more inclusive you are,
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.480]   the better you will also feel.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.720]   Financial Samurai will never have a paywall
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.240]   to listen to this podcast
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.280]   or read the articles on financialsamurai.com
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.320]   because I don't wanna shut out a poor kid
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.480]   or a poor family who wants to learn about personal finance.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.120]   I'm not gonna create some ridiculous $2,000 e-course.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.160]   That's just never gonna happen.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.920]   It's so unaffordable.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   I'd much rather try to get an institution I believe in
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.200]   that's synergistic in supporting my work.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.800]   So I say congratulations to all the elites out there
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.920]   for achieving great goals.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.160]   It's not easy getting to the top of your profession.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.280]   Don't let anybody discredit your hard work and talent.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.760]   However, if you have to go on strike to make ends meet,
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.600]   perhaps the definition of being an elite needs to change.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.320]   After all, what's the point of being so good at something
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.720]   if you can't even be properly compensated?
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.440]   If we are lucky enough to be at the top of our profession,
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.520]   the only thing I ask is for all of us
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.840]   to give others a chance to ascend as well.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.120]   Let's not pull the ladder up from behind us.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.080]   If we do, we might not have enough support to prevent us
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.640]   from when we eventually fall over.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.320]   Thanks so much everyone for listening.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.480]   If you enjoyed this episode,
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.080]   I'd love a positive five-star review.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.480]   If you wanna support my work,

[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.720]   I'll talk to everybody later.
