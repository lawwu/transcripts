[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Friday Q&A show today, live Friday Q&A.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   These are fun. I've been enjoying these and based upon the feedback from
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   y'all, the audience, y'all have been too. Basically it works like this. Got a conference
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   line and I got callers there and they gave me a brief
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   hint of what they want to talk about, but beyond that
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   you show up, you ask questions, and we talk.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host. Thank you for being with me. This is the show where we work on a rich
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   life now while building financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   We'll see what comes out. A lot of aspects to that.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   But today and tomorrow are both important.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I'm going to do my best to help these callers and vicariously help you
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   get there a little quicker and more efficiently.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I really enjoy doing these live Friday Q&A calls. They keep me on my toes
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and they're good training and good practice and get a little bit of feedback. If you would like to join
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   a call like this, feel free to become a patron of the show.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron. That's where you will find
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   all of the details about that. That'll gain you access to the scheduled time, to the
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   scheduled details and the scheduled information. You can call in
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and ask me whatever you want. So at the moment as we start our recording here, there are
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   two listeners on the line with questions and let me see who to
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   pick first. You know what? We'll go with Jason. So Jason, welcome to the Friday
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Q&A call. Go ahead and kick us off with a question.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Hey, thanks. Good to be here. I was curious if you could talk about the
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   differences in investing regarding compounding
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   interest, the famous average rate of return
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   that everybody always uses in their future value formulas, and a real rate of
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   return and what they are.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Okay. So I'll try to keep this simple, but
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   it's a valuable question and let me make up some
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   examples here. So this is a little sales
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   technique. I used to use this in talking about
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   life insurance and one of the real strengths
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   of whole life insurance, cash value life insurance,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   one of its real strengths is that it only goes up in
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   value. Now, the weakness is how fast does it go up
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   in value. The other weakness is it starts pretty small because all the expenses
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   come out first. But one of the strengths is that it only goes up
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   in value. It is guaranteed by an insurance company to only go up
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   in value. I think that is something that we often
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   don't appreciate enough and so I used to in making presentations to
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   potential clients regarding life insurance, I used to demonstrate it
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   with a little bit of math and this is the example I used to use. Pretend
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   that we have an investment that goes
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   up in value by 100% in the
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   first year. Then in the
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   second year, it goes up in value by 100%.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Then in the third year,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   it goes down in value by 50%. And you ask,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   what is the rate of return that you get with that investment?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Now, what people will often do is they will run what
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   we would do and I encourage if you haven't done this before, just hit pause and run
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   the math and just ask yourself. I won't stretch it out into
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   the dramatic sales presentation but it is a very useful question. So if you do
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   the math and you say, okay, well, it is 100, you would do 100
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   plus 100, that equals 200 and then it goes down 50
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   so you would subtract 50, that equals 150 and then you divide that by
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   3, you wind up with a 50% average rate of return.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And that is a really great rate of return.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But what people often don't do, that is the average rate of return. What people often
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   ignore, however, is what is the real rate of return. And so let's pretend that
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   instead of using averages, let's actually do the math of the way that I
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   presented it. So you have $100 in an investment account and
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   $100 goes up in value by 100%. So we do
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   $100 times, let's just do it times 2, that is the simplest
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   way to do it. So you wind up at the end of the first year, you have $200
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   in your account. Then in the second year, if it goes up in value
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   by 100%, then $200 times
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   2 doubles up and it is $400.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And then in the third year, however, if it goes down by 50%,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   then you wind up in a situation where
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   50% decrease is down to $200. Now I can't remember what
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   the numbers I used to use. I used to use an example that was very simple math for people
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   to do in their head. But what it actually would show that instead
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   of their money going up, it would actually go down in
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   value. And that would be the real rate of return.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So if you start to compare these, you recognize there is a
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   difference. Now, this is often used by people who are going to be
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   critical of rate of return calculations. And so usually how you
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   hear it is to say, "If an investment goes down in value by
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   40%, it doesn't just have to go up in value by 40%,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   it's got to go up in value by 80% or whatever the inverse is. It's got to go up in value
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   by 80% in order just to break even." And that's the criticism. And this
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   can be a substantial criticism of volatile investments.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Where to take it? I think it's mathematically valid. What it demonstrates
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and whatever the numbers were that I used to
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   use, I can't remember exactly, but it demonstrates the value of something
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   that just consistently and steadily goes up. That can be very valuable because
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   if you just had an average of 5% increases per year, that can be really, really strong.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   But it also demonstrates the value
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   of steady growth. But the
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   issue that I have personally with it is that just because an investment
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   goes down in value by 20% doesn't necessarily mean there
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   was any real reason for it to go down in value by 20%. And
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   you only lock in that loss if you sell. So if I own a house that
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   is worth $100,000 and it goes down in value by 20%,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I'm not all of a sudden realizing it's got to go up by 40%
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   in order, and I'm all freaked out about it. No, I'm just recognizing like I still have
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   the house. Yeah, it went down, but I'm not worried about it. And the next guy
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   that comes along and wants to buy the house, is he just going to focus on what the change
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   is from what the difference in the change is
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   of what the value where it went down? Or is he going to focus on something
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   else? Is he going to go on and look at what's the
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   value of the house for me to live in? If it were for comparing a stock, what's the current value
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   of the company, et cetera? So that's just a quick
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   overview of it. Do you want to ask a more
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   specific application of it, Jason? Or is that helpful just to see the difference?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I appreciate the help in
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   delineating the difference. I think the two things that I would follow
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   up is that any time you run any sort of
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   projection, whether it be a 401(k) or IRA or any sort of
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   investment that has a requirement for a future projection for you,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   whether it be early retirement or financial independence, the
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   calculations always assume an average rate of return or essentially a
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   compounding interest. So I'm curious to know
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   the compounding interest average rate of return, there's no -- there's an assumed
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   CVA basement of how far an investment
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   would reduce. It doesn't account for the losses. So I'm
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   wondering how accurate, if you will,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   a future value projection
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   using an average rate of return, compounding interest type of formula versus
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   a real rate of return, how accurate do you think those
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   CVAs are a really good way to accurately run future projections?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Well, it does wind up being a problem, which is why
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   this is most famous. And I'm not
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   skillful enough on this topic to present to you
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   a thought out, you know, one, two, three, here's the direct application. I would need to give
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   some thought to an outline of answering this question more specifically. So
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   this is just the quick answer, and it's an area where perhaps I can
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   address it in a future time with a prepared show outline where I'm ready to give you the
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   pros and cons. The average -- when you're comparing
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   averages versus real, the
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   mistake that -- you can
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   overstate something, which is why when you're working with a financial planner, the math
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   -- when I just use an average rate of return,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I wouldn't use that necessarily in a projection
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   when planning a retirement income scenario for a 55-year-old.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   That's why I developed things like Monte Carlo analysis.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So Monte Carlo analysis is a statistical tool that is
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   brought in to use the reality
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   of the fact that returns will vary widely. They'll vary in amount.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   You'll have positive returns, negative returns. They'll vary in
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   sequence. Sometimes you face a bear market in the beginning, and that
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   wrecks everything. Sometimes you face a bull market. And so
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   when you're planning something specific like, "Can I live on this money for the rest
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   of my life?" Personally, I'm going to be much more comfortable with using a Monte
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Carlo analysis or a simulation like that and modeling whatever portfolio
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I've constructed than I am just using the average rate of return.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   But it's still useful. I mean, just an average rate of return is still
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   a useful benchmark to demonstrate how the money can grow.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   If you get enough time, and if your time period
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   goes out far enough, then the average rate of
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   return is very meaningful. You can
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   track the dollars, and you can track them through with what's the performance of an actual dollar,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   but you can't do that on the air, that type of thing. So the average
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   rate of return is useful, but it's not as precise as
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   you'd like it. Let me give some thought. I will write this
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   topic down on my list of shows to do and maybe try to present some more
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   thought-out, prepared ideas and comments
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   that would be more helpful on the subject. Let's go ahead and switch
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   to Kevin. Kevin, you're up next. Go ahead and
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   ask a question or comment. Hey, Joshua. Thanks.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   My question deals with how do
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   you approach friends and family that are making
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   financial decisions that you're convinced are
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   not good for them to make because you yourself have been
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   in their very shoes? I guess this could apply to lots
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   of areas of life, not just financial. But I guess
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   how do you and your wife approach your friends and your family
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and help speak truth
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and love and good wisdom
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   into them, but not be overbearing, not be
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   that guy and totally turn them off to even
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   hearing the good you might have to say?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So... Big question. Sorry.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Yeah. No. So I'll give you the honest answer.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Very straightforward and it's very simple.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   We don't. I do not approach people and
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   give them unsolicited advice. And I used to.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   But as a... Well, is there an exception? I'm sure
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   there's an exception. I'm often bursting over with ideas that
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I want to tell people. Recently, I'm often just
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   bursting over because I see the things that other people often don't see.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   And so, real story. Recently, a friend of mine
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   came over for dinner. And this is a long-time family friend.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   We've been friendly. We know each other. We had a long relationship.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   We're not extremely close. But this friend had made some poor decisions
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and... This friend had made
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   some poor decisions and had worked hard over the last couple years of building
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   their life back together. But during
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   the context of the conversation, I hadn't seen him in a while, I invited him over and we
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   were talking. During the context of that conversation, they started to share with me some
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   unsolicited... Just some details of what they were doing, how they're getting their life put back together.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And they had
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   purchased a vehicle that I
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   were paying... And they had bad credit. They purchased a vehicle. It was an expensive
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   vehicle. Financed it with the
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   buy-here-pay-here financing and were paying a very high rate of
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   interest for the purpose of building their credit. And I just
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   look at that situation. I just think, "This is crazy. There's no reason for
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   this. I could show you a better way." But on that topic, I
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   kept my mouth shut. I didn't say anything about it. I mean, what is there to say?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And the problem is you can't say something to somebody because
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   it's a rare person who's ready and able and willing to
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   admit a mistake. And if you
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   demonstrate... It's kind of like an argument. I have a general rule that I will
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   almost never argue with people. I almost never
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   argue with friends. And the reason... Years ago, when I was a kid and I
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   read "How to Win Friends and Influence People," chapter one of that book...
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Maybe it was chapter one, chapter two. The first few principles is that
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   you can never win an argument because if you win an argument,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   you and I arguing subject matter A, and we win, you're going to
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   feel... And I win the point. You're going to feel belittled.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   You're going to feel humbled, and that's going to wreck our relationship and our friendship.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   If you win, I've lost the argument.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   So you can't win an argument. Now, I do think there is an exception. There are some
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   friends of mine who are thoughtful people that are
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   able to disconnect themselves from an opinion.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And those friends, I'll enjoy an argument back and
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   forth, and we'll argue the point, but we're not emotionally invested in it.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   The problem is when you get into money, it's the same dynamic. If I
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   tell somebody that they've made a mistake, they're not going to be open to that,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and that's going to force them to admit it. So they've got to learn it themselves. So
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   as a general rule, I don't give advice to people unless it's
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   solicited. Now, exceptions, yes. Sometimes I'll try,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   if I really sense that somebody is actually interested, I'll try to
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   allow them to ask a question.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And if there's a way I can... Or I'll ask
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   permission. Like, "Would you like some advice?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I've thought a lot about this. Would you like some ideas?" And I did that
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   with that friend. Not on the subject. I didn't actually talk to them about the car, but they were
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   saying they were planning to buy a house. And I said, "Would you like some ideas on how you could do that
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   in a really intelligent way?" And then I go ahead and do it from there.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   But I'm just convinced that unless somebody's asking me a question, they don't want an
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   answer. And so I've never seen it work well.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   The times that I break my rules, I almost always regret it. I almost
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   always wind up hurting somebody. And so I just... I have
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   this general idea that, in general, I should simply
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   live the way that I believe is best and allow people to
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   see that. And if they want my opinion on something,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   they'll seek me out. So as a general rule, I don't give advice.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I have people in my life who are very close to me
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   that I see them making many what I would consider to be financial mistakes.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I don't open my mouth. There are positions of
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   authority. For example, if you are working with
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   somebody in a counseling setting, as a
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   financial advisor, if somebody has solicited my services as a financial
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   advisor, now, as Carl Richards says, may have your
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   permission to be professionally candid. OK, that's useful.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   If I'm working with somebody and there's a level of accountability,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   whether that's an employment situation, that's that one.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   You have to be careful. I'm not going to be involved there as far as telling someone what to do
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   in an employment situation. But a good example, like in a church setting,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   where there's authority, in that situation there, I have a
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   responsibility at times to engage with people even if they don't want it because I'm
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   held accountable for that. But as a general rule,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   I don't give unsolicited advice.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Frustrating, huh?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   >>Yeah, I'm humbled by that answer.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   >>It does no good. If somebody's not asking a question,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   they have no interest in your answer. And then the other flip side of it,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   if somebody doesn't ask you a question, they don't care what you have to say.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And the other side is if somebody doesn't pay you for advice, they generally don't care what you have to say.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   They generally don't. I could give the same advice.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   This happened to me a couple weeks ago. I had an experience
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   with a guy and I pushed – well, it was a couple weeks ago.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   I was up in Tennessee. And while I was in Tennessee, I stayed at an Airbnb.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   And at this Airbnb, the person
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   shared with me – we were just kind of friendly, a little bit
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   of chatter. Relationship opened up and they
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   started talking about some career decisions that they were making. And I
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   listened for a while and asked some questions. And then I asked their permission
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   to say something. I said, "I know you don't know me, but would you be interested
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   in some ideas?" because they were frustrated. They were stuck in their career.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   They didn't have the opportunity to progress.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I said, "Would you be interested in a couple of ideas of how – that you
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   might be able to get where you're trying to go with a little bit of work and no money?"
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   because they were stuck. They didn't have any money. And they said, "Yeah, OK."
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   So on that basis, I asked the question first, asked permission. That gave me a little bit.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And I said, "I know you don't know much about me, but if I were in your shoes, here are the
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   things that I would consider. I would consider doing A, B, C, D, E."
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And I gave them a whole – basically, I mean I probably pushed beyond what I should have.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I gave them about a 20-minute discussion of how they could transition from what
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   they were doing to what they wanted to be doing in about two years with
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   no money out of pocket and achieve worldwide notoriety and fame.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And at the end of it, I could tell that I had pushed past that.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And who knows? Maybe they'll surprise me and not. But I sensed
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   at the end of the discussion, I sensed that I had broken
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   the relationship by pressing past what they had asked for.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   And that same content, I am building that into a course right now,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   something along the lines of how to become a noted
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   expert in your field in two years or less. I don't know what scammy
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   marketing title I'll come up with. But I'm building that same content
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   into a course right now. And I'll sell it for – I haven't
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   decided on the price yet, but I'll sell the same content packaged in a course.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And when I sell it and somebody buys it, they'll actually do it
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   and they'll be happy to do it. They'll buy it and because they're invested in the advice,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   they'll benefit from it. But the person I gave it to for free, there's
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   no perceived value to it. So when you combine those two things together,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I don't give advice. I come home and I talk to my wife and I say, "I don't want to be
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   critical of that person, but I just wish they would ask me a question. I see this, this, this, this."
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I tell her and then I let it go and I wait for them to ask a question.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   So is that helpful, Kevin?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Kevin Patrick: Yeah, that is. Yeah, I like your perspective of asking
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   them for permission first. I think that's helpful.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So –
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Paul Matzko: Yeah, I think there are some times – and I'll tell you the other exception to that.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I think number one, if I'm going to give advice that's unsolicited, I at least need to ask
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   for permission. And then number two, I do believe there are times
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   when you see somebody – there are some things
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   that I do with my children. There are some things that I give my child an option.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I try to give them a choice. Would you prefer to wear the blue jeans or would you prefer to wear the khaki shorts?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   If I'm OK with both options, it's nice to give
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   my child options. But if they're going to run into the street,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I'm not giving them an option. And so I do reserve in that answer, I do
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   believe we have at times a responsibility to give the difficult
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   answer even when it's not solicited. Because
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   we will give an account for people's –
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I will give an account for those who are in my life who are close to me. I'll give an account
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   for some of their souls. And so in that context, there are things that are
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   so serious that are matters of life and death, both
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   physical and spiritual, that at that point in time, I feel
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   a responsibility to press past. But I have – in the times
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   that that's occurred, I've had to be content with the fact that this may break the
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   relationship. And if it's so serious that I'm willing to break the relationship over it,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I think there's a time to do that. But I personally have never
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   found that to be the case with financial topics, only with topics that are more
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   important than financial topics. So let's go on. And
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Richard, you've joined the call. What would you like to talk about today?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Hey, Josh. Can you hear me? Yes. Go ahead. Great.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   My wife and I have been trying to decide on purchasing
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   both life insurance and long-term disability insurance for ourselves.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   The only question I have, though, is how to approach that
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   in conjunction with the fact that we have employer-paid plans ready and
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   policies ready for both life and long-term disability.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So it's pretty simple. Because they're in place already, you're not going to do anything with those plans.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Let's tackle life insurance first.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Have you calculated an appropriate amount of life insurance for you to have?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Yes. I think we have.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Tell me the number for you. How much life insurance do you need?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Based on the calculation I have, it's like 1.7.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Okay. So how much insurance do you have at your job?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   850. Okay. And are you
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   paying extra money for that?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Very, very little, if anything.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Okay. So if you're paying very little, I would calculate that and get some
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   assuming that, assume young
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   guy, young family, that type of situation.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Yeah. I'm 38. She's 32. We have a one-year-old.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And we'll be adding more. Cool. So you're going to be buying mainly term insurance.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   You're going to be buying a lot of term insurance. So what I would do in that situation is
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   if you need 1.7, I would buy a million and a half
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   of term life insurance outside of my job and I'd keep the 850
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   recognizing -- and these numbers are so fuzzy because we're talking
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   the difference of $3 to $4 or $5 a month. So I'm not going to worry about it
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   too much. I'm going to go with how much they'll approve.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   The insurance company will take your income. At the age of 38, they'll give you
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   somewhere probably around 20 times your annual earnings of total life
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   insurance and they'll subtract off of it
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   your work insurance. So they might give you a million or a million and a half.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Somewhere in that range, if it's a million, if you need
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   a million seven based upon the calculations, then I'll get at least a million
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   outside of my job. If they'll give me a million and a half, I'll consider doing
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   that and I'll calculate the amount of the insurance at
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   my job, see what I'm actually paying. I'm being a
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   little bit cavalier with the numbers simply because -- and it'll frustrate
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   the engineers in the audience -- but the difference between having a million and a half
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   or $2 million of coverage, for most people who are young and who are
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   healthy, in term life insurance is relatively insignificant.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   As long as you've got at least a million outside of your job,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   if I were your life insurance agent, I would be resting comfortably
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   that if you got fired and you lost your insurance and in the meantime you'd gotten sick, at least
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   you got a million dollars. I can get your family through on a million dollars. It's not quite as luxurious
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   as the million seven, but I can get you through on a million.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   To be honest, Josh, the interesting thing is I went
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   through a formula that I found and it's the one that came up with that number. It's a number that
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   seems ridiculously high to me, sitting here, to be honest.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   It's just your point. It's not so cavalier after all.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I feel like I'm right there. Let me tell you how to affect that. How much
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   do you and your family spend every month or every year?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It's about $10,000 a month.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Okay. So you spend about $10,000 a month.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And you say that a million seven sounds a little bit
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   high to you, right? Correct.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Okay. So if I came to you with a check today
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and I forced you and I said, "You've got 30 seconds
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   to make the option. Here is a check. You know it's good. Certified check.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Whatever." For $1.7 million and today
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   you're going to stop working and you're never going to work again for the rest of your life.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Here's $1.7 million. Would you
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   feel comfortable instantly pulling the plug on your job
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   and planning for your family's future based upon
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   a check for $1.7 million? Would you instantly jump at that option?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I could never work again, you're saying? Never work again.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   No.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I don't think I would. I think I would pass.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Right. And I would pass too. And the reason I do that is because often
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   people get – I've used the same example with clients.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   And the reason is we're not used to thinking in terms
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   of $1.7 million. We're used to thinking in terms of $10,000
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   a month. But $1.7 million, if
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I – at 38 years old, in the situation that you are
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   in, $1.7 million would run out on you.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Now, let's say that you died. Assume
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   for a moment – I don't know what your wife's income is, etc. But what I encourage people to do
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   is – again, term life insurance is cheap.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'll run a number here in a minute just to tell you. But what I encourage people to do
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   is to say, "Pretend that you're
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   going to plan for the fact that your spouse is never going to work again." Because if I
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   die and leave my wife with two young kids, I don't
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   want her to be thinking about, "OK. I've got five years to stay at home and then I've got to go out and figure out a job.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And what am I suited for? And what – I want her to know she's going to be set,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   that she's going to be fine. She's going to be OK." And so I
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   want to make sure that she's got that confidence. So if she wants to go
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   back to work or if she wants to marry another man and she's not doing
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   it because of financial pressure – and when I run the calculation of,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   "Oh, it costs me an extra $7 a month to have
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   an extra few hundred thousand dollars of insurance, an extra half a million probably,"
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   it brings me a lot of pleasure to know that I've squared this thing away
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   really, really well. So if you wouldn't instantly jump at $1.7 million,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   then why do you think your wife would feel so comfortable
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   maintaining your lifestyle? Now, the rebuttal that you should immediately make is,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   "But I'm gone." Yes, and there should be lower expenses. Yes. OK. So we'll get rid
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   of one car and maybe instead of living on 10, your family is going to live on 8 or
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   7,500 or whatever. I don't want to get too bogged down with the numbers.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Your family is not going to go – she's not going to go from 10,000 to 3,000 a month.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   So if you had told me you're spending $3,000 a month and
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   that was what your family was spending, then yeah, $1.7 million would be
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   fine. But if you're spending 10,000 a month,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   $1.7 million is going to be just about right.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So I'm a little cavalier with the numbers
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   simply because it's so cheap, man. And I'm telling you, do you have –
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   other than the insurance that you have with your job, do you have any other life
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   insurance or have you previously owned other life insurance?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   No, I have not. Only since we've had our daughter and we started having those
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   conversations. What is your –
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   what month and year were you born?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   December 1977. Okay. So I just pulled up
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   a life insurance quoting thing here and let's just see what $1.7
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   million of term life insurance is going to cost here. Let's run
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   10, 20-year term.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I don't have the ability to run annual renewable term. You should consider it 38. You should still
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   consider having some annual renewable term and
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   let's run this at the best non-tobacco rates.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   We'll prove the point. Let's move on to disability. So we're talking for $1.7 million bucks
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   of 10-year term life insurance, we're talking $443 a year.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   That's MetLife Mutual of Omaha, $487.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   For 20-year term, we're talking $885 a year.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   So if I were in your shoes, you're at the age – you're at the age and you should
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   sit down with your insurance agent and look at some different numbers. But we're
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   talking when you spend $10,000 a month, we're talking about
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   for $1.7 million, $440 a year
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   of cost. So it fits into your budget really nicely. But
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   the piece – and that's why I asked if you had it before.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   To be clear, this sounds like an insurance – a life insurance sales technique.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   It probably is. But I don't –
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   I no longer have life insurance. If this helps new listeners, I no longer
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   have a license. I don't sell life insurance. I have no commission-related
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   ideas in it. I just know that once
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   you have life insurance, if I ask you to give it up,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   most people – not all, there are exceptions – most people don't want to give it up.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I have $2.5 million of coverage.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   As soon as I can rebuild my income to the point where I can get more,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I'll consider getting more just because I don't like the idea of
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   it going away. And I don't like the idea of it going down.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Let's move on to the disability insurance. I want to answer that question.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   With disability insurance, you already have coverage at work. The first thing
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   you need to do – and I'm going to short-circuit this and just tell you what you need to do rather than going back
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   and forth so we can handle some other questions. But the first thing you need to do is find
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   out exactly what you have. So the key questions
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   you want to ask yourself is how much insurance do you have?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Number two, you need to ask yourself what is it based on? The biggest
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   mistake that I have seen is people say, "Okay, I've got 60% of my income,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   but when we ask the question, we ask the HR person
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   to read the policy," you find out that it's based upon your base income.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And you have a $5,000 a month base salary, but you actually make $7,000
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   a month of commissions. And your long-term disability doesn't cover that.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   So that's the situation some people are in. Some people not. You just need to ask the question,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   what is it based on? How long is it in force?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Sometimes you'll have a really short, really bad disability
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   policy. Sometimes you'll have a really long, really great one, but it only gives you coverage for
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   two years or five years, something like that, instead of to age 65 or to age 70.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   How long is it in force? And then if I get the benefit, what's the benefit and is
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   the benefit indexed for inflation, etc.?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Whatever insurance, even with all those questions, those will help you to know what you have.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   But then you still need to figure out, what can I get? The reality is
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   whatever you have at your job, you're going to keep on having. And so what
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   the insurance agent will do is they will calculate for you what's
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   available. And that'll be based upon your job. It'll be based upon
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   the definition of disability that you choose. It'll be based upon that, and they'll tell you what's
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   available for you. And you'll go from there. Have you already
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   spoken with an insurance agent about what's available for you, or are you just at the beginning
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   stages? We have. So we've been working with
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   policygenius.com. I don't know if that
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   counts. But yeah, we've been working with them and talking with those guys. And do they make some recommendations
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   to you? They certainly have.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Yeah, they certainly have. So for example, you're right, 60%
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   is what I get through my employer. They pretty much give me the same advice you just did, finding out exactly
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   what I have. And then also because of the limits on what
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   insurance companies are willing to provide you with, they can get a supplemental policy on top of that
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   of some sort, perhaps.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Here's my rule. I realize
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   that the way that it comes across might sound a little bit cavalier. But
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   if you're not yet financially independent, I think you should have as much disability insurance
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   as you can get.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And the reason I say it so confidently is the insurance company
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   will not give you too much. They won't give you more than you make, for example.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Everything is calculated based upon your income and they won't give you more than you
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   can make. There are some jobs at which you've got to – I mean,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   if you're in a very manual labor job, sometimes you're just
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   forced by the reality of the premium to adjust
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   it back, to pull the benefit back. I mean, I've worked with people
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   who are in the trades and you start saying, "Hey, you're 55 years old
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and you're going to spend $380 a month on premiums. It's not
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   worth it. You've got to adjust it significantly." But for someone like you
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   who's 38 years old, young family, my advice is get as much
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   as you can get because the risk/reward
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   scenario, the way I look at it is simple. If you
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   can't save that $100 a month into
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   your retirement plan or into your kid's college plan, et cetera, there are
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   always options. You can work another year.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   You can have your kid work while they're in college or whatever
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   goals you have set for yourself. But if you get disabled, all of a sudden, all
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   those options go away and worse, you've got to face next month's bills.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   So when I compare them very simply, I'm generally
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   in the early years until you've built up income and built up
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   savings and are financially independent. Insurance is the
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   best bang for the buck because it guarantees the
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   stuff that you can't afford to lose. I would rather have first
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   before any other kind of insurance, I'd rather have disability income insurance.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   I'd rather have it before health insurance. I'd rather have it before life insurance.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I'd rather have it before car and liability and homeowner's insurance.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   All those things are required and they're all nice, but first, I'd have disability income insurance
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   because disability income insurance is what funds everything
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   else. If I get sick and get cancer and have a million dollar hospital
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   bill, all right, I've got to deal with it. And I can figure
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   out a way to deal with it. I'll work out a deal with my creditors. I may have to declare bankruptcy.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I don't know. I'll figure out a way to deal with that.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   But while I'm dealing with the million dollar bills, I'm also dealing
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   with the fact that I can't pay my landlord
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   rent. It becomes a lot more difficult to deal with the million dollars if I don't have
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   $3,000 or $5,000 a month coming in while I'm disabled.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   So get your disability insurance squared away first,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   then life insurance, then you add on your health insurance,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   then you add on your car insurance and homeowner's insurance. And the order doesn't hold
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   up because some of those are required and you already have some of those. But in order of priority,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   that is the most important thing.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   There's a show, and I've had the outline for a while, but I have
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   a listener. And this listener is a young man. He's 26 years old. And I'm
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   not saying it because it's a scare story. It's going to sound like that. I'm saying it because
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   it's a real story. This is a listener of my show. And he's been very involved with the community.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   We've corresponded. He's working hard on financial independence.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   He has a lot of financial acumen. I got an email eight months ago,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   10 months ago, something like that. And he said, "Joshua, I got bad news. I've got
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   cancer." And he said, "And I didn't do what you said.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I didn't go and get disability insurance. And am I going to be okay?" Now, we've had
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   some correspondence and we went back and forth. He's doing better. He's in remission. I'm on his
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   email newsletter, which is great. And so he's doing better.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   And I've been praying for him, and he's going to be okay. He's got family. He has assets. He's going to
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   be okay. But the point was, is I've watched him work that way through
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   and I've got the show outline. I've got the artwork. It's all done. I just haven't done it. What's it like to
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   actually be, you know, how does a -- the show is titled, "How Does a
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Diagnosis of Cancer Affect Your Financial Plan?" But if you can -- it makes a
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   big difference when you're going through chemo and doing all that stuff. If you can sit down
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   and you know that you've got $3,500 or $4,000 a month that's going to hit your
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   checking account on the first of the month every month, that helps a lot for you to focus on
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   getting well. And that, as a husband and a father, that helps a lot for you to
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   feel confident about fulfilling your responsibility towards your family.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   There's no stress that's not made worse by financial stress.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   So I hope that -- I know it's a little bit salesy, but that's the reality of it.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   People hear the insurance agent say it and they're like, "Ah, it's an insurance
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   agent. This one's selling me insurance." The reason insurance agents are usually so
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   insistent about it is because we've seen it. We've worked with clients who've
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   died. We've worked with clients who were disabled. And
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   when I was a life insurance agent and selling disability insurance as well,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   it was very difficult for me because I don't like to press -- I'm not a salesy
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   guy. I don't like to press on people. But I
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   had a professional obligation to where when I got the call,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   I had to make sure that I wasn't wondering if I'd done
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   everything I could. And one of my regrets
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   was that in six years of being an insurance agent, one of my regrets
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   was that I never had
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   a death claim, nor did I have a disability claim. And the
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   regret sounds funny, but I'm glad that none of
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   my clients ever died or became disabled. But
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   I would talk to all these old-time insurance agents and they would say,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "Once you have that first claim, it changes everything."
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And I'd talk with these guys who were in their 50s and their 60s and they talked about, "I've got
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   18 clients on disability claims right now," or, "I've had 24 death
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   claims," et cetera. And I had the privilege of being involved with
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   paying some death claims for what are called orphan clients, people that their agent
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   had left or whatever. And I'd been involved with helping them in that process.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And so I got to taste a little bit of it. But the worst I had was I had a client
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   who had bought insurance policies for their kids from me
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   twice. And they hadn't been able to keep them in force.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   But the first time they bought insurance for – they were in a very seasonal business, actually
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   the construction business. They worked with me at first when
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   times were good. They bought life insurance for mom, for dad. They bought life insurance
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   for the two kids. They bought
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   primarily life insurance, I think disability insurance for dad. Business fell apart.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   They had to dump all the policies. A couple years later, called me back,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   said, "Hey, we want to go ahead and get those policies put in force again." Awesome.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I got it in force again, life insurance for dad and mom.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And we did two little small life insurance policies for the kids. And then business got bad
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   again. And they had to drop the policies. And the second time
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   – it's not guilt, but the question I asked myself
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   was there's always a balance between how hard do I work to get my clients to keep their policies
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   because they're going to need them versus they need the money and I should just
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   let them go. And it's not about me keeping my commissions. The problem was
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   a while later, the timing is unclear in my mind, I found out that one of the kids
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   had been murdered. And it was the worst thing
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   ever because seeing them go through the grief of that
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   process and not having that policy in place for the kid and knowing
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   the situation – it always haunted me. I was like,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   "Did I do everything that I could?" So that's why insurance agents
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   are so pushy. That's why insurance agents are so
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   committed because when you've gone through that, the
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   potential guilt of saying, "If I just made a call, if I just helped them save
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   money somewhere, they could have kept this in force." And even though it was only, I don't know, $25,000,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   that $25,000 right now would make all the difference in the
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   world. That stuff builds on you and it causes you as an insurance agent to be
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   pretty emotionally committed. So
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   a bit of a spiel there. Hopefully it's useful. All right. Let's
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   go on. And a couple more people have called. Carl, did you
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   call in with a question today?
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Something you may have – I'm sure you've addressed on your podcast.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   There was a short list of documents that one should have in order
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   kind of the whole theme of the show today, how to call in in terms of
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   a will and I'm sure
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   there's other terminology like right to resuscitate or not. And I see there's
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   four or five of them. Can you go over those, highlight those? Yeah, the big four of these.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   You want to have a will. And the will says what happens to your stuff
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   when you die and it also says who do you appoint as the
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   guardian for your kids. That's all that a will says.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   So that's a will. In fact,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   wills are important. I do not believe they're the most important.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I differ with other people and they say everyone has got to have a will. No, everybody does
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   not have to have a will. If you don't own property and you don't have kids,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   you don't need a will. And if you don't own property that's going
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   to pass through the probate
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   court. So for example, if I'm working with somebody who's 20 years
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   old and they have a checking account and they have
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   a 401(k) and they don't have any kids
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   and they're not married and they're just going to leave everything to their parents,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   they don't need a will. They're going to die in test state and what happens
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   is the 401(k) will go to the beneficiary listed on the 401(k), the checking account
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   and their car will go to their parents or whatever their state's
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   intestacy laws say and they don't have kids. So they don't necessarily
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   have to have a will. But when you have kids or when you own property, you need a will.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   The second document is a living will and a living will
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   is essentially what – it's all the end of life stuff. It says,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   "Do I want to be kept on the – what's the thing called? The ventilator. Do I want to be kept
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   on life support? Do I want – what do I want at the end of my life?" That's the
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   living will. The third document
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   is a power of attorney and so there are two types
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   of powers of attorneys, documents three and four. Third is power of attorney for financial matters.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   You're incapacitated. You're in the hospital.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Who has control over your affairs? This is very important for people who have affairs,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   who have significant financial dealings.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   If somebody has a business and they're trying to pay the employees and they're in the
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   hospital and they can't authorize payroll, they need to have a power of attorney
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   in place or they need to have a system in place. It could be a springing
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   power of attorney that on their incapacity, this person is authorized to do this,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   to sign the checks, to get the money out, to keep things going while they're recovering. So you need a power
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   of attorney and then the healthcare – then the other form is a healthcare
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   proxy, healthcare surrogate or healthcare power of attorney depending on how
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   it's known in the local lingo. That's just simply authorizing somebody
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   to make medical decisions on your behalf. So those are the four basic documents.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   You can add to that trusts if you have them.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Go ahead and establish them, but that's kind of separate. Those aren't the four basic documents.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Okay, great. One follow-up question to that,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   how good or bad are the standard
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   documents one might find on like a Nolo? I think that's one of the places that
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   produce this versus one customized to your situation. My thought
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   is – I'm guessing that one that is customized is better, but
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   in absence of anything as a placeholder, how bad are those
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Nolo type documents? So it would depend
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   on probably two things, the complexity
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   of one's affairs and the desire of control
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   that you desire to exercise over the affairs
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   when you're gone. And so recognizing that a will does two important things.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   It establishes the guardianship of your child and it takes care of your
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   financial affairs. We can kind of separate these things. So
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   if a couple doesn't have a
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   will and if all they do is write up a piece of
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   paper that says we leave all of the money to
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   – I, Joshua Sheets, hereby being of sound mind because we've heard that in the movies – leave all of the
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   money to my wife if I die or
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   to my kids if we pre-decease it. And I assign Joe Smith
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   to be the guardian for my child and I also assign
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Joe Smith to take over my financial affairs and to manage the money
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   for the benefit of my kids. The fact that Joe Smith has been
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   acknowledged in that document as the guardian of the kids,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   that is better than if Joe Smith is not acknowledged because it gives
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   the probate judge, the court, the direction of what you're thinking.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Now, can these things be contested? Can the judge change that and strip that person's
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   rights because a family member – yes. That's all dealing
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   with the court. But the fact that you've acknowledged that Joe Smith is who you want to be the guardian, that's important.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   From the perspective of financial affairs,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   financial affairs are also going to be judged similarly. If you've given an indication
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   of what you want to happen to your financial affairs,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   then that's going to be sufficient.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   The way that fancier documents are valuable
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   is that fancier documents are going to allow you
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   to exercise more control over the money
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   based upon what you believe is
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   in the best interest of your family members. So if I were to leave –
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   let's say that my wife and I are out on date night and we die. We're dead.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   So we leave behind money. It would be a lot of money,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   especially because there would be insurance proceeds, and I leave all of that money to my kids.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Well, quite obviously, my two-and-a-half-year-old and seven-month-old children
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   are not competent to manage that money. And so
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   then the court is going to say, "Who is the person that Joshua assigned
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   to manage the money?" I should have that stuff set up in a trusteeship, which
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   I do. But I should have it set up with a trustee for the money
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   to manage it for the benefit of the kids. But what's going to happen is that once the kids
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   become adults, on their age of majority,
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   they're immediately going to have access to all of the money.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Well, if my kids inherit a couple million bucks or more
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   at their 18th birthday, depending on their character, that could destroy
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   them. And so what it might be wise for me to do is
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   if I know that there's going to be some additional benefit there for them,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   it might be wise for me to put more safeguards in place. It might be wise for
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   me to go ahead and put in place
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   some things that are going to stretch it out. They're going to receive a certain
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   amount for their health and maintenance and support.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   They're going to receive a certain amount at 18 for expenses. They're going to receive
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   the balance of it at 30. So it's all about the control. The other type of control
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   would be for a spouse. So let's say that whether it's because
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   somebody is concerned about their spouse and their spouse's character or whether
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   it's just out of a protection for their spouse. If you, as an example, just leave
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   all of the money to your spouse if you die and then
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   one, your spouse might spend it. If you know that you have a spouse who's a
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   spendthrift and you need to protect them, it might be wiser to put some
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   things in place so that they receive a stream of income that they can't outspend as
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   compared to receiving a lump sum. Or if you're trying to protect your spouse
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   from, say, a future predatory relationship, you leave $10 million
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   to your spouse and all of a sudden now she falls in love
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   with another man and now she's in a situation that man leaves her,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   divorces her, and now she's left with the money that
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   you left for her exposed potentially to
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   the other man. That's the type of situation that with good planning
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   you can avoid through the use of designating a trust that's going
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   to exist with certain agreements. So the whole point of having a more complicated
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   will is to establish more control
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   or also to do better planning. You recognize you've got some
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   tax liability, whether that's accrued income taxes and you're going to do some
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   intelligent tax planning or you've got some estate tax liability, etc.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   So you want to make sure that your documents are going to carefully transfer
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   things in the most advantageous way possible.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   -Okay. Good. Thank you. That answers my questions.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   You're welcome. Let's see. So I think that rounded out the first
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   questions. I'll take maybe just one or two more.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Let's go back to Jason. Jason, would you like to ask another question?
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   -Sure, I can. Just to
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   continue in the traditional way of Q&A, see if we can get you in trouble here.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   You mentioned before that you are
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   not heavily invested in the market much anymore and that you
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   had some objections to the companies or
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   markets for the fund that you were invested
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   in. I was wondering if you wanted to elaborate on that
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   any more and give us some more information
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   or insight as to what objections you were speaking of.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   -Um...
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   -How brave are you, my brother? -So the short answer is no, I don't particularly
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   want to, but I will briefly –
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   I will briefly. And just to give an example,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   and I don't – these things are not perfectly –
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   I can't give a perfect intellectual defense of all of these things, so I'll just –
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   if we were sitting down having a cold drink, I'll tell you what I would –
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   the answer I would give. First, I do not put my
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   personal conviction in this area on anybody else.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   I do not say to anybody else what they should do.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   This is purely my own personal conviction.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   And I leave any listener completely free,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   especially in this area, because I
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   have not – and the reason I say that was so important in this area is that I have
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   not – I sold
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   stocks. I sold mutual funds. I've owned mutual funds since I was 18 up
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   until, I don't know, a year or two ago, whenever I sold.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   And I've had a pretty
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   clear system of
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   morality for many years, and I – my conscience did
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   not bother me in the past. And so I just have to acknowledge
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   that this is me.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   But the older I've grown,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   I grew up with this – I would say mainstream, very
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   romantic ideal of
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   the US system of government and the US system of capitalism.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   I was always a capitalist. I always liked business.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   I've always – I still feel that Walmart has done more good
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   for people than many mainstream charities simply because
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   they've made people's lives better by having low prices,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   better stuff, low prices. And so I
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   had these ideas that
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   the world we lived in was somehow just. Growing up in the United States
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   of America, it's very easy to gain that perspective. I had
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   the idea taught to me in history that
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   we only fight just wars. The United States of America, they're – we're involved
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   in wars that have a moral cause. We're going to
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   eliminate Hitler or we're going to fight for freedom instead of
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   communism. And so I had these fairly mainstream
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   perspectives. But what happened is that systematically over the last decade or so,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   I started to actually do my own homework and I realized that most of
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   what I was taught in a mainstream
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   educational approach was more myth than reality.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   And there were a number of things. So I've come to the conclusion
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   that our global economy, specifically the US economy,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   is an economy that's built on war. I could never figure out why on
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   earth does – why on earth have we been at war for decades? And it seems like
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   it's one after another and after another. And the most difficult one for me
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   was in 2000 – or was it 2003
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   when the US invaded Iraq? And I
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   was this – at the time, I would have called myself a
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Republican. And I was a very idealistic
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   18-ish year old thinking like, "Yeah, this is right. We
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   got to get those terrorists." And when I was
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   in college, the second time of George Bush's re-election, I thought it'd be
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   fun to get involved with the – so I volunteered with the local Republican
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   group and I went and knocked on doors and said, "Yeah, we're going to get George Bush
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   elected." I remember how happy I was when he was elected. And then the Iraq war, I remember being
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   so in favor of the Iraq war. And at the time, I
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   didn't – I wasn't open to other perspectives. And
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   so I kept trying to justify things as
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   things went by and it just came out, "Oh, WMDs, but
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   wait a second, they're not there." And then, "Wait a second, why are we doing that?
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Why are we not doing that?" And it was a very painful experience, but I ultimately came to the conclusion
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   that I was bamboozled and I was completely wrong. And I said, "How could I
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   be so wrong?" And so I started digging into war. I started digging into
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   how was the global economy built and I've come to the conclusion that, again,
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   there's a book written 50-plus years
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   ago by a general and it's called War is a Racket. And his whole point at that time was that
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   war is a total, total racket. And I started reading some
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   of Anthony Sutton's books where he goes through and he traces all of the things that I was
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   so sure of that – he traces the Soviet Union. He talks about – and
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   he traced specifically the specific
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   parts and the specific amount of the Soviet Union
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   military infrastructure that was provided by the United States. And then I started digging through
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   the history and started to study a little bit of the history of
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   whether it was al-Qaeda or whether it was – we created al-Qaeda and then all of a sudden
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   we're fighting them and, "Wait a second, where did ISIS come from?" And you start tracing this through and, "What happened
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   in Iraq?" And it's such a muddled
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   mess. But yet as I dug into it, I started to find in so many
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   circumstances that it was just all based upon generating income
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   for the people who control the large corporations. And so then I dug in. I said,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   "Well, how much of our military budget – how much of our money do we spend on military?"
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   And you find that our economy is fueled based upon this global
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   war infrastructure. And that was
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   tough. That's tough. It was tough for me to admit. So
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   personally, I don't feel all that good about having money put in my pocket
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   that is based upon the output from a global war
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   infrastructure. That's not what I want to make my money from.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   I'm OK with defense. I'm OK with
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   individuals having the right to arm and defend themselves. I'm not OK with on a
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   global basis – I'm not OK with that.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   So then I – so that was just
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   one simple example. The reason I say with that is most people get into
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   – OK, we're going to – that's why investing in socially conscious
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   funds doesn't work for me. People say, "Oh, we're going to avoid
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   tobacco companies," or "We're going to avoid companies that don't – that
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   have unfair hiring practices in China." OK, cool.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   That's fine. But what about avoiding
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Lockheed Martin profits? I don't want to be involved in that.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   So there are other aspects as well. When I was with
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   a large insurance company, I just looked at how
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   capitalism works, and we all – we throw this term of crony
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   capitalism out there. But it's always somebody else's company.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   As long as it's ours – as long as it's not – it's always somebody else that's
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   causing the problems. And so you start to see, and it's across the board, is that every one of these
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   major corporations, it's just we buy influence, and nobody in
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   Washington is honest. Every company is just a matter of buying influence
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   as quickly as they can. And
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   step by step by step by step, it's just a matter of who can buy the most influence.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   And it's so frustrating to me that you've got full-time lobbyists working for a company.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Where was the "Mr. Smith goes to Washington" idea that I was taught? It's
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   complete baloney. So we live in this economy that's built upon whoever has
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   the most money buying the most influence, and now it's
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   absurd. Even the current presidential race, you've got – the people who are
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   involved in it are just so utterly corrupt.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   It's laughable. Half of them have been bought off by –
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   I mean – and I don't care whether it's Republicans or Democrats.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I read – I strongly recommend – if anyone's interested, the best book
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   – one of the best books I read last year was a book called Clinton Cash by Peter Schweitzer.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   And if you want to know how the Clintons got rich, it's amazing. And I wasn't around – I was
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   a kid during the Clintons, so I was never around for all the old scandals. I just read this one and said, "How did
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   this family go from so-called being broke when they leave office to being
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   mega rich?" And you start to read it and you start to understand.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Ah, OK, I see. And the author of that book is very
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   careful. They only – he and his team, they only state precisely
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   what they can prove. And same on this other side.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   Donald Trump, the man boasts about buying off politicians, but yet somehow he's supposed
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   to be – it's just disgusting. So it's
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   endemic. And then when you get to – so I have major
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   issues with many large corporations that the fact is you just buy off whatever
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   government officials and you can't bribe people in other countries, but you can bribe everyone in your own
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   country. And then when you get to deeply held moral
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   issues, I have a major problem
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   with – I would be OK. I do not mind if – I don't think that companies
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   need to make moral stands. It's up for people to make moral
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   stands. I don't particularly believe that it's a – it's not
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   a company's job to say this is right or this is wrong. It's the people
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   that should be held accountable. And there should be – they should be held completely
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   accountable for their actions as individuals. So I'm not
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   saying that every company out there has to say we somehow promote these positive things.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   But what is so frustrating to me is
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   when I look at the majority of the –
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   when I look at the majority of large corporations,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   they function based upon what's popular
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   and they take their stands based upon what's popular instead of what's based
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   upon what's right. And a major eye-opening thing for
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   me was when I studied the history of – when
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   I dug into the history, the legal history and the history of the press
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   and the promotion of homosexuality in our culture, I had never
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   done any of that research. I just assumed things are kind of trundling
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   along a little bit. I started to research it. I started to find it. And all of a sudden it was like,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   wow, I've seen this. I see this. And then I watch all the companies
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   that get involved and line up one by one. And it's basically – if you watch
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   what happened last summer with the – after the Obergefell
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   decision, when every single company is going to –
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   when every single company is saying, OK, we're going to change our corporate logo
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   and the White House is going to have rainbow colors on it and every single
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   company is going to use this as their promotion – we're going to promote
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   homosexuality and the acceptance of homosexual behavior.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   That is – that's very
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   difficult for me to deal with. Now, the challenge where these arguments
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   usually get misheard is people often assume that
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   I don't want to use companies to try to control other people's lives.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   And that's where people – this debate often goes. People say, well, you're just trying to tell other people what to do.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   No, but I don't want – I'm not going to do business with
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   a company that's openly, publicly advocating
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   for sin. That – I'm not going to do it and I'm
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   not going to profit from it. I'm not going to be involved in it. I'm not going to make purchasing decisions.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Now, how that should be regulated in a free society, hey,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   you know what? I'm pretty much a live and let live guy.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   I'm pretty much going to leave people alone. I'm not going to – I'm not going to advocate
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   for new laws and whatnot. But what happens is that people like
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   me have been – I think have pretty much been put on our heels
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   more and more where it's like I'd love to just live and let live but
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   now we're going to – it's not a matter of live and let live. And so at this point, it's gone so
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   far. So I reached a point in time and I just said like my conscience
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   would no longer permit me to do it. So
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   I just – it's
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   across the board. It's not just one issue. I've just come to the – I've come to the
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   conclusion that the majority of the way that corporate America acts is to
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   completely corrupt. It's filled with lies and
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   – it's filled with lies and there's nobody – you get
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   into this group think and I don't see any leaders standing there and
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   saying we're willing to stand for it on a mass basis. Now, I think there
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   are individuals. That's why when I sold all my mutual funds,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   I didn't do it because I wasn't willing to own stocks. I just simply did it based upon
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   the fact that I am not willing for somebody else to make those decisions.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   What was the story in the Wall Street Journal that came out about the number of
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   people that were – the companies and their performance that had the highest
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   percentage of email addresses registered with Ashley Madison?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   It's the type of thing that – I guess it's
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   instructive. It's instructive. The way that
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   we act in one area of our life. An adulterer
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   who breaks the bonds of their marriage
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   is going to be the same type of
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   person unless that person is reformed. It's the same type of person
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   who's going to cheat on their taxes. It's the same type of person who's going to pledge their hand in a contract
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   and follow through. I guess I've come to the point where I'm disgusted with the whole thing
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   and I don't want to profit from it.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   It's a little bit easier in that I have plenty of other ways that I can invest the money, but I just
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   got to the point where I cannot take it anymore and I do not want
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   to earn the money from it. Now, what should be done on a social basis or anything?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   I don't have a clue. I mean I have ideas, but nothing I desire to talk about
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   publicly. But that was the story. That's what happened, Jason.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   Thank you. I appreciate it.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   I have no idea how to handle these things. All I know is that we're called to be stewards
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   of the money that we have.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   We're called to be stewards of the money that we have and
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   money plays a role.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Money in and of itself is an amoral
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   item. There's nothing inherently moral or immoral about
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   money, but I am not going to commit
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   the funds that I've been entrusted to
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   into things that I believe are evil.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   I'm not going to do it. Now, what are the good things to do with it?
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   That's the challenge, but I'm not going to commit the things
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   that I'm entrusted to to evil. So thank you all for listening to today's show.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   Man, we're getting some heavy questions. So
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   hopefully they're at least thought-provoking. And thank you all for calling in
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   and for listening to today's show. If you'd like to join and participate in a show

[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   value in some of the ideas that I'm
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   sharing with you. The time that we have is the most precious resource that
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   any of us have. It's one of the most precious resources that any of us have.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   And as we're stewards of our time, we need to invest it
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   into things that
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   matter. And so I hope and I trust
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   that some of these ideas and some of this content has been useful to you.
