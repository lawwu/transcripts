[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.680]   and today on the show, I want to dig into one of those extremely esoteric personal finance topics
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.280]   that interests me enormously, and I hope that you also will find it interesting.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   What topic is that, you say? It's the topic of how to grow tall, or put more accurately as to
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.760]   most of what I'm going to discuss, how to help your children to grow tall. What does this have
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.680]   to do with personal finance, you ask? Well, we've been aware for quite a while that there's pretty
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.600]   good documentation that indicates that tall people, most especially tall men, tend to earn
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.720]   more money over their careers. This has been documented in various countries and in various
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.680]   sectors. How much? Well, I've seen evidence that claims that it's either a little bit below or a
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.080]   little bit above about 2% of an increase in earnings for each inch of height. If a man is
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.520]   an inch taller, you can increase his earnings by something like around 2%. That's pretty significant.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.840]   It adds up over time. I would say also that that's not the only thing. I think that generally,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.280]   tall men have an easier time gaining leadership positions, gaining promotions. This is often
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.440]   talked about as the height premium. Taller individuals are more likely to be CEOs of
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.080]   companies and hold other high-level positions. There's a positive correlation between
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.200]   tall individuals and prestigious occupations, high-status occupations.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.520]   In addition, being tall can positively influence a lot of social perceptions and relationships.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.920]   Generally, if you're taller, you enjoy greater social dominance, higher status. It makes the
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.480]   dating and marriage market a lot easier to be a tall man as compared to being a short man.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.160]   And in general, school goes better. Height has been positively correlated with better academic
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.040]   outcomes. So, in general, being tall is one of those cheat codes in life, and it makes a big
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.480]   difference. Now, naturally, you might ask, "Why? Why does it make a difference?" Well, we don't
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   know for certain. Some researchers are trying to demonstrate academic research that would tell us,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.920]   but there seem to be a couple of basic theories. One theory is referred to as the human capital
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   theory, that height is not directly the key factor that is causing greater levels of success,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.920]   but we can use height as a convenient proxy for overall human capital, especially during
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.120]   childhood. A child is likely taller because he receives better nutrition or better health care
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.640]   and therefore is also getting better cognitive development, getting better educational outcomes
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.920]   because he's in an environment where he's properly cared for. So, his genetic capacity is enhanced,
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.000]   and those early advantages turn out to stay with him for life. Think of this in the context of
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   some of the idea that if your child is one of the oldest ones in his grade, he has a built-in
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.440]   advantage, a built-in social privilege that will endure and cause him to be a standout person all
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.320]   along the way. That would be the human capital theory. Other people theorize that it just has
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.600]   to do with bias and discrimination against people who are not tall, some form of height
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:22.080]   discrimination or heightism that taller individuals get positive biases, psychological things, and
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.960]   short people face subtle or overt discrimination that causes problems for them, and that bias is
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.000]   continually present throughout their life. Now, which of those theories is true? I don't know.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.160]   I would guess that they're probably both true. I could believe both of them. I think that height
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.520]   probably is a pretty decent proxy for other aspects of health, and I'll give some evidence
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.640]   for that in a moment. I also think that there is probably just some of these psychosocial factors
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.960]   that are relevant, that it's just kind of a basic bias that we have in favor of tall people,
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.280]   and it's probably not a bad thing in the same way that beauty is probably a pretty decent
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.240]   predictor of overall health. That's why we're attracted to beauty. Height is also a pretty
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.200]   decent predictor of overall health, and that's why we're attracted to it. But as always, I don't
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.960]   think that we should judge people by outward experiences or outward characteristics exclusively.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.640]   We should judge people by the content of their character and their expressed character,
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   their character qualities, rather than based upon some innate characteristic that that individual
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.320]   almost certainly had no impact over. But in life, we're always looking to get as much benefits and
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.880]   advantage and privilege as we're able to get, and we want our children to have as many benefits and
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.480]   advantages and privilege as we can pass along to them. Height is not free. It's not exclusively
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.400]   a good thing. I tell you, as a very tall man, there are many times when I have envied short
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.360]   people. There are a whole list of frustrations and annoyances that I have experienced.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.600]   When I was a teenager, I found it quite annoying that my mom had to buy me a special bed and
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.640]   special bedding, an extra long mattress so that I could fit on it. To this day, it's quite annoying
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.960]   to me to go to hotel beds where they put the sheets really tight because the first thing I
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.120]   have to do is kick out the sheets because my feet always hang off of the end of a bed. It's annoying.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.560]   I've many times been envious of my small friends when we're on an airplane flight,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.920]   and they can just sit down in an economy class airplane seat and sit down and be
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.080]   totally fine or curl up in the corner of a car or sometimes stretch out in something short.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.360]   A number of years ago, my wife and I had a motorhome where we slept crossways on the vehicle,
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.600]   and I never slept well in that motorhome because I had to go diagonal on the bed
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.200]   because I can't fit just across the vehicle, whereas short people don't have those problems.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.280]   It's annoying to have shoes. I have this thing. Ever since I was probably about 14 years old,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:56.240]   I can never get shoes in a shoe store. It's enormously annoying because the way that I shop
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.800]   for shoes in real life is I walk into a shoe store and say, "Do you have any size 16 shoes?"
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.200]   And they say, "No, we don't." And I walk out again. I don't even bother to look at what I like. I look
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   at what's available. Thank God for the internet because the internet came along and I was able
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.440]   to finally find shoes for myself. But even now, I am petrified about having a pair of shoes break
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.080]   on me when traveling because I can't just go into a store and get a pair of shoes. I'm forever stuck
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:26.320]   with whatever I can bring. And so these are just a bunch of dumb little annoyances. On the whole,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.240]   though, none of them are a big deal. And I don't think I would ever trade out these annoyances for
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.800]   being shorter, and I don't think there's many short men out there that wouldn't be happy to
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.040]   take on those annoyances in exchange for being tall. By the way, there are some arguments that
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.640]   tall people experience certain diseases that other people don't, so maybe it's not all free.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.160]   And there are some arguments that tall people have less of certain diseases than others. So
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.440]   on the whole, I'm happy to be the height that I'm happy that I am, and I don't have any complaints
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.120]   about it. And I want to help you and others experience those benefits if we possibly can.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.520]   So the question comes back to, is height something that can be adjusted?
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.480]   Is height something that can be influenced? And I'm here to tell you that I believe it is.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.960]   And I'll give a scientific disclaimer here in a moment, but what inspired me to do this show was
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.080]   I realized when I was doing that Genius show on Monday that there's so many aspects of life that
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.960]   we consider to be immutable, so many things that we think we can't change. And in reality,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.680]   they can be influenced and they can be changed. And yet, you know, we don't—if we could change it,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.480]   if we could positively affect it, why wouldn't we? And one of the benefits of wealth, meaning
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.720]   having a high income where you can afford to do certain things for yourself or for your children,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.680]   you should spend money on changing these things. So I'm going to tell you how to spend money
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.720]   to help yourself or your children be tall on today's podcast, and I'm going to give you a
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.040]   broad overview of it. I think at its core, the most important thing is to just simply observe that
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:09.360]   height can change. All of us do have a certain genetic potential in our basic genes, but that
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:17.600]   genetic potential is kind of a dormant guide that will vary significantly based upon our outward
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.080]   experience in life. And perhaps one of the most important factors is something like nutrition.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.040]   We can see this in populations. We can see that in populations of different countries,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.280]   that as people have access to more food and better nutrition, people's height increases.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.600]   And if we can tap into that, while it's certainly clear that we do have a genetic potential for all
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.200]   of us, we can maximize whatever the potential that we have is. I've even seen this in my own
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:54.080]   family, which is rather interesting. My father is not tall. I think he's, I'm guessing, 5'10".
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.520]   By the way, if I sound cavalier about height, I sounds ridiculous, but I'll just tell you honestly
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.400]   how it is. I'm like 6'5", 6'6", something like that. I haven't measured my height since high
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   school. At the time, I was 6'5" and 3/4". Usually, I shoot down and say 6'5", but 6'5" or 6'6",
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.800]   something like that. I should measure myself, but I just don't care. When you're tall at a
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.000]   certain point, it doesn't matter, but it matters a lot to some shorter guys. When you're tall,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.640]   though, the experience that you have in life is that basically height is irrelevant to you.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.600]   You don't notice how tall anybody is. They're just kind of all below you somewhere, and that's
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.800]   normal. You don't even think about it. It's only when you actually meet someone who's your height
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.480]   or taller that you notice it. A couple months ago, I was talking with a guy who was 7'4",
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.800]   and I'm 6'6". He's 7'4". He's less than a foot taller than me, but it was a very unusual and
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.200]   awkward experience for me, and it was a profoundly great reminder of how I appear to a lot of other
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.080]   people. By the way, this is something that you have to learn to manage. One of the things that
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:05.280]   I learned to do over the years being tall is I developed a habit of stepping back slightly from
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.040]   a lot of people. Generally, if you're in a conversation with me, unless I can't hear,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.440]   because sometimes you can't hear people when your head is up high, so I'll usually step back,
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.840]   and then I spread my legs out to be a little less threatening, less overpowering to people.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.360]   There are downsides to being super tall, or tall. I don't consider myself super tall,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.520]   but there are downsides to being tall, and you have to learn to deal with them.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.280]   Back to my family history. It's interesting. My father, I think he's something like 5'10".
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.840]   My mom is shorter than him. I don't know how tall she is, but my dad is the shortest man
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:46.320]   in my family. In my family, there are four sons, and our height increases on each and every child.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.080]   So my eldest brother is taller than my father is, but he's the shortest of all of my dad's sons.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.000]   Then my next eldest brother is a little taller, then my next eldest brother is a little taller,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.680]   and then I'm the youngest, and I am the tallest. I've always found this a fascinating
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:10.640]   anecdotal demonstration of the importance of nutrition. My parents always cared about
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.920]   nutrition. My grandfather was an early adopter of vitamins, and he was a chemist, and so he was
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.280]   super interested in health when he was younger and took vitamins. My mom was always interested
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.800]   in health food and trying to serve the healthiest food. I would say over the years, my family's
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.040]   nutrition improved, and my parents' nutrition improved, so they probably gave their children
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:39.360]   different genetic and epigenetic material to work with, and then the nutrition improved with their
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   actual children. You see this kind of perfect stair step of height as my family's wealth
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.000]   increased, and they probably could afford more food and better expressions of food.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.760]   This is anecdotal, but just as an example, I noticed with my parents that when I was a boy,
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.320]   when I was very young, we could never afford things like orange juice. We would have frozen
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.400]   from concentrate orange juice. Then as I got older, then my mom started to buy the real orange
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.840]   juice. When I was younger, we could never afford maple syrup, and so my mom would make maple syrup
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   using maple flavoring and a little bit of corn syrup, and she would make her own syrup for
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.880]   pancakes. As we got older, though, then real maple syrup appeared on the table.

[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:38.160]   years of unsustainable diets, Noom helped her lose 20 pounds and keep it off. I was definitely
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.840]   in a yo-yo cycle for years of just losing weight, gaining weight, and it was exhausting.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.800]   And Stephanie. She's a former D1 athlete who knew she couldn't out-train her diet,
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.720]   and she lost 38 pounds. My relationship to food before Noom was never consistent.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.440]   And Evan. He can't stand salads, but he still lost 50 pounds with Noom.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.240]   I'm not doing this to get to a number. I'm doing this to feel better.

[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:34.240]   then you can spend more money on groceries. And that undoubtedly had an impact on me reaching
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.600]   the highest of all of my brothers and of being significantly above the average height of the
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.960]   male population. My point in all this is just to demonstrate that while we all have to acknowledge
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:53.760]   the role that human genetics play in our height, we know that genetics are not... We can enhance
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.840]   our genetic potential. We see that in cultures. We see that as people go from societies of poverty
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:06.160]   to rich societies, and they can gain more. One of my favorite... Empty America,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.960]   VB Knives. I have no idea. I forget what his name is. Just my favorite Twitter follower is
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.360]   Empty America. He always makes the point, if you look at the United States and you see this,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   you'll find a Mexican kid whose dad is 5'6" and mom is 5'5". Mexican kid will move to the United
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:28.080]   States, eat Big Macs every day because now he has enough proper protein. The kid is 6'1" and
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.800]   massively taller than dad and mom because of the access to high-quality food sources.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.960]   The United States produces amazing levels of athletes probably because of Big Macs,
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:43.280]   because the fact that high-protein food like McDonald's is so cheap, comparatively speaking,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:50.320]   that a teenager who has this kind of locked-in genetic potential can produce these huge
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.760]   young people. There's kind of the classic Nebraska Cornhusker football player,
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:02.160]   is that if you go out to a Nebraska football team, you find all these boys that grew up eating
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.520]   nothing but nonstop beef and corn, and they're huge. The United States is one of the few countries
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.880]   in the world that something like the NFL can actually work because of the basic size that
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.320]   is necessary for the athletes. Non-Americans like to make fun, I think rightly so, at the
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:24.960]   United States calling something like the Super Bowl the world champions of football, American
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.880]   football. They like to make fun, "Well, you're the only people in the world that call yourselves the
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.880]   world champions when you're the only country in the world that is participating in this sport."
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.160]   I think that's a good joke and a proper thing to make fun of. I think that in addition to that,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.120]   if the NFL were open to teams from all around the world, it wouldn't make a lick of difference
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:51.040]   because, at least in my travels, I've never seen another place with a wealthy enough country
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:59.920]   where you can build thousands and thousands of big men that wind up filling something like
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.600]   the National Football League. If you just look at the sheer meat that is necessary for that league
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.320]   to work, probably the United States is the only country in the world that's wealthy enough to
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.440]   produce that kind of size with tens of thousands of participants that wind up making it to a
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:22.560]   professional sports league. So, obviously, you can have all kinds of genetic outliers in many
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.920]   other countries. One of my favorite athletes is a Siberian Russian wrestler named Alexander
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:36.000]   Karolin, the Russian bear. Dude was just an absolute monster, incredible guy, incredible
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.840]   wrestler, probably one of the – I'm not a sports guy, but certainly one of the greatest of all time
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:48.720]   in terms of his absolute prowess. So, he's a good example of how you can have a monster of a man in
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   a sport, but you only need one of him to compete in a single sport like that. A sport like the NFL,
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:00.480]   you need thousands and thousands of monster men to feed it at the college level – thousands
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.320]   and thousands is probably – I don't know what exact number to use. The point is you need a huge
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.000]   participation at the high school level to feed a college level, to feed a professional sports
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.160]   franchise. And when size is king in something like that, then you need a rich country in order to
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.080]   feed people enough to make them grow large. So, how do you actually get large? And more
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.800]   appropriately, how do you actually get your children large? If you want your children to
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:38.000]   be tall, what can you actually do? What I'm about to say in this section is the most proven
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.200]   of this show. So, I'm going to give you kind of the things that I think are – we know for
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.680]   pretty certain, and then we'll get into kind of some of the more questionable stuff. And I'll
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.400]   make a brief – before we get into the questionable stuff, I'll indicate where we'd make the turn from
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.480]   what we know to bro science, which I have a high respect for, but we'll talk about that in a
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.280]   moment. What are the core foundations? Well, when I give people this speech on how to help your
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.360]   children grow large, here are some things that we know are absolutely essential. The first one
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.200]   is in order for your children to grow large, they must have access to enough calories.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.040]   When children grow up in a starvation environment where they don't have access to enough calories,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.960]   they don't grow large. But when children have access to enough food, then they can reach their
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:37.200]   genetic potential. So, as a parent, I believe that your basic rule for children should be,
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:47.040]   "My children have unlimited access to unlimited calories. All children who are growing up should
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:57.600]   have access to unlimited quantities of calories." That statement, I believe, is true with regard to
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:04.320]   height generation. But obviously, if you're anything like me, it probably struck some fear
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.600]   in your heart. How do I make sure that I don't have a bunch of fat slobs for children? How do
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.160]   I avoid this? If I'm going to give children access to unlimited quantities of calories,
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.960]   how do I make sure they don't just, again, turn into fat slobs? I don't want that. That's not the
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:25.920]   goal. Well, I think here your defensive strategy is to make certain that your house is empty of
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:32.000]   all junk calories. I believe that children should have access to unlimited quantities of calories,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.160]   but only in certain forms. And so, what I do my very best to do and what I think is the right way
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.960]   is keep a house that is empty of junk food. So, your house should be full of all kinds of options,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.480]   and they should be primarily centered around whole food, but there should be no junk food
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.760]   in your house, no empty garbage junk food. Children should never have access to that stuff
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   on a regular basis. I think it's fine if every couple of months you go to some kind of birthday
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.120]   party and there's Doritos there. Great. But don't have that garbage in your house. It's fine if you
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.240]   go to a pizza party at school. Great. But don't have pizza in your house, and don't ever have
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:23.440]   that kind of stuff as a natural part of it. If you have unlimited access to high-quality calories of
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:29.600]   real food, then your children can satisfy their hunger, reach their genetic potential,
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   and that will be the key factor for them. A huge component of the calories that are
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.920]   available to your children should be protein. So, one of the most important nutrients to maximize
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.080]   is protein. So, the perfect diet, as far as I'm concerned with my knowledge, and I probably should
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.640]   have given more disclaimers. I'm not a nutritionist. I'm not a doctor. I'll undoubtedly make
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.280]   mistakes in everything I'm going to tell you. I'm just doing my best as a layman to say, based upon
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.680]   my research, here are the things that I think are probably true. You check with all of the relevant
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.680]   experts, and please, experts, if I get any of this wrong, correct me on it, because I am not
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:15.040]   a biology guy. I just listen, and this is the best I've got. So, the key nutrient to overemphasize on
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:24.480]   is protein. The bulk of your child's diet should be made up of protein, and the most important
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:35.760]   forms of protein are animal proteins. So, the perfect diet for a teenager, a 12-year-old boy,
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.920]   or a 14-year-old boy, or a 16-year-old boy would be eggs for breakfast, five, six, eight eggs,
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:49.600]   whatever he'll eat for breakfast, with several glasses of raw milk. Lunch, ideally, would be
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   a form of protein, maybe two or three hamburgers and some vegetables or fruit on the side,
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.320]   and then dinner should be steaks. Dinner should be as much red meat as possible. Steak, burgers,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   whatever you have access to, lamb, whatever you have, but as much access to as much meat as
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:15.360]   possible. That should form the basic foundation of the diet. And by having access to huge quantities
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:21.760]   of protein, then your child will have the necessary building blocks of his body.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:30.400]   Now, related to this is also fat. You want to emphasize a high-fat diet, so especially animal
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:36.640]   fats and naturally-occurring oils fats, naturally-occurring oils like olive oil, coconut
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.320]   oil, things like that. You need to avoid all seed oils and all vegetable oils. All of that needs to
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:48.720]   be completely stripped from the diet, but emphasize high quantities of fat. I never hear of fat as a
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.760]   nutrient coming into play as a recommendation for height. There, it's always protein, when you hear
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.160]   people talk about the research that we know about it, but fat is really, really important for
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:06.480]   cognition, for brain development, for cognition, and for satiation, for having the body properly
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.880]   regulate everything. I don't think that a zero-carbohydrate or a low-carbohydrate diet is
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   necessarily the best choice for a teenager, a person who's metabolically healthy. In fact,
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.160]   when you actually get to the hormone level of human growth hormone, HGH and IGF, and these
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:32.480]   actual hormones that drive the creation of height, although I can't explain the actual metabolic
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:40.160]   process sufficiently here in this format, that insulin production and having a spike in insulin
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.760]   actually enhances some of those hormones. So, carbohydrates, I don't think, are the enemy
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:53.680]   for metabolically normal children and teens, but in general, the carbohydrates should be consumed
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:00.880]   in the morning and at lunchtime and not consumed in the evening, if possible, for the best hormonal
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.920]   response, and they should be healthy carbohydrates. So, it should never be sugar. Sugar is a poison.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.840]   It shouldn't be bread. It should be potatoes and other carbohydrate vegetables to the extent that
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:20.240]   you're going to have carbohydrates. But the key thing to overemphasize is going to be protein.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.680]   So, let me summarize the formula for you so far. Number one, unlimited quantities of calories,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.040]   primarily focused on protein, heavy amounts of protein, supplemented by significant amounts of
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:40.960]   fat, and you should eliminate all of the junk, especially all of the junk that can mess all the
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:51.120]   signals of satiety up. The primary way to avoid a young person being fat is to avoid eating the
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:57.920]   kinds of junk food that mess up his ability to know when he is satisfied. And so, if you're only
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:04.400]   eating healthy food, and healthy food is the food that is available to you, then you're going to eat
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.680]   until you're full, and then you're going to stop. And when you're hungry, you're going to eat again
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.720]   until you're full, and then you're going to stop. It's only when you get into all the fake chemicals
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.600]   and all the garbage that messes all that system up that then we worry about people just dramatically
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:23.200]   overeating beyond their normal capacity. The next thing that is absolutely necessary
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   after huge amounts of calories, unlimited calories and lots of protein is sleep. After that,
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.320]   the second most important thing that a young person can do in order to reach his maximum height
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:45.440]   potential is to sleep. It is my strong conviction that if at all possible, children and young people
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:53.760]   should always sleep naturally with no artificial awakening. I understand that our entire society
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.280]   has screwed this entire thing up. Everything in our modern society is an enemy to sleep.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.360]   We have artificial lights that allow us to stay up and be productive and be stimulated until
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.640]   late into the night. We have artificial devices that stimulate us. They stimulate us with blue
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.840]   light late at night. They stimulate us with constant kind of things that keep our brains engaged.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.800]   We're engaged with constant and never-ending controversies and stresses that keep our brains
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.240]   awake. So we go to bed late, especially teens. They're up half the night. They go to bed late,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.160]   doing all kinds of crazy stuff all through the night, going to bed at one o'clock in the morning.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.960]   And then our entire school system, at least in the standard model in the United States,
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.560]   starts far too early, and teens are dragged out of bed early in the morning to be at school at
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.280]   seven o'clock in the morning. And all of this is unnatural, and all of it is destructive for
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.720]   a young person's success. This is not only destructive for height, by the way. This is
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:56.160]   also destructive for learning. All of the learning science that we're aware of indicates that
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.880]   memories are processed, and learning happens during sleep. Learning doesn't happen when you
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.960]   listen to a tape where you're just going to learn French in your sleep. That does not work.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.760]   But all of the learning is cemented during the nightly flushing that happens in the brain,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   and all of your actual learning is consolidated. And so, basically, the standard model for teens
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:22.560]   where they stay up really late, get very little, small amounts of sleep, get up way too early and
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:29.760]   go to school way too early, it destroys all of the cognitive benefit of learning during the daytime
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.240]   because the memories are never processed. They never actually learn. But that's the academic
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.280]   side. What about the physical side? Well, the body grows during sleep, and it grows during sleep both
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.640]   literally, physically, but also during the production of certain hormones. So, the bulk
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.320]   of your human growth hormone is produced in a healthy body during sleep, and the most important
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:56.480]   sleep is the first hour. That's when all of the hormones are produced. So, if you have a teenager,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.120]   and you want your teenager to grow tall, the single cornerstone habit that you can instill
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:10.320]   is to go to bed at the same exact time every single day, ideally as early as is reasonable.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:16.480]   Now, I have not raised teenagers myself. It is my understanding from listening to other people with
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.600]   their stories of their teenagers, as well as a little cursory awareness of some of the studies
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.720]   on it, that the circadian rhythm of a teen naturally changes basically regardless of the
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.720]   environment. I'm skeptical that it has to be that way, but I'm willing to acknowledge that
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:38.480]   your teenager is probably going to stay up later. That's what every parent of teens tells me is the
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.920]   case, and so I'm willing to acknowledge that that's probably the case, even though I fight against it.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.240]   And I'm going to fight against it until I'm forced by outward circumstances to change.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   So, maybe it is the case that bedtime has to move from 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock, right? That's fine.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.840]   But the bedtime for a teenager should certainly not be 12 o'clock midnight, should certainly not
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.560]   be 2 o'clock in the morning. The bedtime for a teenager should be as early as possible in the
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:18.240]   evening and as much of a wind down as possible, and he should get to bed early and prioritize
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.720]   sleep. Now, obviously, I can remember being a teen. Teens are often not enthusiastic about
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:32.320]   a "early bedtime." But if you want your teen to have maximum success in life, in academic outcomes,
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:38.240]   as well as in physical outcomes, you have to prioritize sleep. And perhaps this will help
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.320]   you if you're the parent of teens and you're fighting with your teens. Dig into the literature
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.520]   a little bit and understand how important sleep is to both physical growth, physical development,
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:55.200]   athletic performance, as well as proper just hormonal regulation and long-term academic
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:02.640]   outcomes. I can't overstate how comprehensively consistent the literature is on this. There is no
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.320]   literature that I have ever found that indicates that sleep should not be a cornerstone habit.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:14.640]   So my suggestion for you with a teen is engage your teen with it and use height as potentially
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:21.280]   that thing, a motivator. I think a lot of teens are simply unaware, probably less now than when
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.560]   I was younger. But I was a teenager. Nobody ever talked about this stuff. Today, with bro science
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.920]   and YouTube and social networks and whatnot, all this kind of information comes across a teenager's
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.960]   screen much more effectively, and then teenagers who are motivated can dig into it. But if you're
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.120]   a parent, dig into it yourself so that you can help your teenager to be motivated and to be
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.640]   knowledgeable about it. If you have a young man that you're raising as a teenager and he wants
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:53.120]   to grow tall, then a cornerstone habit for him after eating enough and only eating high-quality
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.480]   food, a cornerstone habit needs to be sleep. And hopefully, this will give you an extra tool
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:04.160]   to motivate him. And if you want the best outcome, let me tell you what I think is the best. How do
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:09.120]   you get great sleep? Number one is you should try to arrange so that whenever possible,
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.960]   your evening schedule involves some kind of early-ish wind down, so not a lot of high
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.920]   stimulation activities in the evening. Now, you choose whatever time is appropriate for your
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.560]   functioning of your community. This will probably change between summer and winter and at different
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.600]   seasons of life, but try to arrange for some kind of wind down. Try to make certain that your home
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:35.120]   is not excessively bright, so making certain that your home is populated with yellow lights and that
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.240]   you can dim the lights as the evening goes on will make a big difference. I have a very hard time
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:46.480]   believing that if we were to go back 200 years and we're all living by candlelight, that somehow
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:51.440]   teens are going to have that much of a hard time falling asleep at 8 o'clock when the sun goes down
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.960]   like everyone else does. Now, I don't know that. I can't prove that. I'm just skeptical of that
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:03.520]   stuff. But regardless, we know that pulling down the light is a big deal, especially we know that
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.320]   if at all possible, we want dim lights. That's the most important thing as compared to bright lights.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.280]   We want to get rid of blue lights if at all possible. So if it's possible, we want to
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:20.240]   eliminate the use of screens and bulbs that give off blue light. You can do this using night mode
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.280]   on devices, night modes on TVs, night modes on phones, night modes on computers, and you can also
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.600]   use blue light blocking glasses. These are quite popular. I have no experience myself with them,
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:37.040]   but these are quite popular for a lot of people. And so get a pair of blue light blocking glasses
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.680]   and start wearing those after dinner if you require doing some homework on the computer or
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.880]   things like that, and use night mode. And then have a consistent early bedtime. And so what I
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:55.520]   would suggest for teens not having ever fathered a teen, so maybe I'm mistaken about this, but I
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:01.840]   really believe this is a good foundation, is have your teen consistently go to bed at an early time.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.760]   Something like in most cultures, something like 9 to 10 o'clock I think would be ideal,
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:12.960]   maybe earlier if possible. And then if your teen can't fall asleep due to that kind of natural
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:24.000]   circadian rhythm change, then have him read with a physical book, not a fake book, not an e-reader,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.840]   have him read with a physical book, and have him read with a very dim yellow light. So just a soft
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.880]   artificial candle, that's what I like, is just kind of a soft artificial candle, or get a yellow
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:41.760]   book light for the purposes of reading in bed. So if a teen is lying down in bed, horizontal,
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:48.240]   in a completely dark room, reading for an hour or two, then he should naturally fall asleep
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.520]   when his body is ready and prepared to go to sleep. The sleeping room should be as dark as
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.200]   possible. You should use blackout curtains, or the teen should use an eye mask if necessary,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.800]   but the room should be as dark as possible. It should be very cool, as cool as possible.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:12.720]   And then there should be no non-natural waking time. So there should be no alarm clock. There
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:21.440]   should be no artificial awaking unless it's absolutely necessary. If you find that your teen
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.560]   has to get up to go to school at a certain time, then you have the only solution you have to that
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   that's best for the health of the teen. If you're not going to pull him out and homeschool and say,
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.600]   "We can start school when you wake up," then you need to dial back the bedtime in order for him to
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:47.440]   get a full night's sleep. Food, protein, and sleep are the cornerstone factors that will influence
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:53.760]   height as well as everything else. All other performance and health and beauty and everything
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:00.720]   is influenced by those. Prioritize sleep and use the motivation that a young man may have to be
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:08.080]   tall or use the motivation that a young woman may have to be beautiful and tall and smart to
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:14.000]   prioritize sleep and motivate your teenagers to go to bed early. Because when we're talking about
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.840]   height, remember, you only get puberty once. The time to maximize your height is before and during
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:26.160]   puberty when you have the most potential. I'll briefly touch on post-puberty height
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:35.280]   at the end of the show, but don't miss puberty and don't consign your child who could grow to be
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.840]   6'2" to have him be stuck at 5'8" and then whining around online that all the girls want
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.200]   a 6' boyfriend. Don't consign him to that just because he was goofing off all night on social
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.240]   media. End that and create a household that goes to bed early, which means, of course, that you,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:58.000]   as a parent, you have to set the same solution. By the way, I think that's probably reasonable.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.720]   Some people are night owls, but on the whole, there's good evidence that the most important
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.440]   sleep is the sleep that happens early. I forget if it's before midnight, but they can track it.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:14.320]   The sleep researchers see it. All right, what's the next factor that we know absolutely improves
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:21.520]   height? Well, here it's athletics, it's movement, and most importantly, a special kind of movement.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:29.200]   If you are parenting someone who wants to grow tall, you want to prioritize sprints.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:37.920]   This is much more important than long, slow cardio. Sprinting has been demonstrated to
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:43.360]   enormously increase the production of human growth hormone, and basically what we're doing
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:49.760]   with these techniques is trying to maximize the hormonal potential of a body. And so,
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:56.640]   there should be lots and lots of sprinting in a teenager's life. That should be the cornerstone
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.880]   thing to emphasize, lots and lots of sprinting. If you have lots of sprinting, which stimulates
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.600]   human growth hormone, lots of sleep, which stimulates human growth hormone, especially
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:14.960]   the first hour, and lots of food, then your child should reach his genetic maximum fairly easily.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.000]   But it needs to happen consistently from the beginning on.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.960]   Tuesdays at Papa Murphy's, you can get large signature or thin crust pizzas for just $12.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.280]   We call it Take and Bake Tuesday.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.440]   Talking $12 Take and Bake Tuesday?
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.720]   That's today's topic.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.800]   It's terrific for tuning up a tiring Tuesday through a tasty $12 treat.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.920]   Truthfully, Take and Bake Tuesday tops tossing back tacos.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.840]   Tell that taco to hit the trail, it's Take and Bake Tuesday's time to triumph.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.840]   Time out, this is turning into a tongue twister.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.640]   Totally tis. So, just try Take and Bake for $12 every Tuesday at Papa Murphy's.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.840]   Change the way you pizza.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   And so, this should be always kind of a primary thing that you are driving towards.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:59.600]   So, develop a structure where your child is sprinting consistently,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.560]   and that sprinting should be constant and built into life.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:09.840]   Incidentally, this is also going to help with many of the other things that we know have a
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:16.560]   knock-on effect. I'm here trying to focus on the big things that are obvious and easy for you to
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:23.600]   take away from here. But sprinting will have a very natural effect on helping your child to
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:30.080]   maintain a low body fat percentage. Being lean is very important for HGH and IGF-1 production.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.960]   So, you want to emphasize leanness. Well, if someone is eating a lot,
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.520]   even if it's all high quality, how do we make certain that he doesn't get fat?
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.800]   We have exercise, and so that's where sprinting comes in.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:49.840]   By sprinting, you are going to stimulate high quantities of human growth hormone.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:56.560]   Sprinting also should lead to a child being more athletic. I've become convinced that speed is
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.880]   trainable. When I was young, I always just thought, "Well, you're the speed that you are."
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.600]   But no, people can learn to be faster. Again, there's probably going to be genetic limitations,
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:12.720]   but most people can become faster. So, teaching your teenagers to be fast and getting them under
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   a good sprint coach is going to help them to grow, but it's also going to help them in their
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:24.080]   athleticism. It's going to lead to their potentially having more success with things like sport.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.680]   We know that this will significantly increase testosterone production,
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.760]   which is hugely important for long-term growth. When men are in highly competitive masculine
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.360]   environments, especially things like sports competition, then that environment itself
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.400]   stimulates testosterone production. So, we want to do everything possible to create these
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:51.200]   environmental factors to stimulate testosterone production. Now, sprinting has both the hormonal
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:57.840]   benefit as well as having the physical benefit, and by sprinting here, I'm referring to running,
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:05.360]   doing running sprints. We want to create an environment of as much physical activity as
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.680]   possible, and we want to create an environment with as much physical shock as possible.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.240]   There are many, many important reasons why we also want to do weightlifting and build muscle.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.640]   All of that is going to be super important, but it's not directly related to height,
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.800]   and in fact, it could have a negative effect on height due to compression of the bones.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.560]   We should do it, but it could have a negative effect on height. So, somebody who is kind of
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:38.080]   in puberty or nearing the end of puberty and is very short, we would probably avoid heavy squats
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:42.320]   because we don't want to engage in anything that could be compressive on the skeletal system,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.040]   and we would use other kinds of exercise. The kinds of exercise that we want to maximize
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:53.680]   in order to stimulate height are shock exercises and especially jumping exercises.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:00.320]   We want to stimulate bone growth and we want to stimulate nerve response and basically stretching
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:08.240]   out. So, the perfect exercise is going to be sprinting and then jumping exercises like basketball
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.640]   or volleyball, especially not sand volleyball where there's less impact, but court volleyball.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.880]   Anything where we're constantly jumping is going to send signals to the body
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:24.240]   to indicate that it should grow, and especially while those growth plates are open,
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:30.640]   we want every part of the nervous system to be focused on growing as tall as possible.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.600]   So, do tall people play basketball or does basketball create tall people?
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:45.680]   Yes, both of those are true, but basketball and constant jumping and constant looking for height
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.640]   actually, as best I understand it, seems to stimulate growth in the body.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.040]   There are other also interesting effects of this. Just the physical shock of this
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:01.280]   has an important impact on the bones. Now, bones grow, again, not a doctor,
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.520]   forgive me if I get this wrong, but it's my understanding, bones grow in basically two ways.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:11.840]   The primary way that bones grow has to do with the growth plates. So, during puberty,
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:19.120]   while the growth plates are open, the bone is just growing naturally through that normal process,
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.920]   and we want to stimulate that with all of the proper nutrition and all of the proper impact.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   However, bones also grow, I think it's called Wolf's Law, something like that,
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:34.720]   bones also grow based upon tension. And so, we want to put as much tension and pressure
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.880]   on the bones of young people as possible so that the bones grow big and strong.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.280]   And the bones grow big and strong both by bearing a heavy load, which is where weight-bearing
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:51.440]   exercises are important, and due to shock, that when you shock a bone, you create small
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   micro-fractures in the bone, which in a way that's analogous to the way the body builds muscle,
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.120]   where we create small tears in the muscle and the body builds it back stronger.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:06.400]   We create small, tiny little fractures, micro-fractures in the bone due to shock,
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:10.880]   and then the body grows those back a little bit bigger. And this is one of the techniques
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.920]   that the bros are trying to use to lengthen the bones after puberty. More on that in a moment.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:22.080]   But the point remains that we want to stimulate the hormones and the growth of the bones as much
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:28.480]   as possible with lots and lots of high-impact exercise. So, lots of sprinting, lots of
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:35.200]   jumping, lots of plyometrics, lots of jumping down off of boxes from height, and especially
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   jumping sports, such as basketball or volleyball or something else. And we want the highest-impact
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.320]   version of this to stimulate the maximum amount of growth. Now, when you put all this together,
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.960]   what I've said so far, this should sound like basically a fairly normal, healthy environment,
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:58.880]   which is clearly, I think, what most of us need. We know that the human body is going to have a
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.240]   certain genetic potential based upon its overall—your parents, your grandparents, and genetics
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:10.480]   going back forever. And then the human body is going to develop best with high amounts of
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:17.040]   nutrition, with very nutritious foods that have a proper kind of comprehensive nutritional makeup.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.280]   We all know that junk food is doing nothing but harming us. And so, anything related to junk food,
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.800]   we can get rid of. We get rid of it. We all know that we need protein and fat and probably
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.520]   carbohydrates in order to reach our best potential. We all know that we need lots of sleep,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.040]   good hydration, and lots of movement. And that's all pretty well acknowledged. But if you disrupt
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:40.240]   any of those things, then you're going to minimize the body's ability to grow large.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.200]   And by the way, that disruption really can happen at any point in time with long-ranging effects.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:51.040]   I have a friend of mine who is a man who is very short. And his reason for being short is that he
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:56.000]   was born, I think, with umbilical cord around his neck. I can't remember exactly. But he was born,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.760]   he wasn't getting oxygen. He almost died as a baby. And his brothers are all tall,
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.720]   lots of genetic potential. But he himself is short because probably due to that trauma
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.520]   that he experienced as a baby. If you observe the cases of children who are malnourished,
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.840]   who are starved, they never grow to be large and strong. And so, this stuff is obvious.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:18.240]   And if you are interacting with a teenager that's just experiencing a high-stress environment and
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   not sleeping and all this stuff, then there's a good chance that that person is not going to grow.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.120]   So far, what I've said, I don't believe is in any way uncontroversial.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.400]   And if you maximize these things, I think you've done the things that there's really strong
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:39.840]   evidence for and that's kind of intuitive that you obviously should do. Now, I'm going to continue on
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:46.000]   and we're going to talk briefly a little bit about bro science. Now, I have a lot of respect
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.280]   for bro science. And the idea here is, it's kind of a slang term that we use for the bros,
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.720]   the guys online who want to accomplish something and they're talking around and studying this and
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:04.480]   theorizing that and testing this and trying that and documenting that and things like that.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.640]   Generally, the bros are not people with a trained scientific background. They're
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.800]   usually not medical doctors, usually not statisticians, usually not researchers.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:19.920]   But the bro science is, I have a high respect for because I think this is the foundation of
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.400]   good scientific research. And what has happened is before we could all connect on the internet,
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:30.080]   we were finding that the whole scientific community was strangled by the publishing process.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.320]   Whereas dispersed knowledge and dispersed experts, especially people who have a high
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:39.120]   interest in going and finding other academic research to review, this is something that's
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.080]   really valuable. But we also need to take it with a significant grain of salt. Anything that we
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.920]   learn from something like bro science needs to be tested by a proper scientific verification,
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.280]   if at all possible. And we should hold bro science or whatever the girl version of that is,
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.680]   I haven't heard of girl science, probably out there, we should hold it loosely and say,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:06.240]   "These things could be true, but I'm not certain they're true." And if you get into bro science,
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.360]   you get into two basic areas. Number one is, are there other things that you could do to stimulate
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:18.960]   growth before and during puberty? And then are there things that we could do after puberty?
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.840]   Let's begin with first, before and during puberty, when the growth plates are open,
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.800]   what are some of the things that we want to do? And by the way, if you want to gain access to
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:34.240]   what I'm about to talk about, remember, up till now, I've focused on things that I think are
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.680]   pretty well demonstrated, pretty well proven. I think that most doctors are going to agree with
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.560]   me. I don't think I've made a mistake so far. If I'm going to make a mistake, it's going to be in
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.280]   the second part here of the show where I dig into this bro science stuff, because I'm not an expert,
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.000]   I don't understand it well enough. I'm trying to give you a list of general guidelines that I think
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.240]   will be helpful to you. If you want to access bro science yourself, your best place is to start is
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:01.600]   YouTube. Go to YouTube, do a couple of searches, some things like how to grow taller, how to reach
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:07.760]   my maximum height, how guys can get taller, things like that. Watch a few videos, and then sit back
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.400]   and let the algorithm start feeding you some algorithmically chosen videos, and then start
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:18.560]   looking through and seeing what you learn from it. And the bros have dug a lot deeper into
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.520]   the science and understanding it because they're usually highly motivated. There's a guy who's 20
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.960]   years old and he's five foot eight, and he says, "I got to reach six foot," and so he's doing all
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:33.040]   kinds of stuff to try to do it. So I'm not that motivated, being tall, naturally, so I just have
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.240]   a cursory knowledge of it. But let's begin with, I'm going to pull together a few lists from the
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:42.080]   bros that I'm going to talk from now. So let's start with a list of mistakes that you want to
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:48.560]   avoid. Some of the things that are really important during puberty for guys is that you need to make
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:56.080]   certain that you avoid high estrogen levels. If your estrogen levels are high, then that can cause
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:02.720]   your growth plates to close prematurely, premature to what they otherwise would do. They close
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:10.160]   quickly. So you need to reduce estrogen levels in your body during the growth period. How do you do
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.200]   that? How do you reduce estrogen levels? Well, first, you need to make certain that you maintain
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.240]   a low, healthy body weight, that you're not fat. It's my understanding that fat tissue,
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:27.120]   especially visceral fat, can convert testosterone into estrogen through a process called
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:34.960]   aromatization. So by keeping your body fat percentage down, you're avoiding that process of
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:41.600]   creating high estrogen levels. I think of this one basically as man boobs,
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   is that we want to avoid getting man boobs. Why does a guy get man boobs? Because he gets fat.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.840]   So we want to avoid that. Incidentally, I'm going to say something. It's very strong.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.280]   It'll be offensive to many people, but I really think it's an important
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:51:04.000]   message that we as parents adopt. I believe that for you to have fat children and fat teenagers
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:13.520]   is a form of child abuse. Allowing your children and teens to be fat is a form of child abuse.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:20.240]   Now, obviously, it's not a severe form of child abuse in compared to the many horrific kinds of
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:27.040]   abuse that children face. But having been a fat teenager, I want to promise you that that life
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:35.360]   sucks and it's something that you want to avoid. And I don't see any reason why any child or any
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:41.840]   teen should be fat. And I see a whole host of things that parents can do and should do and
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:48.800]   must do to help their children unfat themselves. And all of this just involves lifestyle changes.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:54.800]   So if you are a parent of a fat child, then I believe that you should take that as a
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:01.040]   responsibility and say, "I have to change this, and I have to do this while I can."
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:07.600]   Because coming from Joshua Sheets, remember, I have been a fat child and a fat teenager,
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:13.120]   and that sucks. And if you can change it as a parent, you must change it. And by the way,
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.880]   you can change it. It's totally changeable. But allowing your healthy young boys to be
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:26.000]   fat kids with estrogen producing man boobs in them, that is child abuse,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.720]   and we should deal with it as such. Now, again, I acknowledge that I'm using a strong and very
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.960]   offensive term here, but that's how I think of it in my own mind, and I want us to change that.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:42.960]   So we have to keep body weight down. How else do we keep estrogen low for boys? We need to
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.600]   avoid estrogenic foods. We need to limit soy products, especially. We need to avoid all
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:53.360]   processed foods. All processed foods should go away. Be thoughtful. If possible, consider things
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:58.880]   like organic produce. Avoiding pesticides, which may be endocrine disruptors, can be
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:05.440]   one strategy that I think is worth doing. So if you have money and you can afford to purchase
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:09.920]   organic food, then that's probably something that you should do. You need to reduce as much
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:15.520]   as possible other access to other endocrine disruptors. So plastics are a huge deal.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:21.600]   We have to avoid BPA, BPS, because those substances can mimic estrogen. So you never
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:26.400]   heat food in plastic containers. You always use BPA-free products, and whenever possible,
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:31.360]   just reduce the use of plastic. Just completely cut it out. There's really no reason for plastic
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:37.840]   in your household. Be super, super careful with all kind of personal care products.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:44.320]   Many cosmetics and shampoos and lotions and all of that stuff contains all kinds of junks,
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:49.200]   parabens and phthalates and all kinds of chemicals, and a lot of the stuff increases estrogen.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:55.040]   So we need to get rid of all that stuff if at all possible and keep the skin products
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:04.080]   as pure as possible. You also want to eliminate cleaners and toxic cleaners and chemicals from
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:09.520]   your home, and go to super simple stuff. Clean with vinegar. Don't clean with the weird stuff
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:13.680]   that just had all the stuff. Eliminate all the fragrances. Eliminate all the cheap candles and
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:18.960]   all this crap that messes up our systems. Filter your water. So tap water, especially
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.400]   in a municipal system, tap water can contain trace amounts of estrogenic substances, BPA,
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.600]   pharmaceuticals like birth control residues in our water, and all kinds of other pollutants.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.920]   So it's not going to kill you from drinking it, but it's going to screw up your system. So
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:39.520]   get a high-quality water filter in your house and make certain that you remove all of that stuff.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.720]   And then be thoughtful about foods. I've read that there are foods that lower estrogen.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:50.960]   Cruciferous vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, flax seeds may be useful.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:58.400]   Citrus, things like that are the kinds of things that could help to reduce estrogen amounts.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.240]   And then hopefully this isn't a big thing for teens, but reduce alcohol consumption.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.080]   Alcohol can mess with the liver's ability to metabolize estrogen. And then just in and of
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:10.160]   itself, like beer, for example, is one of the worst, like most feminine things possible.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.800]   I always think of it as beer gives you boobs. So make sure your teen isn't consuming beer.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:19.840]   It's terrible. I hate the fact that men associate beer with like kind of a masculine drink.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:25.760]   It's not. It's a terrible drink from the perspective of masculinity and femininity,
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:34.960]   and estrogen is a component of it. So however we do it, we want to do the best job possible
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:40.080]   of limiting estrogen levels, especially for your boys and your male teens.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:48.400]   We want to avoid certain kinds of chemicals. We want to avoid accutane. Accutane is a brand
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:54.240]   name for isotretinoin, which is a medication that's used to treat severe acne. Be super,
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:56:01.440]   super careful about anything like that because it can cause premature closing of the growth plates
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:07.760]   because it speeds up the maturation of chondrocytes. So be careful of anything related to
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:14.800]   acne medications. I am no expert on acne, but I think that a huge portion of it can be cleared up
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:20.240]   with dietary influences. So if you got someone struggling with acne, put them on an all-beef
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.720]   diet and see what happens after a few months, and I'll bet you a significant part of it goes away.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:29.760]   I don't know what your teen would rather have, acne scars when he's 20 years old or an extra
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.560]   few inches of height, but my guess is the height would probably be a priority.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:40.080]   You have to absolutely make certain that there's no steroid use or artificial testosterone
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:47.680]   injections. This is deadly, and as anabolic steroids for muscle growth has become more
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:54.720]   common in our society, then these are filtering down to teens. And so steroid use and artificial
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:59.360]   testosterone can deplete your stem cells, and that leads to early closure of the growth plates.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:06.800]   We want to avoid tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. These are substances that,
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:14.960]   as I understand it, are intended to block the estrogen receptors. In theory, these could be
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:21.040]   used under careful supervision of a doctor to potentially do all that good stuff we were saying
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:27.520]   earlier about getting rid of the estrogen, but ironically, it seems as though they actually
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:34.160]   could lead to earlier closure of the growth plates if the hormonal balances are not maintained
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:39.120]   properly. So we want to be super careful about jumping on random drugs without understanding
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:46.080]   them, without being under a doctor's care. And then the obvious ones. Don't smoke, don't drink,
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:55.280]   don't do drugs, don't eat junk food in any form. No marijuana, no vaping, no Doritos,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:02.480]   no junk food at all, because all of that stuff can reduce your human growth hormone production,
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.320]   mess with your blood flow, hinder your ability to produce IGF-1,
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.960]   and it's all the basic functioning of these hormones that actually creates the growth
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:16.160]   in a young body. Let's switch now. What about things like vitamins and supplements?
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:21.120]   I'm not really competent to advise on this, so I'm just going to list some names that I hear about
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:27.120]   and say that a lot of this stuff probably would have some impact, but it's unproven,
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:32.480]   and a lot of this stuff I'm guessing would be available in a good diet. But here's what people
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:38.160]   look at. First, a lot of the bros are supplementing with minerals to help with bone regulation and
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:44.080]   bone repair. Magnesium, zinc, boron, calcium, and phosphorus. The bros are also taking amino acids
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.760]   to try to help create necessary proteins like collagen and help with hormone regulation of HGH.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:56.400]   So aminos like arginine, ornithine, lysine. Some guys are taking a little bit of creatine. I don't
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.080]   know much about creatine. I was always super skeptical about it, but now I hear more people
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:06.080]   talking about its positive benefits, and glutamine. Some people are taking proteins and peptides,
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:11.600]   collagen supplements, beef gelatin, colostrum powder, and then vitamins that support various
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:19.040]   bodily functions, especially vitamins A, B6, B7, B12, C, E, and K2, in addition to omega fatty
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:25.280]   acids from fish oil supplements and flaxseed supplements. Some of the bros are taking
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:31.200]   glucosamine sulfate with the goal of basically keeping their morning height before their body
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:37.680]   gets compressed and to support cartilage synthesis in order to get to sleep. Sometimes some bros are
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:43.360]   supplementing with melatonin, although that should not be done on an ongoing basis. Some of the bros
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:50.320]   are using something called GABA, which evidently reduces cortisol and can promote the release of
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:56.800]   human growth hormone, as well as various adaptogens such as ashwagandha, tribulus,
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:03.440]   and rhodiola rosea. And I don't myself have any idea what any of those are. I just hear about them
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.720]   in listening to what the bros are testing. Talk to a doctor. And then some of the supplements
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.480]   that are out there that generally you should never engage with unless you are speaking to a doctor.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:21.600]   One is MK-677, which is ibutamorin, which, as I understand it, has been
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.760]   proven to make teens taller but can cause all kinds of problems. Obviously, human growth hormone
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:34.880]   injections, which may lead to growth of height but can cause other health problems. And then
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:43.280]   anabolic steroids, which are likely to speed up the closure of the natural growth plates.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.440]   So, in general, I think be super careful with anything that is chemical and medical and just
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.400]   focus on those proven things that I said, and that's probably going to be enough for what
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:02.080]   anybody needs. I think the reason the guys are short is their sleeping, probably sleeping and
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.160]   nutrition. And if you just fix nutrition and sleep and movement, you've probably fixed a
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:13.680]   whole lot of problems. Now, in conclusion, let's turn to kind of a wacky and interesting world
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:20.480]   of the question of can you grow taller after puberty? The idea is after the growth plates
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.480]   on your bones close, can you grow taller? Now, the interesting answer is absolutely yes.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:33.520]   Before you think I've lost my mind, I would say absolutely yes with regard to surgery. There are
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.440]   clinics around the world that you can find people telling their stories where basically a dude will
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.560]   go in and they perform this procedure where basically they cut the bones in their legs,
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.040]   stretch the bones out, and after this very long and painful procedure, literally they're adding
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.920]   several heights, several inches of height to people. And evidently, growing taller is such
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.600]   a big deal that people are willing to pay huge amounts of money and undergo enormous amounts of
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.760]   pain to grow taller after puberty through the use of surgery. So, I'm hoping to help you avoid that,
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.200]   help your children avoid that, but just trying to remind you of some basic things that are going to
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.120]   help them reach their genetic potential when they're younger, but basically not stunting their
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.920]   growth. But that is the case. Now, short of that, it's kind of interesting to try to understand
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.120]   could this make a difference. If you go on YouTube or you start listening to people, you'll find a
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.320]   whole lot of guys in their early 20s and late teens who are really focused on this. And again,
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.160]   they're doing the bro science thing where they're looking and looking and trying to figure out
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:37.440]   is this possible because they want to grow. The answer is probably not much, meaning that would
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.680]   be the medical answer as I understand it. Most doctors would say, "Can you grow after the growth
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.840]   plates are closed?" As I understand it, the responsible answer would be to say, "Well,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.560]   probably not. No, you can't." Some would be probably very certain, "No, you can't," or,
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:56.480]   "Probably not," or it would be very unreliable. But the guys are testing it. And as I understand
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.600]   it, there are a couple of things that they are testing. First and foremost, it's that it's a
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.520]   little bit uncertain. Unless you've had an actual x-ray, I guess it would show you if the growth
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.640]   plates... Unless you've had a full x-ray that says definitively, "Your growth plates are certainly
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.960]   closed," then there's a bit of a wiggle room at the end of puberty as to how long a guy can grow.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.960]   There have been some people who stopped growing when they were 15 years old, and there are some
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.760]   people who were still growing at 25 without doing anything unusual. But the normal thing is by the
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.080]   time you're out of your teenage years, your growth plates are probably closing over.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:36.160]   So, there are a couple of things that guys are trying to do. Number one, they're trying to do
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:42.400]   everything possible with their hormones to do everything possible to try to get any growth that
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:49.440]   is left from a hormonal perspective. So, it's not uncommon that a teenage young man will go through
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:55.200]   and eat like junk and not exercise and not sleep, and all of a sudden he's 17 years old and he's
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.440]   super short, and he's like, "Well, maybe I could do something." So, if he cleans up his diet and
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.920]   he cleans up his sleep and cleans up his habits, then maybe he could still grow a little bit.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:10.160]   In theory, there's some interesting theories about possibly if hormonal changes were significant
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.040]   enough that maybe there would be some kind of change that could actually happen with the
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.920]   hormones. You see this with... There's been some documented medical cases of people who've had a
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:28.160]   dysfunction in their pituitary gland, and I think there was one guy I was reading about that went
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:35.440]   from like dwarfism to giantism based upon this change in his pituitary gland. So, I don't
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.880]   understand it enough, and I'm not interested enough to dig into it enough to understand it,
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:44.560]   but that would be kind of the hormonal aspect of it. And then a lot of them are also focusing
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.320]   on trying to say, "Is there something physical that we could do?" And this physicality to me
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:56.800]   makes sense, but it is hard work. And so, there are two elements to the physicality. The first
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:03.040]   one is basically stretching, and stretching doesn't seem to have the greatest long-term
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.640]   effect, but it's not nothing. So, as I understand it, our height changes based upon the work that
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.400]   gravity affects on our bodies. So, if you measure yourself in the morning, right after you get up,
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.480]   after you've been lying in a bed all night, then that's when you're going to be the absolute
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:25.440]   tallest. And then it's not uncommon to lose a not insignificant amount of height throughout the day
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:30.480]   so that at the end of the day, when gravity has been pulling you down, you are the shortest at
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.680]   that point in time. So, there's people that are experimenting with various things to stretch
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:42.720]   themselves out, and they do hanging on a bar and stretch out and decompress their spine. And
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:47.040]   sometimes they hang upside down using something like gravity boots or an inversion table.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.680]   And that kind of stretching activity does seem to have some impact on height, but it doesn't seem
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.760]   to be anything that is long-lasting or permanent. It's basically just stretching out all the
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.720]   ligaments and the vertebrae and the bones. And that's probably not a bad thing, just like—by
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:06.000]   the way, I didn't even talk about fixing posture—but you can fix your posture and express
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.600]   yourself as a taller person. The more long-lasting thing would be to say, "Can you grow the bones?"
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.760]   And this is what some of the bros are trying to test. There's some documented history. There was
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:23.200]   a Russian guy who was a high jumper that grew when he was in his 20s because he wanted to be a better
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:30.400]   high jumper. And one of the things that he pioneered was basically he slept with—he set up
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:38.640]   a system of like an elastic band bed, and while he was sleeping, he would have these bands stretch
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:46.000]   him. And this, in addition to basically law of attraction exercises where he just visualized
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.040]   himself growing taller, he was able to allegedly, documentedly, extend his height by several inches
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:59.440]   from this. And so what the bros are trying to do is to test this and say, "If we get a lot of high
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:05.280]   impact activity for our bones, which creates small micro fractures in the bone," again, as I said
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.960]   earlier, that's analogous to the small micro tears of a muscle when you're exercising, "and then we
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.000]   sleep or we spend significant amounts of time in kind of a stretched-out position,
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:22.000]   then as our bones grow, they regrow and they rebuild the basic bone material
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.720]   in a stretched-out way. And could this help us to lengthen our bones, lengthen the bones of our legs
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:33.120]   so that we are actually taller?" And there's people that are claiming to get that experience.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.080]   They're documenting it. I don't know how true it is. It's just interesting to observe.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:44.400]   I find it fascinating from a purely scientific perspective to see people informing themselves,
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   see us sharing research around the world, and then seeing people documenting their experiments.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.800]   That's what I love about bro science. On the whole, it sounds like an enormous hassle,
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.240]   sounds very painful, and it sounds kind of weird to be that obsessed with height
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:03.360]   beyond that perspective. I think that one of the negative things about height is that this can
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:09.120]   become such a big thing in guys' minds. And instead of just embracing however tall you actually are
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:16.800]   and enhancing yourself with other characteristics, then the guys sit around and become depressed
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:24.640]   because they're not six feet tall. And I have a real bone to pick with people that emphasize this.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.440]   And I feel like a lot of the bros and kind of the red pillars and things like this are spending so
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.600]   much time on height, talking about how, "Well, you've got to be six feet tall," or, "You've got
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.280]   to have a certain height, and that's going to make everything easy." And in so doing,
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:44.160]   it could cause a young and impressionable and vulnerable young man to think that's somehow
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:50.400]   going to change everything. But I know lots of short guys who are extraordinarily competent,
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:55.920]   extremely successful, married to beautiful women, have great lives, are very highly respected,
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.880]   and they've done it all though being short. And interestingly, I've spent some time talking with
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.960]   some men in this situation. And in the same way that I'm glad that I'm tall,
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.880]   because that was my experience, they've expressed to me that they're glad that they're short,
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:15.280]   because being short and having to deal with the discrimination that they faced as short men
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:26.160]   caused them to become stronger and to adapt for that height restriction, for being short,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.280]   with other character qualities and other things that were ultimately quite effective for them.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.600]   And so I think that one of the things that really bothers me when I spend time
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:42.480]   listening to these guys and reading the comments is that some people think that somehow being tall
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.840]   is a magic formula that is going to lead to your automatically being successful in life.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:56.080]   And I can tell you as a tall man, it ain't that way. I'm glad that I'm tall. I acknowledge that
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:03.200]   it has helped me in many ways and is a great benefit, but it's not some kind of unilateral
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.840]   cheat code that fixes everything. You still got to develop a whole bunch of other stuff. So
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.280]   if you do the stuff that I've recommended and you still wind up being shorter than you would hope to
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:20.160]   be, don't even worry about it. Press on and do the best you can. My hope in today's podcast,
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.680]   again, as I said, very esoteric. Here's one of those factors that is genuinely a true factor.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.480]   I think you can help your children especially to do this. And I think that this should be one of
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.760]   those areas in which the reason you get rich is so you can spend more money on food. And that's
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:40.560]   kind of the closing point I want to make to you, is that sometimes people spend so much time
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.880]   piling up money and you're still eating rice and beans because, "Well, we're not going to spend
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:52.160]   more than 21% of our household income," and your kids are starving because they're eating rice and
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.160]   beans. And I want to shake you and say, "Bro, go buy some steaks." Throughout history, one of the
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:04.400]   great benefits of being wealthy has been to be able to afford higher quality food and enough
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.280]   of it. Throughout history, most of our ancestors have gone through their lives basically starved,
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:16.640]   starved both of calories and of nutrition. Good food costs more than cheap food. I am grateful
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:24.880]   that we can stay alive and get enough calories to be okay very, very cheaply today, but good food is
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:30.640]   still going to cost you money. And so, you should embrace the fact that you can afford better
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.760]   groceries and you can afford higher quality food. And this is quite literally something that you're
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.840]   building an inheritance in for your family, for your future, and for your future health,
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:47.840]   and for your children, your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren. You have the ability,
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.560]   not only prior to conception of your children, but you have the ability to affect the epigenetic
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.840]   future of your children. And so, feeding your children the best quality food that you can
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:05.920]   afford and the best quality food that you can find should be a high priority for your wealth.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.520]   And it's interesting. You see this in a lot of people. There was a video that was going around
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.360]   Twitter, sorry, picture, I don't know, six months, 10 months ago, something like that.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:21.680]   And it was a picture side-by-side of Bear Grylls' son, Marmaduke, and Donald Trump's son,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:27.200]   Barron Trump. And it was funny because you had these graduation pictures of Bear Grylls and his
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:36.080]   wife and their son, Marmaduke, who's just towering over his father. And then you had Barron Trump
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.680]   towering over Donald and Melania Trump. And this is exactly what my pictures with my parents look
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.840]   like. This is what we should look for as fathers and as mothers, is we want our children to be a
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.600]   few inches higher than we are. And then we want our grandchildren to wind up being a few inches
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:59.920]   higher than our children are. And we want to express and continue to grow to the ability that
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:07.440]   we're able to because all of the things that lead to height also lead to health, also lead to better
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.800]   cognitive performance, lead to all of the other things. Remember that it's not necessarily the
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:20.640]   case that height is some kind of social cheat code that is the thing that makes you successful.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:26.000]   It's not all discrimination. Let me read you the abstract. Here's this from a paper
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.800]   that was published by researchers Anne Case and Christina Paxson. The paper is called
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.040]   "Stature and Status, Height, Ability, and Labor Market Outcomes." Let me just read you,
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.160]   published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in August of 2006. Here's the abstract.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.760]   "It has long been recognized that taller adults hold jobs of higher status and on average earn
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.880]   more than other workers. A large number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:56.240]   the association between height and earnings. In developed countries, researchers have emphasized
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.920]   factors such as self-esteem, social dominance, and discrimination. In this paper, we offer a
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.920]   simpler explanation. On average, taller people earn more because they're smarter. As early as
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:13.680]   age three, before schooling has had a chance to play a role, and throughout childhood, taller
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:19.600]   children perform significantly better on cognitive tests. The correlation between height in childhood
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:25.120]   and adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women, so that tall children are much more
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.720]   likely to become tall adults. As adults, taller individuals are more likely to select into higher
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:36.720]   paying occupations that require more advanced verbal and numerical skills and greater intelligence
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:42.240]   for which they earn handsome returns. Using four datasets from the US and the UK, we find that the
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:48.800]   height premium in adult earnings can be explained by childhood scores on cognitive tests. Furthermore,
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.840]   we show that taller adults select into occupations that have higher cognitive skill requirements
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:01.360]   and lower physical skill demands. So if this paper is true in terms of the author's
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:08.640]   research outcomes, then the basic point of height is just to use it as an external marker
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:15.840]   for what I'm going to call health. A healthy body is going to grow to its genetic potential,
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:24.720]   and height and health also produce high cognitive ability or intelligence. So height is just an
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:32.080]   external thing that we can see of the internal processes. And this is basically the same thing
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:39.520]   with regard to beauty, that beauty is an outward indicator, generally, of health. So if we look at
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.160]   it in that terms, then you don't have to think, "Well, Joshua's just trying to paint some weird
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:51.120]   picture where we're trying to be high so we can get the girls." I'm saying that what you do to
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.240]   create good health, all those things I said of abundant food, of the highest quality,
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.720]   lots of protein, lots of high-quality animal proteins, lots of sleep, and lots of exercise,
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.840]   these are the things that our bodies need to actually create physical health through all of
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.640]   the natural processes that it already is doing. You probably don't need to supplement with all
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.480]   that stuff. Your body's just doing that stuff naturally with adequate and good sources of
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:23.360]   nutrition. So it's just a natural flow-together factor. But by pulling it apart in this way and
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:29.200]   talking about the component factors, I hope that I can encourage you to, most importantly,
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.520]   buy good quality food for your children and eliminate junk food from your house and for you,
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:42.320]   and number two, encourage a good sleep environment for your family, both for yourself and for your
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.080]   children. You got to fight for this. It's an epidemic for our teens and they're destroying
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:52.720]   their lives. And these things will lead to good hormonal regulation, lead to higher testosterone
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:58.080]   levels, better HGH production. And then we combine that with lots of activity, which again has all
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:03.440]   those hormonal effects and creates a healthy body, then we're putting in place a good foundation.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.280]   And whether it's a good foundation to earn more or just spend less money on healthcare,
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:14.080]   this is absolutely a solid personal finance topic. Hope you've enjoyed the show. Esoteric?
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:23.200]   Yes. Interesting? I hope so. I love weird trails like this. I love it. I hope you've enjoyed my
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:29.360]   narration of it. I refer you to the bros for more discussion, but on the whole, just do those things
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.960]   that I said that we know work and then let the bros keep on experimenting. I think it's super fun
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:41.520]   to see what they wind up with in the coming years and build a genetic heritage for your great,
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.840]   great grandchildren. Use your money to do that. Thanks for listening. I'll be back with you very
