[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Well, God gives each of us a different blend of skills and inclinations, certain instincts,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.560]   mental capacities, emotional strengths, tastes, et cetera.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.520]   So how do I know what role I'm supposed to play with my own set of gifts?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.080]   It's a perennial question, and today it comes from a college student named Sandra.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.120]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.240]   My name is Sandra, a junior at Ohio State University.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.880]   Thank you for this podcast and for your eagerness to hear from college students.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.880]   I have been saved for about a decade, and I love Christ.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.480]   In books I read and in conferences I attend, it seems more and more that I am being told
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.520]   to understand God's calling over me and my life, and I would sure love to know it, but
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.120]   I struggle here.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.880]   Maybe I will go into business, maybe a mom caring for a home, maybe even a missionary.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.320]   It would be helpful to know what God has for me, but I don't even know where to begin this
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.680]   process other than to pray.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.600]   How can I discover God's calling over my life, Pastor John?
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.520]   Where do I even begin?"
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.120]   The question will never grow old, because generation after generation must answer it,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.440]   and it is rarely easy to answer.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.000]   So thank you, Sandra, for the chance to dig back into some of these great biblical truths.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.280]   In fact, I find myself praying here at the front end of this question that God would
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.360]   use it to make hundreds of people find His precise, glorious, wonderful service.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.180]   Now it may be obvious to you, but I'm sure it's not to everyone, so I'm going to distinguish
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.920]   three kinds of calling.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:53.160]   First, the kind of calling that God speaks to us when we are dead in sins, and the calling,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.960]   that calling which brings us out of that deadness into life in union with Christ.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.360]   This is the calling in 1 Corinthians 1:22, "For Jews demand signs, Greeks seek wisdom,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.000]   but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.200]   those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   God."
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.360]   Millions of people come under the hearing of the general call of God in the preaching
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.880]   of the gospel.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.440]   But Paul says some among those millions regard this message as foolishness.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.520]   Some regard it as a stumbling block, but some experience through it, through that general
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:48.760]   call, they experience a divine inner call of God that causes them to say, "Christ crucified
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.400]   is the wisdom of God.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.800]   Christ crucified is the power of God."
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.920]   And they embrace it, and they are saved.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.720]   All Christians are called in this sense.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.080]   We were made Christians by the sovereign call of God that brought us from death to life.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.520]   Second, there's another kind of calling that we have in lifelong covenants that we make
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.680]   under God, and the main one that the Bible ordains is the covenant of marriage.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:30.320]   When God joins two people together in covenant in this way, namely on the analogy of Christ
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.040]   and his covenant with the church in Ephesians 5, when God joins a man and a woman in Ephesians
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.760]   5 like that, then Jesus said that God has joined them together in such a way that no
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.180]   man may put this asunder.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.960]   So the calling that we have in marriage is unlike the calling that we have to any particular
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.640]   vocation.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.520]   When you take a job, you're not forming a lifelong covenant under God.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:12.280]   You can change jobs, but when you marry, your calling is "Till death do us part."
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.480]   So that's a second kind of calling, not like the third kind I'm going to talk about now,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.680]   which is really the kind you're asking about.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   The third kind of calling is the process.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.840]   I'm saying this call of God is a process by which God leads his children into fruitful
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   positions of service, whether in the church or in the marketplace or in the home.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:50.560]   The way we hear this kind of calling is to be attentive to six ways that God acts on
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.040]   our behalf to bring us into a fruitful position of service in the world, not necessarily one
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.940]   that we'll have for 50 years.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.320]   We might experience movement as God's call moves, but the next one, and that's what Sandra
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   is asking about.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.400]   What's the next one that might be a lifelong calling or might be a 10-year calling?
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   We'll see.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.040]   So here are these six things, and I'll just say them very briefly because she said, "I
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.240]   don't know where to begin except for praying," and well, praying is one of my six.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.820]   And so here's five more for you to focus on.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.920]   Number one, God gives us in the Scriptures a worldview with Christ at the center and
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.520]   reveals to us that certain vocations and certain industries or certain ways of running industries
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.880]   are good and others are bad.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.680]   And when it's not crystal clear what's good and bad, He shows us that certain paths of
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.040]   service are more helpful or less helpful in the world, more hurtful or less hurtful in
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   the world.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:08.360]   And in showing us this, He works to keep us out of callings that would be evil or hurtful
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.560]   or unhelpful in the world.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.960]   So not every vocation is open to the follower of Christ, and that's a very important point
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.240]   of guidance that God gives us.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:29.600]   Number two, God has spoken in His Word to show us both what true need is in the world
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:38.640]   and what the world really needs, and He has acted to incline us, His people, to lean into
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.880]   those needs rather than thinking only of our private security and comfort and wealth and
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.440]   ease as though that should guide us in our vocation.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:57.000]   He has said, "Love your neighbor as yourself," and He has made us aware of how to define
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.960]   human need, and He has given us eyes and ears to discern where those needs are.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:13.120]   So part of His acting to guide us is to incline us away from selfishness toward need-meeting
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.400]   and then show us the real needs of the world.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:25.280]   Third, God has acted in every Christian to grant them various abilities, or we could
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.840]   call them gifts.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.480]   Listen to the way Paul speaks about this, because if you do, you'll get a flavor of
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.080]   what I'm talking about, because I'm not just talking about something that you might say,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.400]   "Oh, that's just spiritual and belongs in the church."
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.840]   Here's what he says in Romans 12.6, "Having gifts that differ according to the grace given
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.680]   to us," differing grace, "let us use them.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:59.560]   Give service in our serving, the one who teaches in his teaching, the one who exhorts in his
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:07.680]   exhortation, the one who contributes with generosity, the one who leads with zeal, the
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.720]   one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness."
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:18.000]   Now those last three should cause us to sit up and take notice that gifts have application
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.800]   to both life in Christian community and life in ordinary human relationships in the marketplace—contributing,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.340]   leading, mercy.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:37.360]   And my only point here is that we all have different inclinations, intuitions, different
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.040]   instincts, different skills, different mental capacities, different emotional strengths,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.260]   different tastes, different capacities for stress and endurance, different capacities
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.640]   for crowds and solitude, and on and on and on.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:59.160]   Oh, how different God has made us, which means that he has designed us to be more effective
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   at some things than at other things, and more at home in doing some things rather than other
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   things.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.840]   And mentioning being at home, I don't mean to absolutize that, that we should only do
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.640]   what we feel at home doing.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.440]   I think that's a big mistake lots of young people are making today.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.800]   They're saying, "I'm only going to do what perfectly suits my gifts.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.120]   I'm only going to do what perfectly fits my inclinations.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:32.600]   I'm only going to do what makes me feel really fulfilled, because it fits like a glove
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.200]   on my individual hand."
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:43.880]   Well, there have been many times in history when people, in order to stay alive or in
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:51.280]   order to do much good, had to do many things they did not feel suited to do because they
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.800]   needed to be done.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:01.000]   Nevertheless, I'll back up and say, in a world where choices are many—and that's
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.840]   pretty true in the West—God's gifting becomes a more significant part of God's
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.840]   calling.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:19.560]   Number four, God has put in our lives wise counselors and has ordained in His Word that
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:26.320]   we listen to them carefully about everything in this list of works of God.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.520]   One of the real needs around us is that we listen to counselors.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:41.060]   This is Proverbs 11:14, "Where there is no guidance, a people falls; but in an abundance
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.840]   of counselors there is safety."
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.960]   So we don't act in a vacuum.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.840]   Don't try to find God's will for your life in a vacuum.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.600]   We are part of a community of wisdom and love.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.400]   Number five, God has given us the gift of prayer.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.080]   "Pray wisely for the purpose of becoming wiser in the choices we make.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.320]   If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.440]   and it will be given him."
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.800]   So we pray over every one of these points day in and day out.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.120]   I still do this at age 72.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:26.640]   I pray, "God, don't let me make choices about what I do that would waste my life or what's
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   left of it."
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:34.360]   Lastly, number six, and this one's a little controversial because it's the most subjective,
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.080]   but I would say that God, through all these things, and that's important, through all
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:46.960]   those five things, and then by His Spirit, more subjectively, works in our minds and
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:55.640]   hearts to produce recurring, strong desires for a certain kind of service in the church
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.600]   or in the marketplace, which are very significant.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:10.960]   These desires are very significant in guiding us when they occur in our holiest moments.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:19.240]   So yes, I'm saying that your desires are a very significant means by which God acts on
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.160]   your behalf to give you the guidance you need into the service where you belong.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.880]   And I'm saying that those desires have three characteristics about them when they're most
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.880]   reliable.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.720]   One, they're recurrent.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.760]   They're not a flash in the pan.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.440]   They come back again and again and again.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.640]   Number two, they're strong.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.400]   They're not passing and weak and insignificant like changing tastes.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:52.440]   And most importantly, number three, these desires are not desires that are awakened
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:59.600]   while you're walking in sin, feeling distant from God, not enjoying worship, not spending
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.920]   time in the Word, not active in serving others.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.040]   No, no, no.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.680]   Desires that happen during those times are probably not very reliable at all.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:16.320]   Paul said, "This is the will of God, your holiness."
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.760]   First Thessalonians 4.3.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.160]   Students used to ask me, "How can I know the will of God?"
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.720]   And I'd say, "I know exactly what the will of God is for your life.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.480]   Holiness, period.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.940]   That's the will of God."
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:38.560]   And if holiness is God's will for you, it is safe to say that desires produced by holiness
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.280]   are significant for your guidance.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.360]   So there they are.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.580]   Number one, what kinds of service are good and beneficial?
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.540]   Number two, what are the needs of the world, the true needs?
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.080]   Number three, what has God gifted me to be more or less fruitful at?
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.240]   Number four, what is the counsel I receive from godly people?
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.440]   Number five, am I covering all of this in constant prayer for wisdom?
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:13.720]   And number six, what are my recurring, strong, holy desires?
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.400]   Such important connection to hear about holiness and our personal desires and God's will, which
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.080]   all stem, of course, from that incredible text in Psalm 37.4.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:29.320]   "Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.400]   Godward delight births in us righteous desires to follow.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.000]   Really important connections here, Pastor John.
