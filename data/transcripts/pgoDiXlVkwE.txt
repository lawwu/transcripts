[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   1) Frisco, a listener writes in to ask this, "Hi Pastor John, I want to propose to my girlfriend
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.240]   and as I prepare for marriage, thoughts of my past mistakes come to mind. I think back
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.400]   to women I slept with before I was saved and mistakes I made with my current girlfriend
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.520]   who, Lord willing, I will marry. People often speak of the purity to be saved for marriage
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.080]   and how terrible it is to squander that. What truths do you have to share with a man or
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.760]   woman such as myself struggling with regret related to past sexual mistakes and their
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.280]   current consequences in the context of marriage and engagement?"
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.480]   I am real eager to address this. This is a real and huge issue, and it always has been
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:56.360]   because millions of people have been converted and will be converted to Christ out of a life
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:07.360]   of sin, not before a life of sin. That's normal. Evangelization of the world means we're rescuing
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.720]   people after they have done horrible things, not before. So he's not in an unusual or unique
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.160]   position. What shall we think about these previous sins or, probably in his case, serious
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:33.760]   sins committed after faith? So I think the main thing I want to say to Frisco is this.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:48.680]   Virginity is a precious gift that you cannot give to your fiancé, nor she you. That is
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:02:02.920]   a great sadness and a great loss, but there are gifts you can give her, and God will multiply
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.440]   those gifts so wonderfully that the loss will not be destructive. That's what I want to
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:21.080]   say. And here's what I mean. You said, Frisco, that you've heard people say, "Save yourself
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.880]   sexually for marriage, and it's a terrible thing to squander that." Well, I say, "Yes.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.560]   Yes, yes, that's exactly right. That's exactly what I think Paul and Jesus would counsel
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   any virgin." 1 Corinthians 6:18, "Flee fornication." Your body belongs to God as a single person,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.880]   and it will belong to your future spouse. It would be good to think about this. 1 Corinthians
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.560]   7, "The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights." That means sex. "And likewise
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.600]   the wife her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.400]   husband does. Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.720]   wife does." In other words, you belong to each other, to no one else. You belong to
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   God in your singleness, united to him in your body by the Spirit, and in marriage you belong
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:29.080]   to God through union with your spouse as well. That is a precious biblical gift that should
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:38.400]   be presented in marriage, and that's a gift you don't have to give. And you will want
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.040]   to teach your children to have it. So what's the gift you do have to give to this fiancé
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.960]   with whom you've had sexual relations? What gift can you give her that God might be pleased
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:03.240]   to make so wonderful, the gift you can't give her will not destroy? And here it is. The
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:12.560]   gift you can give is this. You can look her fiancé in the eye and say, "I failed you.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:25.640]   I failed God, and I am deeply, deeply sorry. I hate what I did. I hate the hurt it caused
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:34.840]   you and me. I hate the dishonor that I brought upon the Lord. I hate the disrespect I showed
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:46.080]   you in not caring for you better. And I repent. I turn away from that sin and sinful forces
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:55.200]   that drove it. I renounce them, and I turn to Jesus Christ, my Lord and my Redeemer,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.400]   and I receive from him his full and blood-bought forgiveness, and I cherish it with all my
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:10.480]   heart. I tremble at the thought of despising his blood now. And by the Spirit that he has
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.600]   given me, I resolve in his strength never, never, never, never to betray him or to give
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:26.320]   my body to any woman but to my wife. I offer you my forgiven, redeemed, cleansed soul and
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:36.000]   body in marriage to cherish you and honor you and be faithful to you. I invite you into
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.480]   this new, forgiven, redeemed, cleansed union with me. I know there will always be scars
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:54.840]   and the memories, but God is merciful, and in his time and his wisdom and his way, he
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:04.960]   will make these scars of sin the emblem of his mercy and the signs of his cross. That's
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:15.400]   the gift, Risco, that you can give as a wonderful gift to your fiancée. And I pray that God
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.480]   will seal that gift for both of you.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.240]   Wonderful. Thank you for that, Pastor John. And in the past on the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.920]   we've addressed the question of how far is too far before marriage. And we have two episodes,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.800]   two of our most popular episodes ever, and they're titled, "How Far is Too Far Before
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.600]   Marriage?" That's episode 73. And "How Far is Too Far Before Marriage Spiritually and
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.840]   Emotionally?" That's episode number 84. So episodes number 73 and 84, be sure to check
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.160]   those out. Tomorrow, we address the topic of same-sex attraction and battling homosexual
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.680]   lust. Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   podcast.
