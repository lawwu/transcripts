[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   Pastor John, if one of your family members invited you to their so-called
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.160]   same-sex marriage ceremony, would you attend it? Just contemplating that
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:27.200]   thought is heartbreaking. My answer is no, I wouldn't, and that would be a kind of
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.560]   shattering of the cornerstone of a father's broken heart at that moment.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.720]   And here's why. I assume that's what they really want to know, not just
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.120]   whether I'd go or not, but why? Why wouldn't you? Number one, it's not a
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.840]   wedding because it's not a marriage, and therefore attending it as a wedding is
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:03.320]   to be false, like everyone there is being false. There is no such thing as a so-
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.160]   called same-sex marriage. God has defined marriage as a covenantal union for life
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.920]   between a man and a woman, as husband and wife. This isn't that, therefore this is
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.240]   not a marriage, and this is not a wedding. I'm not gonna lie about it by going.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.800]   Number two, this union, if you can dare to call it that, is not being joined in heaven.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.880]   Jesus said, "What God has joined together, let no man separate." This is what makes
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.960]   weddings awesome. They're not human accomplishments. God joins a man and a
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.400]   woman. Marriage is made in heaven, Jesus said, not between two people merely, or a
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.120]   pastor, or a judge, and this pairing of two men or two women is not being joined
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.360]   in heaven, and to give the impression that it is is an offense to heaven.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:18.440]   Number three, this blessing of this event would be hateful. It would be hateful for
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.360]   me to do it, because it would be confirming a life and a lifestyle that
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   will lead to hell. The Apostle Paul said, "Don't be deceived. Neither the
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.800]   sexually immoral, or idolaters, or adulterers, or men who practice
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.960]   homosexuality, or thieves, or greedy, or drunkards, or revilers, or swindlers, will
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.160]   inherit the kingdom of God." They won't. So to celebrate this lifestyle is to
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.320]   celebrate the destruction of human beings, and that's hateful. It would be
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.400]   like gathering to celebrate theft, gathering to celebrate drunkenness,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.560]   gathering to celebrate swindling. Let's all have a meeting and celebrate greed.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.400]   Let's all have a meeting and celebrate adultery. Anybody that joins in
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:23.600]   celebrating sin is sinning. I shouldn't sin. The fourth thing I would say is that
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.240]   this ceremony will defile the drama of Christ and the church. God designed
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.400]   marriage to display Christ's covenant to his bride, the church, to celebrate a
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.080]   brideless union as marriage is to distort and deface the parable of the
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.200]   most beautiful act in the world. And fifth, I wouldn't go because the weight
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.840]   of sorrow and love and revulsion would probably overwhelm me. I don't think I
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.600]   could probably get through the ceremony. And the last thing I would say is my
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:17.120]   not going is not my drawing away from my child, but his drawing away from me. I am
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.920]   where I have always been, arms wide open to the homecoming prodigal, ready to
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.480]   forgive anything. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this
