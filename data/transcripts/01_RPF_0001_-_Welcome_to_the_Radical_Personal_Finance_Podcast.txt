[00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.920]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 1.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.120]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.620]   Today's episode is simply going to be an introduction to the show.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.980]   I'd like to share with you my vision for the show, where I see it going,
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.280]   the type of content that I plan to produce for you, and some ideas.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.840]   I'd like to, at the end, ask you for some ideas.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.520]   Ultimately, I'm creating a podcast simply because I haven't been able to find one
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.500]   that fits the niche that I would be interested in.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.100]   So I warn you, first and foremost, if you choose to listen to my podcast,
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.280]   it's going to be a little bit off the wall.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.140]   Hopefully, the title is telling you everything that you need to know about radical personal
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.820]   finance.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.400]   But radical is a word that tends to describe my own personality a little bit.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.760]   I tend towards extremes, and we're going to get into some radical topics.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.040]   I personally would love to find a
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.680]   podcast, if it already existed, that gave me a ton of information, a ton of inspiration,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.080]   and simply didn't speak down to me.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.100]   I see a niche that is available in the personal finance world.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.100]   The personal finance world of financial advice, and financial magazines, and financial books,
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.860]   and radio shows, and TV shows is absolutely a huge world.
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.100]   Obviously, with CNBC, and
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.520]   Personal Finance, and Money Magazine, and Susie Orman, and Jim Cramer, and Dave Ramsey,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.280]   and all of these people, there are a lot of great people competing in this space.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.840]   When you add on to those people, the personal financial advisors from the big names, and
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.260]   the small names, and the financial planners, and the accountants, and the insurance agents,
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.860]   and all of the people that are working in this space, you would think that we would
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.160]   have a high personal financial literacy rate in this country, this country being the United
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.040]   States where I'm from.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.720]   And where I live.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.240]   Unfortunately, I don't perceive it to be so.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.060]   And I would like to do my part to help fix that.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.180]   Now, first, let me tell you kind of what my problems are with the personal finance world,
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.220]   and how I hope that I can be of help, and hope to fix it.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.360]   First and foremost, most of the personal finance world, in my opinion, seems to be largely focused
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.020]   on consumer-level personal finance.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.720]   finance. So that means that if somebody has a personal finance question, it has to be answered
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.200]   within five minutes on a radio show or on a TV show or sometimes two minutes or the most you'll
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.480]   get is maybe a five-page article on something in a money magazine. Ultimately, that type of
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.320]   financial, I don't know whether to call it advice or information, tends to fall short.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.880]   On the other hand, a lot of the really deep technical personal finance information is so
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.920]   complex and so technical that it's just simply boring, in my opinion, to read through and to
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.500]   look at. And yet that's kind of what you have to do. So if you have a finance question, if you have
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.580]   a tax question as an example, the first thing that you have to do is go to irs.gov and start wading
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.100]   through all of their publications. By the way, the IRS does actually, in my opinion, have some really
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.520]   good publications that are pretty clear. But you've got to do a lot of research. You've got to do a lot of
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   waiting. Forget it if you need to go to the actual tax code and start pulling together
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.360]   information from there. And thus we have the reality of massive armies of attorneys and
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:48.500]   people and judges and courts to interpret the law. I think that there's a need for an in-between
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.500]   source. I think there's a need for, I don't know what to call it, maybe introductory
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.660]   information, broad overview information. And there's also a desire for maybe a little bit
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:11.480]   deeper information. I'd love to learn that information, learn it with you, and share it
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:20.040]   with you in an audio format. I've got a challenge in front of me as far as learning how to communicate
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.480]   financial information that's compelling, that's accurate, and to do it,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.440]   in an audio format. Finance tends to be something, I think, that works best in a print format.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.180]   But number one, there's already a lot of really great resources in the print world.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.220]   And I'm not convinced that I can add a lot of value there.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.040]   Number two, however, is that in the day-to-day of our lives, I think that there is a
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.460]   little bit more access to audio information. You know, I, for one, in the past have spent a lot
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.020]   of time in the car, and I've always loved learning detailed audio information. You know, I spent
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.700]   thousands of dollars on CDs and seminars and audio books, and I love learning. And so I think that
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:18.320]   there is a need that's not being met in that world. And I'd like to do my part to help build that.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.440]   I'd like to help build financial literacy in this country. I think they went bankrupt a couple years
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.240]   ago, but the...
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.300]   Cy Sims, who was the founder of Sims Clothing Store, used to shop there when I was a kid.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.920]   And as a young adult, they had good deals on, I think, pants was what I usually bought there.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.460]   But they had as their corporate motto that an educated consumer is our best customer.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.920]   And I think that that's nowhere more true than in the financial space,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.900]   is that if you are financially literate and knowledgeable,
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.400]   and feel comfortable with the words, the topics, the decision points,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.580]   you can make a rational decision and make good, intelligent buying decisions.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:16.600]   One of my other beefs with the finance world, so to speak, is that it seems that many
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.960]   content providers tend to talk down to... Well, just be personal, talk down to me.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.800]   Uh, I can't...
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.060]   Can't quite handle listening to most, um, most finance, uh, people.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:38.100]   And the reason is because a lot of times they get their personal opinion confused with, uh,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.140]   fact and logic.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.600]   I've got this belief that ultimately all of us are probably pretty intelligent,
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.420]   and we're probably pretty rational.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.780]   And if we understand the pros and cons of various courses of action,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.580]   most of us are going to make a decision that...
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.800]   that is in our own best interest.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:04.120]   And that decision is going to be very personal to us.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.760]   There are very few rights and wrongs in the world of finance.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.780]   Even the things that might seem black and white seldom are.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.340]   And personally, I feel that what is needed is simply information.
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.360]   Uh, you know, if I'm going to make a buying decision or a, uh,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.440]   a saving or investment decision, all I want is the facts.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.940]   Give me the facts and then I'll look at my situation and I will be the one to...
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.940]   to consider what I'm trying to accomplish.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.240]   So, my goal with this show will be to simply present facts as I understand them,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.940]   um, and information that you can then use to make rational decisions
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.240]   about your specific situation.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.140]   I don't want to provide superficial or abstract financial information.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.140]   But I also don't want to go unnecessarily deep.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.140]   One of the things that I've thought about as far as how to talk about finance is that
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.140]   there's so many layers.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.140]   And, uh, this is my first podcast.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:12.140]   As you can probably tell, this is my first podcast and I'm not quite sure how I'm gonna,
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.140]   uh, accomplish all of...
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   I'm not sure how I'm going to accomplish appropriately dealing with each of the layers.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.920]   But I do have some ideas.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   I'm not sure how I'm going to, uh, accomplish all of...
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   I do have some ideas.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   Um, my plan is to produce some very simple shows that are appropriate for, you know, a sixth grader.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   Uh, or somebody just getting started with financial planning, uh, in their own lives.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   I'd also like to produce some more, maybe, moderate shows for...
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   for people who are, um, have a good grasp on the basics and want to go a little bit deeper.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:53.700]   And I also think it would be valuable to produce some extremely technical, very detailed shows that can be actually, uh,
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.700]   accessed on an archived basis for people who are looking for information that goes a little bit deeper.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:06.700]   Or trying to understand, um, understand, uh, what's right for their situation.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.700]   Money and personal finance, uh, are both...
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.700]   Money and personal finance is a topic that's both simple, but profoundly complex.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.480]   Simple in that the great truths are not gonna change from now on.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   They're gonna change from day to day.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   Uh, at the end of the day, here's my personal...
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.480]   Here's my...my own personal finance formula.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   Uh, make more than you spend, or spend less than you earn.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:46.480]   Take that difference, invest it wisely so that it grows for you, and repeat that process on an ongoing basis.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:53.260]   Protect yourself from the major risks that can happen, and think carefully about your own personal goals.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:10:00.260]   And apply rational common sense to your methods of achieving those personal goals.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.260]   Pretty simple.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.260]   I could probably make it even shorter and say, um, spend less than you earn and invest the difference wisely.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.260]   That's it.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:23.040]   But, on the same hand, we live, each and every one of us, governed by a tax code that is tens of thousands of pages long, um, with financial products that are marketed to us and, uh, are, uh, used to us.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   And bought by us each and every day that are profoundly complex.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:34.040]   Uh, we have investment opportunities that are, are, are deeply complicated.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.040]   And, uh, and it becomes overwhelming.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   Especially when those decisions are made in the context of an active, busy daily life.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   So, unfortunately, the topic can be neither simple nor complex.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.820]   It has to be a combination of both.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:59.820]   So, I envision, over the coming episodes, um, giving a lot of shows on philosophy.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.820]   You know, talking about different philosophies about money.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.820]   Uh, philosophies about personal finance.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.820]   Because, ultimately, philosophy, I think, drives a lot of our behavior.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.820]   I also envision digging into personal experiences.
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.820]   Uh, I hope to do many, many interviews with interesting people.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.820]   Um, my interests are widely varied.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.600]   Uh, I hope to do interviews with people who are homeless.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   Uh, out of work.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   Unemployed.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   Uh, on the ropes.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   I also hope to do interviews with people who are profoundly successful, both financially and otherwise.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   Because I believe that everybody has a story and everybody has something that they can teach us.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   Uh, I'd like to consult with experts.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   Um, I am not an expert.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   Let me say that again.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   I am not an expert.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   I'll share with you, uh, the best I've learned.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   But I'm gonna make mistakes along the way.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   Uh, it's gonna be up to you.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   Which I'll, uh, I'll give you the, probably some kind of legal disclaimer that's required in this space.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   And I'll give it to you at the end as far as my version of that.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   But, it's your money.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   No one else is gonna care about your money more than you care about your money.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   Uh, ultimately, it's your money.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   You're the one who has earned it.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   Been given it.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   Been trusted with the stewardship of it.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   Uh, you're the one who decides what you spend it on.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.600]   You're the one who decides what you invest it in.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   You're the one who decides how you handle it.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.600]   And you, we've got to take personal responsibility for our money in every way.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   So, my goal is to simply provide ideas.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   Ideas and information that you can then use to apply in your life.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   To meet your goals.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   Uh, ultimately over time, I'd love to create an archive.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   A vast audio archive of quality and, quality information that's practical.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   I'd love to create courses.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   You know, one of my own personal beefs is that,
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   we go through in this country years and years of school.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   But yet we don't spend a lot of time with all of the,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   we don't spend a lot of time learning financial literacy.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   Uh, going through high school and college,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.600]   I personally took maybe a half a year of a personal finance class.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   And at my high school, and that was in high school.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   Um, I've studied, you know, finance at the college level.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   But I've found that for the most part,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   those topics tend to be theoretical rather than practical.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   So, ultimately I'd like to create a,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   you know, strings of shows that would be appropriate for,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   um, elementary school students, high school students, college students,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   young adults, um, you know, advanced even.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   Um, so why me?
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   I don't feel qualified to do this podcast.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   Um, I wish somebody were doing it.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   But because I haven't been able to find somebody who would be able to do it,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   So, I'm going to be doing it.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   But because I haven't been able to find somebody else doing it,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   I've just decided to do it myself.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   So, if you can put up with my bumbling and my stutters and my stammers,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   we'll learn together.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   Uh, and we'll work towards creating,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.600]   creating that quality content.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   And I'm sure I'll get better with time.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   Um, I personally live by the fine, by the motto
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   that anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   Meaning that most people aren't truly excellent at, at, at something
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.600]   until they've done it for quite a while.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   Uh, in the past few years, Malcolm Gladwell, uh,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   the business author has popularized the 10,000 hour principle.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   Uh, others have written about it previously and since, but,
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   but he's the one who's brought it to the, the forefront of,
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   of our society recently, at least in my understanding.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   And the 10,000 hour principle basically says that
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.600]   it takes about 10,000 hours of focused dedication
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   to truly be a master at something.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   Uh, and I'm not a master at these subjects.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   Uh, I do have some education, but I'm not a master at these subjects.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   But, who knows, perhaps on episode 10,000
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   of the Radical Personal Finance podcast,
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   by then maybe we'll start getting good at this
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   and, and start being able to provide information that would be helpful.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   Uh, and, and be able to do it in a compelling manner.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   Uh, we're gonna dive deep.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   And we're gonna be radical.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   Um, Tim Ferriss, who's a, a popular author of, uh,
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   the 4-Hour Workweek, the 4-Hour Body, and his most recent book,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   The 4-Hour Chef, uh, I think I first heard it from him
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   and some of his concepts.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   He, he's a fan of studying the outliers.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   His, his claim to fame as far as some of his tricks that he uses
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   in his writings, or at least his contention is perhaps a better way of saying it,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   is that you can learn more by studying the outliers
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   than by the people in the middle.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   So if you have somebody, for, for a simple example,
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.600]   who's extremely short, and they are expert at,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   they're a highly compensated, very successful NBA player,
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   what makes them, what makes them, um, what makes them so good?
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   Uh, you know, it might on the surface seem obvious
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   as to why, uh, somebody who is seven feet tall and, and very large
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   is successful in the NBA, but what did the shorter person do
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   that was more effective?
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   Or what is the, on the other hand, I guess,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   what is the, uh, very large horse jockey do that makes,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   that's very successful make, do that makes him successful?
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   Uh, that by studying the outliers, uh, I think you learn, you learn a lot.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   So, I see going through the course of, of this personal, uh,
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.600]   Radical Personal Finance podcast, I'd like to study the outliers.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   What can we learn from somebody who's homeless and lives in their car
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   for six months or a year?
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   About their financial strategies?
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   Uh, what can we learn from people who have so much wealth
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   that they could not possibly, even if they tried, spend it all in their lifetime?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   Uh, what can we learn from people who pay, um, no income taxes?
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   And what can we learn from people who pay massive amounts of income taxes?
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   Uh, what can we learn from, from all of the outliers
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   and then the, the average quote unquote, um, ordinary people?
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   Uh, again, I'll endeavor to, I'll do my best to simply be a, a good host
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   and to be on this tour of curiosity with you.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   Um, I'll do my best to share with you information and ideas
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.600]   that I think are compelling and interesting.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   I'll do my best to be a good teacher of the things that I, uh,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   that I'm qualified to teach and to do, be a good student of the things that I need to learn.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   Uh, so that I can share them with you as a fellow student.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.600]   I won't talk down to you.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   I won't ever insult your intelligence.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   Uh, I'll point out things as I see them to be,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   but I'm never gonna talk down to you.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   Um, in a sense, that's the summary of my podcast.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   Um, that's where I hope to go.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.600]   Now again, I haven't done this before, so it's gonna be a learning process together.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   Very likely you're gonna wanna skip the first, I don't know, 500 or 1,000 episodes.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   Um, but I'm gonna do it, and I'm gonna consistently work at it with you,
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   and I'm gonna try to provide information that's going to make sense and be helpful to you.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   Uh, what I'd love to do is I'd love to hear from you
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   what kind of information would be most helpful to you.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   Here's some of my ideas.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   Number one, I love saving money.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   One of my biases is, uh, I'll state it right up front for you,
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   I'm a very frugal person in many things.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.600]   Uh, and I love saving money.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   Uh, part of my personal identity is, is frugality.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   And I enjoy that, and I enjoy talking about things that are gonna, uh, save money.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.600]   Now, this type of information is, is, is very temporary.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   Uh, it's, it's applicable on a, only on a timely basis.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   It'd be unusual if you were gonna go back to 1982
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   and listen to a, uh, an interview with somebody about how to save money on a personal computer.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   It'd be unusual if any of that information were relevant today.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   Um, to save money on a personal computer, you, you gotta do your new research practically every week.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   Um, even things, you know, that are more common, uh, have just changed dramatically.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   So, I love topics like that.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   I love to do shows on things like that, interview experts.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   That type of information is gonna be temporary.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.600]   Um, we'd like to talk about, um, topics such as tax planning.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   Um, there are a lot of real, there's a lot of really good basic information that, uh, consumers and citizens need to know about tax planning.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   Uh, tax planning would be one of those things where there may be some, some ongoing threads that are gonna be consistently true.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   But there are a lot of things that are gonna change year by year.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   So that would be a combination of overarching truths that don't change, but then each year the Internal Revenue Code is gonna change.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.600]   Uh, investment planning.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.600]   It's gonna change depending on, uh, where you're at.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   But yet there are gonna be some great truths of investing that, uh, that you might find are, are constant and, and, and never change.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   Um, one of my favorite, um, investors is, um, Sir John Templeton who founded the Templeton Funds.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   One of the greatest investors in my opinion of all time.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   Um, one of his quotes that I enjoy was some of the most dangerous words in investing loosely, this is loosely paraphrased.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   Some of the most, I think the, the four most dangerous words in investing are, are simply, "It's different this time."
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   Uh, the more things change, the more they tend to stay the same.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   I guess would be the other cliche that, that would apply, be applied to it.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   Um, there are some radically cool lifestyle changes that are available to people.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:29.600]   Whether it's, you know, popular topics such as geo-arbitrage, which is developing a flexi- the idea of developing a flexible lifestyle.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   That allows you to go and be where you want to and especially go and be in places where your money's gonna be stretched a little bit further than it is where you are from today.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   Um, the world is so open with so many opportunities.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   Uh, times are changing, uh, so fast.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   But that's a, means there's a world of opportunities and there's a, uh, tremendous options for really cool lifestyles that are available that have never been available.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   Um, the internet, in my opinion, has opened up contact with people that previously never would have been available.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   So today, we can, uh, speak and you and I probably will do this together in, in the form of interviews.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   We can speak with people from around the world that we never could have had contact with, you know, 30 years ago.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   And we can find out what works for them and what doesn't work for them.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   So the show is gonna be varied.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   My hope is to do this as a daily show.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   Uh, I'm not certain that I'll be able to maintain that schedule, but that would be my goal.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   Um, my hope is that this would be a resource for you that would allow you to make better decisions for yourself.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:50.600]   And that it would be a constant resource that would, would put information and inspiration that would be useful to you.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   Uh, I'll finish with two things.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   Number one is probably my qualifications.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   Um, oftentimes I'm interested in, in hearing people's qualifications.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   Why do they feel qualified to, um, to speak, to speak to me?
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   In a sense, there are two answers to this.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   There's the resume answer, which I'll come to in a moment, but I'll probably short circuit.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.600]   And then there's the reality answer.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   Uh, the reality answer is you're the one who's going to choose whether my qualifications are good or bad.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:30.320]   my qualifications are sufficient based upon, you know, the good job that I do. If I'm boring
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:37.820]   and uninteresting and, I guess, academic and you don't listen, well, no matter how smart
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:44.420]   I may be or no matter how widely read I may be, then it doesn't do you any good. On the
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.620]   other hand, I may be the most entertaining person, but if I don't have any grounding
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:53.720]   in the facts, well, I guess it's entertainment, which has some value, but it's not going to
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:24:00.840]   help you when you undergo an audit or when you find yourself contrary to some law or
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:07.220]   rule that you weren't aware of. So it's up to you to judge my qualifications. My first
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.840]   qualification I'd like you to judge me by would be the fact that I'm a student. I'm
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:17.440]   a learner, hopefully just like you. This podcast, I'm going to enjoy doing it even
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:17.600]   if not as much as I would like to do it. I'm going to enjoy doing it even if not as much
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:17.640]   as I would like to do it. I'm going to enjoy doing it even if not as much as I would like
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:17.640]   to do it. I'm going to enjoy doing it even if not as much as I would like to do it. I
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   don't have huge aspirations for this podcast as being a career for me or something that's
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.900]   going to make me millions of dollars, although, you know, obviously I'm open to that. I'm
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:42.420]   going to do this podcast for my own enjoyment, my own learning. I'm also going to do it
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.580]   in hopes of helping you. At the end of one's life, I think one of the things that I'm going
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:25:17.560]   to do is I'm going to do it in hopes of helping you. At the end of one's life, I think one of the
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:17.580]   things that I'm going to do is I'm going to do it in hopes of helping you. At the end of one's life, I think one of the
