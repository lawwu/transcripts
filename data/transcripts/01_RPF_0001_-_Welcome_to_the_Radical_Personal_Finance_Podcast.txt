[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   >> Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 1.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.400]   I'm your host, Josh Rascheitz.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.600]   Today's episode is simply going to be an introduction to the show.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.000]   I'd like to share with you my vision for the show, where I see it going, the type of content
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.280]   that I plan to produce for you, and some ideas.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.680]   I'd like to, at the end, ask you for some ideas.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.160]   Ultimately, I'm creating a podcast simply because I haven't been able to find one that
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.080]   fits the niche that I would be interested in.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.340]   So I warn you, first and foremost, if you choose to listen to my podcast, it's going
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.800]   to be a little bit off the wall.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.200]   Hopefully the title is telling you everything that you need to know about radical personal
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.960]   finance.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.800]   But radical is a word that tends to describe my own personality a little bit.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.120]   I tend towards extremes, and we're going to get into some radical topics.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.680]   I personally would love to find a podcast, if it already existed, that gave me a ton
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.920]   of information, a ton of inspiration, and simply didn't speak down to me.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.280]   I see a niche that is available in the personal finance world.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.120]   The personal finance world of financial advice and financial magazines and financial books
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.520]   and radio shows and TV shows is absolutely a huge world.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.600]   Obviously with CNBC and Personal Finance and Money Magazine and Suzy Orman and Jim Cramer
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.960]   and Dave Ramsey and all of these people, there are a lot of great people competing in this
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   space.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.840]   When you add on to those people the personal financial advisors from the big names and
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.320]   the small names and the financial planners and the accountants and the insurance agents
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.840]   and all of the people that are working in this space, you would think that we would
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.200]   have a high personal financial literacy rate in this country, this country being the United
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.120]   States where I'm from and where I live.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.960]   Unfortunately I don't perceive it to be so, and I would like to do my part to help fix
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   that.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.560]   Now first let me tell you kind of what my problems are with the personal finance world
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.920]   and how I hope that I can be of help and hope to fix it.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.480]   First and foremost, most of the personal finance world in my opinion seems to be largely focused
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   on consumer level personal finance.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.000]   So that means that if somebody has a personal finance question, it has to be answered within
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.120]   five minutes on a radio show or on a TV show or sometimes two minutes or the most you'll
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.400]   get is maybe a five-page article on something in a money magazine.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.440]   Ultimately that type of financial, I don't know whether to call it advice or information,
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.040]   tends to fall short.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.400]   On the other hand, a lot of the really deep technical personal finance information is
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.640]   so complex and so technical that it's just simply boring in my opinion to read through
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.200]   and to look at, and yet that's kind of what you have to do.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.280]   So if you have a finance question, if you have a tax question as an example, the first
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.360]   thing that you have to do is go to IRS.gov and start wading through all of their publications.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.200]   By the way, the IRS does actually in my opinion have some really good publications that are
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.560]   pretty clear, but you've got to do quite a bit of wading.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.140]   Forget it if you need to go to the actual tax code and start pulling together information
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.240]   from there.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.440]   Thus we have the reality of massive armies of attorneys and people and judges in courts
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.800]   to interpret the law.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.240]   I think that there's a need for an in-between source.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.200]   I think there's a need for, I don't know what to call it, maybe introductory information,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.440]   broad overview information, and there's also a desire for maybe a little bit deeper information.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.120]   I'd love to learn that information, learn it with you, and share it with you in an audio
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.400]   format.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.560]   I've got a challenge in front of me as far as learning how to communicate financial information
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   that's compelling, that's accurate, and to do it in an audio format.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.280]   Finance tends to be something I think that works best in a print format, but number one,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.680]   there's already a lot of really great resources in the print world, and I'm not convinced
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.880]   that I can add a lot of value there.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   Number two, however, is that in the day-to-day of our lives, I think that there is a little
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.840]   bit more access to audio information.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.640]   I, for one, in the past have spent a lot of time in the car, and I've always loved learning
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.120]   detailed audio information.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.960]   I've spent thousands of dollars on CDs and seminars and audio books, and I love learning.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.400]   So I think that there's a need that's not being met in that world, and I'd like to do
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.560]   my part to help build that.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.040]   I'd like to help build financial literacy in this country.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.920]   I think they went bankrupt a couple of years ago, but Cy Simms, who was the founder of
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.200]   Simms Clothing Store, used to shop there when I was a kid, and as a young adult they had
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.960]   good deals on, I think, pants was what I usually bought there.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.880]   But they had as their corporate motto that an educated consumer is our best customer,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.160]   and I think that that's nowhere more true than in the financial space, is that if you
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:59.240]   are financially literate and knowledgeable and feel comfortable with the words, the topics,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.120]   the decision points, you can make a rational decision and make good, intelligent buying
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   decisions.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:17.800]   One of my other beefs with the finance world, so to speak, is that it seems that many content
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.160]   providers tend to talk down to, just to be personal, talk down to me.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:32.680]   I can't quite handle listening to most finance people, and the reason is because a lot of
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:41.160]   times they get their personal opinion confused with fact and logic.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   I've got this belief that ultimately all of us are probably pretty intelligent and we're
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.520]   probably pretty rational, and if we understand the pros and cons of various courses of action,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.520]   most of us are going to make a decision that is in our own best interest.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:05.360]   And that decision is going to be very personal to us.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.840]   There are very few rights and wrongs in the world of finance.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.200]   Even the things that might seem black and white, seldom are.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.800]   And personally, I feel that what is needed is simply information.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.560]   You know, if I'm going to make a buying decision or a saving or investment decision, all I
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.200]   want is the facts.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.440]   Give me the facts and then I'll look at my situation and I will be the one to consider
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.720]   what I'm trying to accomplish.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:42.400]   So my goal with this show will be to simply present facts as I understand them, and information
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:50.160]   that you can then use to make rational decisions about your specific situation.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.240]   I don't want to provide superficial or abstract financial information, but I also don't want
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.280]   to go unnecessarily deep.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.760]   One of the things that I've thought about as far as how to talk about finance is that
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.160]   there's so many layers.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:11.280]   And this is my first podcast, as you can probably tell.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:19.100]   This is my first podcast and I'm not quite sure how I'm going to accomplish all of, not
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.680]   sure how I'm going to accomplish appropriately dealing with each of the layers.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.660]   But I do have some ideas.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.840]   My plan is to produce some very simple shows that are appropriate for, you know, a sixth
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.520]   grader or somebody just getting started with financial planning in their own lives.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.600]   I'd also like to produce some more maybe moderate shows for people who have a good grasp on
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.320]   the basics and want to go a little bit deeper.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.080]   And I also think it would be valuable to produce some extremely technical, very detailed shows
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.320]   that can be accessed on an archived basis for people who are looking for information
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:07.080]   that goes a little bit deeper or trying to understand what's right for their situation.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:13.940]   Money and personal finance are both, money and personal finance is a topic that's both
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:19.680]   simple but profoundly complex.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.640]   Simple in that the great truths are not going to change from day to day.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.800]   The end of the day, here's my personal, here's my own personal finance formula.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.680]   Make more than you spend or spend less than you earn.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:45.040]   Take that difference, invest it wisely so that it grows for you and repeat that process
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.880]   on an ongoing basis.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.920]   Protect yourself from the major risks that can happen and think carefully about your
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.200]   own personal goals and apply rational common sense to your methods of achieving those personal
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   goals.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200]   Pretty simple.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.120]   I could probably make it even shorter and say spend less than you earn and invest the
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   difference wisely.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.960]   That's it.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   But on the same hand, we live, each and every one of us, governed by a tax code that is
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:23.680]   tens of thousands of pages long with financial products that are marketed to us and bought
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.280]   by us each and every day that are profoundly complex.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:38.400]   We have investment opportunities that are deeply complicated and it becomes overwhelming
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:46.120]   especially when those decisions are made in the context of an active, busy daily life.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.320]   So unfortunately, the topic can be neither simple nor complex.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.080]   It has to be a combination of those.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:00.640]   So I envision over the coming episodes giving a lot of shows on philosophy, talking about
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.600]   different philosophies about money, philosophies about personal finance because ultimately
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.960]   philosophy I think drives a lot of our behavior.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.680]   Also envision digging into personal experiences.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.480]   I hope to do many, many interviews with interesting people.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.440]   My interests are widely varied.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.040]   I hope to do interviews with people who are homeless, out of work, unemployed, on the
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.040]   ropes.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.120]   I also hope to do interviews with people who are profoundly successful both financially
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.440]   and otherwise because I believe that everybody has a story and everybody has something that
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.080]   they can teach us.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.320]   I'd like to consult with experts.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   I am not an expert.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   Let me say that again.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.680]   I am not an expert.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.000]   I'll share with you the best I've learned but I'm going to make mistakes along the way.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.920]   It's going to be up to you which I'll give you probably some kind of legal disclaimer
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.760]   that's required in this space and I'll give it to you at the end as far as my version
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   of that.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.360]   But it's your money.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.780]   No one else is going to care about your money more than you care about your money.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.400]   Ultimately it's your money.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:18.640]   You're the one who has earned it, been given it, been trusted with the stewardship of it.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.700]   You're the one who decides what you spend it on.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.760]   You're the one who decides what you invest it in.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.640]   You're the one who decides how you handle it.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.920]   And we've got to take personal responsibility for our money in every way.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:40.960]   So my goal is to simply provide ideas, ideas and information that you can then use to apply
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.760]   in your life to meet your goals.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:58.400]   Over time I'd love to create an archive, a vast audio archive of quality information
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.800]   that's practical.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.720]   I'd love to create courses.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:11.680]   One of my own personal beefs is that we go through in this country years and years of
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:20.240]   school but yet we don't spend a lot of time with all of the – we don't spend a lot
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.840]   of time learning financial literacy.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.600]   Going through high school and college I personally took maybe a half a year of a personal finance
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.240]   class and that was in high school.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:40.920]   I studied finance at the college level but I found that for the most part those topics
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.360]   tend to be theoretical rather than practical.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:54.520]   So ultimately I'd like to create strings of shows that would be appropriate for elementary
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:03.440]   school students, high school students, college students, young adults, advanced even.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.840]   So why me?
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.800]   I don't feel qualified to do this podcast.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.040]   I wish somebody were doing it but because I haven't been able to find somebody else
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.460]   doing it I've just decided to do it myself.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:26.400]   So if you could put up with my bumbling and my stutters and my stammers we'll learn
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   together and we'll work towards creating that quality content and I'm sure I'll
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.600]   get better with time.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:44.480]   I personally live by the motto that anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:52.080]   meaning that most people aren't truly excellent at something until they've done it for quite
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080]   a while.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.320]   In the past few years Malcolm Gladwell, the business author, has popularized the 10,000
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.600]   hour principle.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.080]   Others have written about it previously and since but he's the one who's brought it
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.360]   to the forefront of our society recently at least in my understanding.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.920]   And the 10,000 hour principle basically says that it takes about 10,000 hours of focused
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.640]   dedication to truly be a master at something.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.040]   I'm not a master at these subjects.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.120]   I do have some education but I'm not a master of these subjects.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:31.080]   But who knows perhaps on episode 10,000 of the Radical Personal Finance Podcast by then
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.440]   maybe we'll start getting good at this and start being able to provide information that
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.720]   would be helpful and be able to do it in a compelling manner.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.320]   We're going to dive deep and we're going to be radical.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:51.840]   Tim Ferriss who's a popular author of the 4-hour work week, the 4-hour body and his
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.000]   most recent book the 4-hour chef.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.200]   I think I first heard it from him and some of his concepts.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.840]   He's a fan of studying the outliers.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:08.440]   His claim to fame as far as some of his tricks that he uses in his writings or at least his
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.080]   contention is perhaps a better way of saying it is that you can learn more by studying
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.880]   the outliers than by the people in the middle.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:23.280]   So if you have somebody for a simple example who's extremely short and they are highly
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:30.080]   compensated and a very successful NBA player, what makes them so good?
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.560]   It might on the surface seem obvious as to why somebody who is 7 feet tall and very large
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   is successful in the NBA but what did the shorter person do that was more effective?
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.240]   Or what is the – on the other hand I guess, what is the very large horse jockey do that
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.640]   makes – that's very successful do that makes him successful?
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.240]   By studying the outliers, I think you learn a lot.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:03.200]   So I see going through the course of this personal – Radical Personal Finance podcast,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.280]   I'd like to study the outliers.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.720]   What can we learn from somebody who's homeless and lives in their car for 6 months or a year
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.040]   about their financial strategies?
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:18.820]   What can we learn from people who have so much wealth that they could not possibly even
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.200]   if they tried spend it all in their lifetime?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:27.800]   What can we learn from people who pay no income taxes and what can we learn from people who
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.080]   pay massive amounts of income taxes?
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:39.000]   What can we learn from all of the outliers and then the average "ordinary people"?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.400]   Again, I'll endeavor to – I'll do my best to simply be a good host and to be on
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.000]   this tour of curiosity with you.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.520]   I'll do my best to share with you information and ideas that I think are compelling and
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   interesting.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.480]   I'll do my best to be a good teacher of the things that I – that I'm qualified
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.800]   to teach and to do – be a good student of the things that I need to learn so that I
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.200]   can share them with you as a fellow student.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.800]   I won't talk down to you.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.120]   I won't ever insult your intelligence.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:25.400]   I'll point out things as I see them to be but I'm never going to talk down to you.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.640]   In a sense, that's the summary of my podcast.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   That's where I hope to go.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.500]   Now again, I haven't done this before so it's going to be a learning process together.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:42.800]   Very likely you're going to want to skip the first, I don't know, 500 or 1,000 episodes
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.640]   but I'm going to do it and I'm going to consistently work at it with you and I'm
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   going to try to provide information that's going to make sense and be helpful to you.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.400]   What I'd love to do is I'd love to hear from you what kind of information would be
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.160]   most helpful to you.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   Here are some of my ideas.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.360]   Number one, I love saving money.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.480]   One of my biases is – I'll state it right up front for you – I'm a very frugal person
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.980]   in many things and I love saving money.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:17.440]   Part of my personal identity is frugality and I enjoy that and I enjoy talking about
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.960]   things that are going to save money.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.320]   Now this type of information is very temporary.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.200]   It's applicable only on a timely basis.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.720]   It would be unusual if you were going to go back to 1982 and listen to an interview with
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.960]   somebody about how to save money on a personal computer.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.240]   It would be unusual if any of that information were relevant today.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.840]   To save money on a personal computer you've got to do your new research practically every
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.880]   week.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.380]   Even things that are more common have just changed dramatically.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.120]   So I love topics like that.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.140]   I love to do shows on things like that, interview experts.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.040]   That type of information is going to be temporary.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.680]   We'd like to talk about topics such as tax planning.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:11.240]   There's a lot of really good basic information that consumers and citizens need to know about
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.920]   tax planning.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.720]   Tax planning will be one of those things where there may be some ongoing threads that are
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   going to be consistently true but there are a lot of things that are going to change year
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   by year.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:29.000]   So that would be a combination of overarching truths that don't change but then each year
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.840]   the Internal Revenue Code is going to change.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.800]   It's going to change depending on where you're at but yet there are going to be some great
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:45.580]   truths of investing that you might find are constant and never change.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:51.880]   One of my favorite investors is Sir John Templeton who founded the Templeton Funds.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.200]   One of the greatest investors in my opinion of all time.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.640]   One of his quotes that I enjoy was "Some of the most dangerous words in investing" this
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.520]   is loosely paraphrased.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.800]   Some of the most, I think the four most dangerous words in investing are simply "It's different
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.520]   this time."
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.280]   The more things change the more they tend to stay the same I guess would be the other
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.880]   cliche that would be applied to it.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.000]   There are some radically cool lifestyle changes that are available to people.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.600]   Whether it's popular topics such as geo-arbitrage which is developing a flex of the idea of
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.760]   developing a flexible lifestyle that allows you to go and be where you want to and especially
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.360]   go and be in places where your money is going to be stretched a little bit further than
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.200]   it is where you are from today.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.760]   The world is so open with so many opportunities.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:50.240]   Times are changing so fast but that means there's a world of opportunities and there's
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:57.920]   tremendous options for really cool lifestyles that are available that have never been available.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:04.120]   The internet in my opinion has opened up contact with people that previously never would have
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   been available.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:11.560]   So today we can speak and you and I probably will do this together in the form of interviews.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.920]   We can speak with people from around the world that we never could have had contact with
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.560]   30 years ago.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.080]   We can find out what works for them and what doesn't work for them.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.420]   So the show is going to be varied.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.760]   My hope is to do this as a daily show.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.320]   I'm not certain that I'll be able to maintain that schedule but that would be my goal.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:42.120]   My hope is that this would be a resource for you that would allow you to make better decisions
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.920]   for yourself and that it would be a constant resource that would put information and inspiration
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:54.040]   that would be useful to you.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.360]   I'll finish with two things.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.400]   Number one is probably my qualifications.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.680]   Oftentimes I'm interested in hearing people's qualifications.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:11.200]   Why do they feel qualified to speak to me?
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.320]   In a sense there are two answers to this.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.880]   There's the resume answer which I'll come to in a moment but I'll probably short circuit
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.200]   and then there's the reality answer.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.680]   The reality answer is you're the one who's going to choose whether my qualifications
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.560]   are sufficient based upon the good job that I do.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:37.240]   If I'm boring and uninteresting and I guess academic and you don't listen, well no matter
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:44.280]   how smart I may be or no matter how widely read I may be then it doesn't do you any good.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.840]   On the other hand I may be the most entertaining person but if I don't have any grounding in
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:53.680]   the facts, well I guess it's entertainment which has some value but it's not going to
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:24:00.760]   help you when you undergo an audit or when you find yourself contrary to some law or
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.760]   rule that you weren't aware of.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.960]   So it's up to you to judge my qualifications.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.720]   My first qualification I'd like you to judge me by would be the fact that I'm a student.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.520]   I'm a learner, hopefully just like you.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:21.200]   This podcast I'm going to enjoy doing it even if nobody ever listens to it.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:27.600]   I don't have huge aspirations for this podcast as being a career for me or something that's
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.800]   going to make me millions of dollars although obviously I'm open to that.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:40.240]   I'm going to do this podcast for my own enjoyment, my own learning.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.600]   I'm also going to do it in hopes of helping you.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.320]   At the end of one's life I think one is going to look back on their impact on the world
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.440]   and I feel that one thing that I enjoy doing more than many people do is I enjoy learning
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:02.480]   and I enjoy learning, combining and then diffusing information to others.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.360]   My personal friends in daily life probably get a little bit annoyed at me for doing that
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.960]   constantly with them but I do it anyway.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.200]   I try not to be annoying with it but I do it anyway.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.040]   Perhaps this podcast would be helpful to some of them.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.480]   So I'm hoping to be a student along with you.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.880]   I'll share with you what I've learned.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.840]   I'll correct the record, set the record straight when I'm wrong.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.520]   I guarantee I'll be wrong and I'll do my best to quickly in certain things and I'll do my
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.160]   best to quickly admit those wrongs and straighten them out.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.920]   This is going to be a learning process.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:43.380]   As far as my other qualifications, at some point in time I may go into them.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.280]   Very simply though, I've been interested in the topics of personal finance for a very
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.380]   long time.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:56.960]   I've read probably hundreds of books on the subjects and the principles of personal finance.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.560]   Some of them I've gained a lot from, some of them I've just simply learned what not
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.400]   to do from.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.480]   I've got a background and a history in the financial services industry.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:15.680]   I have some formal qualifications, some formal education achievements and things like that
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:23.120]   that are useful that would pretend to say that I know what I'm talking about.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.400]   I'm not going to emphasize those things.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.280]   Maybe at some point in the future that will change.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.640]   I could sit here and bloviate about how great I am but at the end of the day you're the
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.560]   one who judges.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.280]   So I'll do my best to provide good information.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.520]   I'll do my best to cite each and every source that I use.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.680]   I'll do my best to share with you where I've learned things if I'm able to so that you
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.000]   can check me out and you can do your own work.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.240]   What I'd love to hear from you is what would you like to learn about in finance?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.360]   What questions do you have?
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   Are they straightforward, simple questions, surface questions?
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.280]   Or are they maybe deep calculation questions, things like that?
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.040]   I'd love to learn what you'd like to learn about.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.920]   I've got a lot of interests and obviously those will be reflected in my episodes of
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.440]   this podcast here.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.960]   But ultimately more important than my interests are you, the audience.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:28.240]   And I'd like to be your fellow learner on the path towards the truth and the information
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.600]   that we need in life.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.960]   That's it for episode one.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.920]   I think that provides a good enough introduction.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.960]   Who knows, perhaps in the future I'll re-record an introductory episode as things kind of
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.440]   come more clear as far as exactly what this podcast is going to look and sound and work
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440]   like.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.840]   But for now this should at least give you an idea as to what I hope to achieve with
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   my show.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.240]   I'm going to insert here a legal disclaimer.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:05.680]   The topics of finance are heavily regulated and it's very challenging for people to give
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:18.760]   good information in a straightforward way but yet not run afoul of the laws and things
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.080]   in case they make a mistake.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.160]   Here's what I'm not ever going to do in a forum like this.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.640]   I'm never going to give financial advice.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.240]   I'm never going to give personal financial advice.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.360]   I'll give ideas, strategies, try to share the laws as I understand them.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.880]   But I'm a layperson.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.560]   I'm not an expert.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.880]   So don't take anything that I say as being something that you should run out and act
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.880]   immediately upon.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.280]   I'll try to give you information but at the end of the day it's your money and some random
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.920]   guy on the internet shouldn't be the source of what you do with your money.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.200]   You should take the information that I share with you and you should study it, learn it,
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   pick it apart.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.360]   Number one, show me where I'm wrong.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.920]   Number two, learn it for yourself so that you can take it in.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.640]   You should consult with your own qualified experts, people that have a duty to you.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:19.000]   Unlike some random guy on the internet recording a podcast, you should probably generally consult
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.480]   with professionals, people who know what they're doing and then have a legal and moral and
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.520]   ethical duty to you to give you solid information.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.280]   I'll do my best to give you good information but at the end of the day I'm a random guy
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.360]   on the internet.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:39.920]   I probably should at some point put forth some more definite legal disclaimer.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.000]   I hear it on the other shows and information.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.760]   So for now consider this entertainment and at the end of the day it's your money.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.320]   You should care about it more than anybody else does.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.520]   So take good care of it.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:01.680]   If you take care of it, money has a way of providing for you and being there when you
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   need it.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.240]   With that, this is Joshua Sheets.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Thanks for listening.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.440]   Again, I'd love to hear from you.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   Here's my email address.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.320]   Shoot me an email.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:15.400]   My email address is joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.680]   Again joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.960]   Shoot me an email.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.440]   Let me know how I can make the show be of service and of value to you.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.520]   Bye bye.
