[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Welcome back on this new week as we pick up with our third consecutive apologetics question
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.400]   on the person and work of Christ.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.520]   Started last week when we asked, "Even if the Christian faith is untrue, if the cross
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.980]   and resurrection didn't happen, aren't Christians still happier than non-Christians
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.980]   in this life?"
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.000]   That was ABJ 1977, followed by a look at six reasons why Jesus had to leave earth after
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Easter.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.280]   Imagine life on earth if Christ was still here with us.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.280]   Well, he's not.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.280]   Why not?
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.560]   That was last time in ABJ 1978.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.880]   That takes us to today.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.840]   If the consequences of our sin against the Holy God require eternal judgment, why did
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.960]   Christ suffer for no more than 33 years?
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.720]   Shouldn't his sufferings also be eternal, if that's what we deserve?
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.720]   Here are two emails.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.200]   My name is Glenn from San Jose.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.700]   Thank you for your ministry.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.560]   As with many people, ABJ has been a part of my regular routine and has blessed me and
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.600]   allows me to bless others in return.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.160]   That's awesome to hear.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.520]   I have a question for you about Jesus that I cannot answer for myself.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.500]   Namely, why did Jesus not spend eternity in hell if this was the awesome and holy price
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.720]   to be paid for sin?
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.720]   Does the Bible tell us why?
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.640]   And this is basically the same question from a listener named Floris.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.040]   Pastor John, can you explain why Jesus' payment for our sins was not eternal as it was for
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.880]   sinners?
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.000]   This is an excellent question because it pushes us to take seriously the worth of the death
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.800]   of Jesus, and we need to do that.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.600]   We don't ponder too often the greatness of the achievement of Christ in paying the debt
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.960]   for millions upon millions of hell-deserving sinners, like the thief on the cross, who
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.240]   before he was crucified had never done one single work of faith in his life, or like
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.200]   you and me, who may have known Jesus all our lives and have fallen short so many thousands
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.240]   of times we couldn't even begin to count them.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.680]   Our worship and our love for Christ ought to burn brightly when we contemplate that
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:41.560]   one man, one God-man, could endure enough in 33 years to provide a sufficient satisfaction
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.520]   in the justice of God for eternal salvation for so many wicked people.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.880]   This is why we will sing the song of the Lamb, the crucified Lamb, forever, not just the
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.560]   song of the risen King.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.800]   The song of the slaughtered Lamb will be sung forever and ever.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.240]   It was a staggering achievement on the cross.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.960]   So the question is, how is it possible?
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:22.320]   Jesus taught us that sinners like us deserve eternal punishment, Matthew 25, 46.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.360]   And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:37.560]   So the punishment for sin is as long as life is long for the saved, forever.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.000]   Paul said the same thing.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.260]   They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, 2 Thessalonians 1, 9.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:55.560]   So the question Glenn is asking is, if Christ bore our punishment, why then does he not
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.400]   have to endure the same punishment, namely eternal suffering?
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:10.080]   And make no mistake, those who trust in Christ are saved from eternal punishment because
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.480]   Christ bore our punishment for us.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.080]   Colossians 1, 14, "The record of debt against us God set aside, nailing it to the cross."
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.640]   That means through the hands of Jesus.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.240]   Galatians 3, 13, "Christ became a curse for us."
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.760]   Isaiah 53, 5, "He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities."
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.880]   1 Peter 2, 24, "He bore our sins in his body on the tree."
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.720]   Romans 8, 3, "By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, God
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.480]   condemned our sin in the flesh."
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.320]   Romans 10, 45, "He gave his life as a ransom for many."
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.160]   1 Corinthians 6, 20, "You were bought with a price."
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.080]   Acts 20, 28, "God obtained the church with his own blood."
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:15.480]   Christ achieved this substitution for millions of believers, not by suffering eternally in
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.400]   hell but by being obedient in suffering unto death, even death on a cross.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:34.040]   And the question is, how does he bear eternities of punishment in the space of 33 years of
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.640]   life?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.720]   How does his suffering suffice to cancel the punishment of millions of people who were
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.240]   bound to eternal punishment?
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.920]   Now the Bible does not say explicitly how this works.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:05.280]   But just as we learn the demerit of sin by looking at God's appointed penalty for it,
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:13.920]   namely eternal punishment, so also we learn the merit or the worth of Christ and his suffering
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.040]   by looking at the achievement of it, namely salvation for millions of hell-deserving sinners.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.240]   So the question becomes, what is it about the worth of Jesus and his suffering that
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.720]   makes it sufficient to remove the punishment of millions of sinners?
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.840]   Let me read you the answer given by Jonathan Edwards and then say a word about it.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.240]   This comes from a sermon he preached in 1729 entitled "The Sacrifice of Christ Acceptable."
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.440]   Here's what he says.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:07:01.000]   Though Christ's sufferings were only temporal, that is, not eternal, yet they were equivalent
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.840]   to our eternal sufferings by reason of the infinite dignity of his person.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:17.920]   His blood which he spilled, his life which he laid down, was an infinite price because
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   it was the blood of God, as it is expressly called in Acts 20, 28, the church of God which
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.600]   he hath purchased with his own blood.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:42.040]   His life was the life of that person that was the eternal Son of God, though it was
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.440]   the life of a human nature.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:55.360]   Now upon this account, the price offered was equivalent to the demerit of the sins of all
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:03.560]   mankind and his sufferings equivalent to the eternal sufferings of the whole world.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:11.440]   Now the principle behind that argument is that the greater the worth or the dignity
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:22.080]   or the honor of a person, the more insulting and dishonorable and shameful is the innocent
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:30.680]   suffering of that person, so that the suffering of the Son of God is a greater evil than the
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.780]   suffering of a sinful human.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:40.120]   And since the worth and the honor of the Son of God is an infinite worth and an infinite
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:49.840]   honor, therefore his suffering had an infinite worth, more than enough to be the punishment
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.680]   for finite human beings.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:02.680]   Or to say it one more way, when Christ descended from the position of equality with God, Philippians
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:12.600]   2, to the point of forsakenness by God on the cross in agony, that depth of descent
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:20.920]   was infinitely greater than the descent of any sinful human into the sufferings of hell,
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.680]   indeed all of them together.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:31.520]   So one way of answering the question, how does Christ's 33-year-long suffering cover
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:39.640]   the sins of millions of people who deserve eternal suffering, is because the infinite
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:47.880]   worth of his person makes his suffering of infinite worth and sufficient for the covering
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.920]   of all the sins of all his people.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:10:00.020]   So as I said at the beginning, our worship and our love for Christ ought to burn very
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:07.660]   brightly when we consider that one man, one God-man, could endure enough suffering to
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.000]   cover so many hell-deserving sins.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Amen.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.520]   God's own blood.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.000]   You can't really say it any more scandalously than Acts 20, 28 puts it.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, for helping us take seriously the worth of the death of Jesus
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.760]   today.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.320]   That is what makes such a question worth asking and answering in the first place, because
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.960]   we get to dwell on Christ's all-sufficient sacrifice for us.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.120]   Awesome.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.520]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:43.220]   If you have a hard question to ask Pastor John, email us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.860]   As you can tell, this is a season of some interesting apologetics questions, answering
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.120]   objections, hard questions.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.300]   And we have another one up.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.880]   Next time, this one.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.000]   Does God love us beyond loving himself in us?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.420]   Does God love us because he really loves us for us, or does he love us simply because
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.480]   he sees his own reflection in us, and he loves that reflection of himself and not really
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.980]   us?
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.420]   This is such a key question.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.560]   Actually it's part of nine related questions that I'm going to attempt to serve up to Pastor
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.680]   John in one single episode.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.280]   We're going to put him to work next time.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.600]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.080]   We'll see you on Thursday.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.580]   [END]
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.580]   1.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.580]   Is God's love for us beyond loving himself in us?
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.580]   2.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.580]   Is God's love for us beyond loving himself in us?
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.580]   3.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.580]   Is God's love for us beyond loving himself in us?
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.580]   4.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.580]   Is God's love for us beyond loving himself in us?
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.580]   5.
