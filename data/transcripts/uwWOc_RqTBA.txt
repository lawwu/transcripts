[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.880]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.100]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.620]   Recently, the Huberman Lab hosted a live event
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.940]   at the Beacon Theater in New York City.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.540]   The event was entitled The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.140]   and it consisted of a lecture
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.400]   followed by a question and answer session with the audience.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.940]   We wanted to make the recorded version
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.880]   of that question and answer session available to everybody,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.580]   regardless of who could attend.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.180]   So what follows is the question and answer period
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.700]   from The Brain-Body Contract live Huberman Lab event.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.200]   I want to be sure to thank the sponsors from that event.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.100]   They were Eight Sleep, which makes smart mattress covers
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.400]   with heating and cooling capacity.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.280]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.420]   about eight months ago,
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.740]   and it is completely transformed by sleep.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.620]   I sleep so much deeper.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.660]   I wake up far less during the middle of the night,
[00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.940]   if at all, and I wake up feeling far better than I ever have
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.260]   even after the same amount of sleep.
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.820]   In fact, I love my Eight Sleep so much that when I travel,
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.720]   now I'm quite bothered that Airbnbs and hotels
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.740]   don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers on them,
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.220]   and I've even shipped my Eight Sleep mattress cover out
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.420]   to meet me in the location that I arrived to
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.580]   so that I get the best possible sleep.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.660]   If you want to try Eight Sleep,
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.440]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.680]   to save up to $400 off their Sleep Fit Holiday bundle,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.040]   which includes their new pod three cover.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.320]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.940]   United Kingdom, select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.560]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.640]   I'd like to also thank our supplement partner, Momentus.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.760]   They make the very highest quality supplements.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.520]   They ship internationally,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.720]   and they've formulated supplements
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.840]   as single ingredient formulations
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.960]   that match what is discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   If you're interested in any of those supplements,
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320]   please go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.000]   And now without further ado,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.180]   the question and answer session from the live event
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.880]   held at the Beacon Theater in New York City.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.680]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.260]   [upbeat music]
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:19.140]   You've said before that stress can be good for us,
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.080]   but how do we know when it's too much?
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.480]   That's a good question.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.240]   And I should preface that by saying
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.440]   that there's some incredible work
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.440]   that was done by a colleague of mine, Dr. Alia Crum,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.900]   Ali is how she goes by, Dr. Ali Crum,
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.960]   who is a, she was a Division I athlete.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.840]   She has a, she's a tenured professor
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.680]   of psychology at Stanford.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   She's a licensed clinical psychologist.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.280]   Like every once in a while I look around at my colleagues,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.880]   I'm like, oh my goodness, you know, who are these people?
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.720]   Very humbling place to be.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.260]   But she's made some important discoveries
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.880]   and I want to just highlight one,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.280]   which is this notion of mindset.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.920]   And no, these are not placebo effects,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.600]   but let me just tell you, when you think about stress,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.960]   how you think about stress is really important.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.440]   First of all, you can't lie to yourself,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.240]   but if, for instance, you watch a one or three minute video
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.160]   as she's given subjects in her lab about stress,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.400]   and it tells you all the terrible things
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.240]   that stress does to your immune system and sleep,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.980]   then you experience those things, increases in blood
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.820]   pressure, et cetera.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.420]   However, if you watch a one to three minute video
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.340]   that's also true about the fact that stress can sharpen
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.660]   your decision making for certain kinds of things
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.820]   actually can accentuate your immune system.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.740]   I wish someone would help me get this narrative
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.920]   right out there.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.840]   Stress does not deplete your immune system
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.440]   unless it goes on a long, long time.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.800]   We'll talk about what long means in a moment.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.640]   Why would it?
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.840]   Think about it.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.800]   If you had to fast and move with family
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.040]   or weather a storm of any kind, emotional or physical,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.660]   and you got sick, that wouldn't make any sense.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.680]   It's usually after you're stressed.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.000]   If you've ever been go, go, go or taking care of a loved one
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   or studying or working hard and then you finally go
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.620]   on vacation, you rest, you arrive and you get sick,
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.860]   it's because your immune system shut down, it stopped.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.920]   Your immune system is mobilized by that alertness side
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.000]   of your autonomic nervous system, but you do need sleep.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.880]   You do need sleep and it's actually, we think,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.520]   the slowing of circulation and this is why it's probably
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.300]   not a good idea to exercise if you're already sick
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.840]   and if you're veering towards sick.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.520]   Probably limit the intensity of any kind of interaction
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   as best you can and just still yourself.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.480]   Well, Ali's lab has clearly shown us over and over again
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.640]   that what we know, our knowledge base,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.180]   really does shape the physiology over those outcomes.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.600]   Now you know that stress is both bad and good,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.440]   so which one is it?
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.880]   Does it average to nothing?
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.540]   No, it turns out that you can bias this in one direction
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.160]   or the other depending on which information
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.900]   you're listening to more often.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.840]   I think this is really important.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.320]   You know, I still am trying to get my head and my mind
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   around what's happened over the last few years
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.440]   and where it's placed us, like where did it land us?
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.800]   Are we more resilient now or are we just really beat up?
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.320]   I don't know.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   I really don't know, but I think how we interpret
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.920]   the last few years is gonna make a big difference
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.680]   in terms of how it impacts us.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   How do we know if we are...
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.040]   Thanks, yeah, what we're missing out there, I think,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.300]   is a narrative from somebody that people listen to,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.560]   and I'm not saying that person should be me.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   In fact, it shouldn't be me, but somebody that can help us
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.640]   frame what's just happened to us, much like a good,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.680]   I think that the world needs a good therapist, basically.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.100]   It's a very good therapist.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.560]   So I would call short-term stress,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.920]   which is very beneficial for us,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.400]   is the kind of stress that happens on the order of a day,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.880]   two or three days.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.780]   Not a problem, even if you feel torn apart,
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.000]   provided you can get rest afterwards.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.560]   Long-term stress is the kind of stress that really starts
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.980]   to impede your sleep-wake cycle,
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.480]   make your dreams more stressful and more like nightmares
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.460]   and they're not going away.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.580]   And I can promise you that for those of you
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.160]   that have challenges with sort of a accumulation of stress
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.960]   from the past that's now compounded
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.080]   by what's happening now, et cetera,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.600]   the solution does seem to be to get yourself
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.800]   into a supported environment of some kind
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.440]   that will allow you to go through a full catharsis.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.520]   Again, it doesn't have to require psychedelics.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.080]   That can take you through the full ride
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.160]   of autonomic intensity catharsis of some sort
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.800]   and then relaxation.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.120]   That does seem to be what snaps people out
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.680]   of what we would call longer-term stress
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.800]   and historical stress.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.640]   There's even the question of whether or not
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.340]   focusing directly on the trauma and the story is so critical.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.680]   I think it is.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.060]   Obviously, that's something that should be done
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.880]   with a clinician.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.500]   But stress that impedes your sleep for three nights or more
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.700]   that shifts the pattern of dreams to more anxious dreams,
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.760]   that is more long-term stress.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.380]   And for that, you need to take it seriously.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.540]   And it's the kind of thing where
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.960]   if you don't take it seriously,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   you can start degrading things like your immune system,
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.800]   et cetera.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.000]   And I would say that under those conditions,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.600]   use sleep as a good marker.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.440]   In fact, I'm sure there's some clinicians in the room.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.920]   I mean, one of the questions that is used as a diagnostic
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.280]   for whether or not people are depressed
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.860]   or anxiously depressed is whether or not
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.320]   they're sleeping well or not, right?
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.160]   Again, language is not very good at parsing
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.240]   what's going on inside.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.820]   We have to look to behaviors and regularity of sleep,
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.180]   wake cycles, et cetera.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.520]   Hopefully, that was at least a partial answer.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   I tried to be accurate, but if I were exhaustive,
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.880]   I might actually cure insomnia someday with these podcasts,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.460]   the if nothing else.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.160]   How has hypnosis been impacting my life?
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.400]   I'm in hypnosis now.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.640]   No, I actually spend most of the afternoon in hypnosis.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.520]   Before I do these, I spend a good hour in hypnosis.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.080]   Again, self-directed hypnosis, gosh, it's so unfortunate.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.680]   I keep talking to David Spiegel about this.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.360]   Again, his dad was one of the originators of hypnosis
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.920]   as a valid psychiatric treatment.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.360]   There's even the idea that things like EMDR,
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.840]   the scanning of eyes back and forth
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.880]   while reporting a narrative,
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.200]   may actually be capturing some of the elements of hypnosis.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.960]   Again, and this is why, at least for me,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.820]   I appreciate the opportunity to come together tonight
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.920]   to talk about principles.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.320]   I would hope that after tonight,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.500]   you could look at any practice, anything, any compound,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.420]   any breathing exercise, and just be able to frame up
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.860]   which continuum, where on the continuum,
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.980]   what's it really designed to do,
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.300]   move you up towards alertness or down towards calm.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.820]   And in fact, 'cause I can't help myself,
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.100]   I'll just tell you, for all the breathing stuff,
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.620]   it can be made very simple.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.940]   If your exhales are longer and more vigorous
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.300]   than your inhales, you're gonna get calmed down.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.780]   If your inhales are longer and more vigorous
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.860]   than your exhales, you're going to become more alert.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.820]   If you hold your breath,
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.980]   just eventually just start breathing again.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.500]   The physiology maps perfectly to that.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.580]   That maps perfectly to the physiology.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.300]   And if you, for instance, you do box breathing,
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.020]   inhale, hold, exhale, hold, and this kind of thing,
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.060]   well, you're gonna stay right where you're at.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.380]   You're gonna be on an even plane, more or less, okay?
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.900]   So that sort of hopefully captures
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.540]   all of breath work in one sentence.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   Now I'll answer the question you were asking me.
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.300]   Hypnosis, it's impacted my life in a couple of ways.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   One way is more from a practical, scientific way,
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.900]   which is that my laboratory works on vision
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.660]   and we work on stress.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.420]   And in some ways, those might seem divorced,
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.660]   although now with the cuttlefish
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.580]   and the fact that your eyes narrow their field of view
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.500]   when you're stressed, et cetera,
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.460]   it should become obvious why that is.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.380]   But hypnosis also takes advantage
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.300]   of this really weird kind of cool feature,
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.140]   which is, and this is always weird
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.580]   when you do a group exercise,
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.900]   but I can't really see you all that well.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.420]   I certainly can't see your eyes well enough to know this.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.860]   But David Spiegel, there's actually something in the,
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.580]   this is a valid thing called the Spiegel eye roll test,
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.940]   and it's not the teenage eye roll,
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.960]   that when you look up, while not moving your head,
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.300]   when you look up, you actually are engaging circuits
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.740]   in your brain stem that are involved
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.460]   in generating alertness.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.960]   And when you look down and your eyes close,
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.800]   the opposite is true.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.460]   You're engaging circuits in the brain
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.740]   that are taking you into a calmer state.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.300]   Now, wouldn't it be wonderful if all you had to do
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.740]   was look down and you'd be calm and look up
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.580]   and you'd be alert?
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.800]   That doesn't quite work that way.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.500]   But to induce hypnosis, what they do
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.340]   is they have people look up,
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.820]   and then while looking up, close their eyes,
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.340]   which is actually kind of hard to do.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.320]   Some people can't do it.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.840]   Their eyes roll forward, hence the Spiegel eye roll test.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.940]   Some people, their eyes get,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.180]   you see the whites of their eyes
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.100]   and it looks really spooky,
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.660]   and they're looking up while their eyes close.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.580]   Those people are very prone to hypnosis.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.420]   Why?
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.140]   Well, hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.700]   with alertness and focus.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.460]   It's a contextual narrowing, excuse me.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.420]   So it's like being in early-stage sleep,
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.260]   and that's why stage hypnosis works
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.780]   with people telling people to do certain things.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.300]   It's not that they don't care
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.980]   or they're under the control of the hypnotist.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.800]   It's that they forget what's around them.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.640]   Why?
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.620]   Because their mind is focused internally
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.320]   and on the dialogue with the hypnotist
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.780]   and is not paying attention to context.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.020]   So it's a narrowing of context.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.000]   But hypnosis for me has been very useful
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.900]   because A, it validated the relationship
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.620]   between vision and states of mind.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.980]   It also checks off this box again,
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.220]   which is that to access neuroplasticity, what do you need?
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.620]   You need focus plus you need a state of deep relaxation.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.180]   Usually first focus, then sleep or non-sleep deep rest.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.780]   But Spiegel and his daddy figured out,
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.860]   'cause they're way smarter than I am,
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.540]   that you can get people into that perfect state
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.300]   of neuroplasticity by combining them both in real time
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.660]   through this atypical thing we call hypnosis.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.660]   So I do a daily or maybe every other day hypnosis script
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.580]   that's about, it's self-directed hypnosis script
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.260]   of about five to 15 minutes,
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.140]   usually trying to get myself to be less pissed off
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.140]   about something that I'm really pissed off about, frankly.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.980]   I imagine the stuff I'm really pissed off about
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.820]   in the screen on the left side.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.340]   I think about all the things that make me feel good,
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.340]   and then I keep thinking about how angry I am.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.740]   This is really how it goes.
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.980]   And then over time I've noticed,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.520]   well, you're coupling that bodily state of calm
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.400]   to the anger thing.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.300]   This is all very hard to do in talk therapy.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.580]   No disrespect to talk therapy.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.340]   There's a tremendous advantage to talk therapy
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.700]   that I myself have benefited from it.
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.380]   Although according to certain people in my life,
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.280]   not enough, but hypnosis works
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.820]   because it's capturing neuroplasticity processes.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.660]   Thank you.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.860]   Thank you for that question.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.520]   What are the most effective protocols
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.060]   for boosting the microbiome?
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.860]   Oh, well here I'm very fortunate
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.040]   because my upstairs neighbor at Stanford
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.020]   is the great Justin Sonnenberg,
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.420]   and he and his wife Erica run this amazing lab
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.620]   defining all the principles of the gut microbiome.
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.540]   And they have a really cool idea.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.320]   I don't know if he's serious about this,
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.720]   but I can't help but chuckle
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.900]   when I think that this might actually be true.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   We all know, and this is definitely true,
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.180]   that we all carry around trillions of little microbacteria,
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.020]   not just in our gut that goes from one end of our throat
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.100]   to the other, any mucosal lining, eyes, genitalia, nose,
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.540]   we have microbiomes in our nose, et cetera.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.460]   This is why we're heading into the winter months,
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.300]   being a nasal breather, right?
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.180]   That sounds like crazy new-agey stuff,
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.340]   be a nasal breather.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.420]   There's actually a book written by Paul Ehrlich
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.820]   and Sandra Kahn at Stanford with a foreword by Jared Diamond
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.780]   and Robert Sapolsky, the book "Jaws."
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.060]   So these are some heavy hitters.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.500]   And there's very good evidence that people who mouth breathe
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.220]   are making themselves more prone to illness
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.180]   when nasal breathing, because of the microbiome,
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.300]   it's just a better filter for germs.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.420]   So this winter, and always really,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.080]   try and be a nasal breather all the time.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.260]   One of the best ways to do that
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.020]   if you're not into the mouth-taping thing,
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.540]   which people do, is to try and do some of your exercise
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.340]   with just nasal breathing.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.540]   It'll take a little while to get used to,
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.880]   but I'm not good at the nasal breathing thing
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.180]   'cause I'm always talking.
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.340]   The microbiome is all over us and in us, it's on our skin.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.940]   We're actually exchanging it when we meet and we shake hands.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.940]   Do you know what happens usually in the first 10, 15 seconds?
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.940]   Data from Noam Sobel's lab at the Weisman
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.540]   has shown that we wipe our eyes.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.100]   We wipe other people's molecules on us.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.760]   We're really good at that.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.140]   Just watch these interactions.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.340]   Now everyone's gonna be doing the germ-free handshake.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.940]   They're gonna be fist-bumped.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.840]   But there is this idea that maybe we are the house cats.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.540]   Maybe we're not just transporting all these microbiota
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.700]   because it's good for us.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.860]   What if we're just the vehicles
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.940]   and they're running the planet and they're like,
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.500]   oh, we're running out of some stuff.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   We should figure out somebody to take us to Mars
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.020]   and then we'll take over Mars.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.940]   Maybe it's all them.
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.500]   Justin was the one that told me that and I was like,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.220]   that's kind of eerie if you think about it,
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.060]   but there might be these other intelligences
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.060]   that are hijacking us and that's kind of scary
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.740]   'cause we like to think that we're in charge and who knows.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.180]   What's good for your microbiome or what's good for them?
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.180]   That is, well, prebiotic fiber seems to be very important,
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.460]   but the studies of fiber,
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.620]   at least as it relates to the microbiome
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.580]   are somewhat controversial.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.660]   There was a study done on humans at Stanford
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.060]   by Chris Gardner and Justin Sonnenberg
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.900]   that showed that people who eat one to four,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.780]   they sort of, you have to ramp up
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.700]   servings of low sugar fermented foods.
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.220]   This would be your kimchis, your nattos, your sauerkrauts,
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.780]   your kefirs, your kombuchas, et cetera, per day,
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.620]   develop a very robust microbiome
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.180]   and fiber did not do that.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.740]   In fact, fiber increased the so-called inflammatome,
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.380]   which is the markers for inflammation,
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.900]   but that doesn't mean that fiber is bad.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.380]   Fiber actually is, getting enough fiber
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.780]   is correlated with a number of other things that are great,
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.700]   like reduced cardiovascular disease, for instance,
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.480]   cancers of the colon, for instance.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.680]   So fiber and gut microbiota.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.240]   Prebiotics, probiotics, probably only necessary
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.660]   if you have a dysbiosis, if you've been taking antibiotics
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.780]   or if for some reason you're depleted of the microbiome.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.480]   One of the great ways to deplete your microbiome
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.780]   is to just eat highly processed foods,
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.360]   but hopefully most people aren't doing that.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.020]   So prebiotic fiber and these low sugar fermented foods,
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.500]   and then someone always says beer, right?
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.940]   Someone always, yes, yes, beer will support your microbiome,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.680]   but it might do other things too.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.580]   So in general, low alcohol, low sugar fermented foods,
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.660]   reduced the number of inflammatome markers,
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.300]   that's very, very clear from the Sonnenberg data.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.620]   And then there are other ways, of course,
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.860]   the microbiome actually interacts with temperature,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.060]   so the cold exposure thing
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.780]   is actually good for your microbiome,
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.580]   but, and I wanna really emphasize this,
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.220]   if you hear about studies that such and such improves
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.540]   such and such, keep in mind that anything
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.000]   that improves your sleep, your microbiome,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.780]   or your social interactions will improve
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.760]   basically everything else.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.180]   And those are what we call modulating effects,
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.240]   not mediating effects.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.560]   This is really important, and we teach first year
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.740]   graduate students and medical students about this.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.860]   Like for instance, if there were a fire alarm pulled
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.720]   right now, God forbid, it would modulate
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.040]   all of your attention, but would you say
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.940]   that fire alarms mediate attention?
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.860]   No, it's not directly in the line of mechanism,
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.260]   but it can adjust an existing mechanism.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.740]   So great sleep is great for everything,
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.940]   but it doesn't control it directly.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.020]   And so things like getting great sleep,
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.940]   keeping your microbiome healthy,
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.300]   getting enough sunlight, et cetera,
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   they provide a kind of buoyancy
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.460]   to all the organs and systems of your body,
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.020]   but they aren't necessarily the thing that cures ADHD.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.140]   But of course, if you have ADHD or issues with focus,
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.360]   getting enough sleep will help.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.780]   Is nutrition the way to cure your ADHD?
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.580]   No, but if you improve your gut microbiome,
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.700]   it's very likely that your neurotransmitter systems
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.180]   will improve, limiting sugar will help, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.180]   So there's reason to think that great sleep,
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.860]   solid nutrition, microbiome, social interactions, exercise,
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.780]   those are kind of the big five.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.940]   There are others too, of course.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.940]   With those, you set a good buoyancy to all the other systems
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.060]   and then we get into the things
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.780]   of how to directly increase focus
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.020]   or modulate dopamine and so on and so forth.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:41.860]   Oh, well, I realize some people are afraid of dogs.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.880]   We actually have a dog stimulus in our fear lab.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.420]   We get people that are terrified of dogs.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.080]   We hired this dog trainer guy who has these pit bulls
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.780]   that will attack you while you're in VR.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.780]   By the end, people are a little more comfortable
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.940]   with dogs in general.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.980]   For you and me, if you're not afraid of dogs,
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.540]   that's not terribly terrifying.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.960]   But if you are, even the thought of that
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.980]   can be pretty terrifying.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.620]   A couple of things people have thought about,
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.380]   the eye contact thing, they make eye contact.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.960]   We're big on eye contact, humans too.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.480]   Eye contact is meaningful in terms of oxytocin release.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.300]   That's all real, those data are,
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.380]   the more and more data that come out from better studies,
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.960]   eye contact is a big deal.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.720]   I think it's also that just the dogs are always game
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.960]   to show up exactly where you wanna meet them
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.780]   and they always show up
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.700]   in their most loving possible state for them.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.340]   It's a pretty simple equation if you get it right
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.540]   and they need proper care.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:44.540]   But I mean, Costello was unique because the bulldog also,
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.520]   you don't wanna get me going on dog breeds,
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.680]   but the bulldog also looks disappointed all the time.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.380]   And then you do something it likes
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.480]   and then it looks delighted
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.180]   and pretty soon you're working for their approval.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.300]   And we were like the odd couple, me and him.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.900]   And I realized he's got me trained really, really well
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.020]   to do my best to please him and delight him,
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.340]   which delighted me.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.820]   And there I was on the hook.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.900]   So that's one reason.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.660]   I think there's also another reason which is super nerdy,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.600]   which is this C-tactile fiber thing,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.340]   which is you have these little nerve endings in your skin.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.620]   And we know, of course, that oxytocin is released
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.540]   from parent and child.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.080]   We know this from neuroimaging, et cetera.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.060]   We know oxytocin is released from romantic interact,
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.860]   non-sexual romantic touch.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.020]   One of the things that is very powerful
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.940]   for the release of oxytocin, very powerful,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.940]   is non-sexual grooming touch among members of a species
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.300]   or even across species.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.340]   Those pictures of monkeys picking around in each other
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.660]   or people who insist on popping things on one another
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.300]   or people who go to the hairdresser or the barber
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.380]   and they like touch.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.620]   It doesn't even have to be massage,
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.860]   massive oxytocin release.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.220]   Those data don't get as much play as all the data
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.580]   on oxytocin and love.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.820]   It's called the love hormone,
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.860]   but it's basically a neurochemical signaling system
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.740]   for this interaction feels good
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.580]   and is very much of the present.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.980]   And I think that's an important distinction
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.120]   to make more broadly is that dopamine is really about
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.320]   the pursuit of all things beyond the confines of our skin.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.500]   I'm gonna get that thing.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.100]   I want that because it's all about anticipation.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.980]   And when you have some distance between yourself
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.100]   and the thing that you think will deliver,
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.140]   whatever it is you want, usually pleasure
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.980]   in some form or another or excitement,
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.360]   whatever your pleasure is or combined,
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.260]   then you actually have to mobilize
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.420]   and dopamine is the precursor to adrenaline.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.300]   A lot of people don't know that.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.020]   Adrenaline is made from dopamine.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.460]   It gets you into motion.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.100]   Then you have the reward systems that are more
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.220]   about what you have from your skin surface inward.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.100]   So this is gentle touch, holding hands
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.320]   and indeed stroking your dog probably does that
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.880]   for you to activate the C fibers as they're called
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.420]   in your skin, which feed right into these serotonin
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.320]   and oxytocin systems of the brain.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.340]   Sounds a little pop psychology ish, but it's a real thing.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.920]   And it exists in essentially all mammalian species.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.540]   So I think a lot of us just like dogs
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.640]   'cause they'll let us just pet them all day.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.000]   Some people like to be touched a little bit more or less
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.600]   even when they trust is all consent.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.580]   It's consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.300]   In this case, species appropriate.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.100]   Those are the conditions, very important.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.320]   When I was a kid, I had, I don't know why,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.160]   my sister's in the office.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.520]   I don't know why she decided to do this in the first place,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.060]   but I loved having my face kind of like pet like that.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.680]   I still like it, but don't try it 'cause she's the only one.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.240]   She can't do it anymore even.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.720]   So we all have these things that feel good
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.560]   and I think it feels good
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.600]   because it releases these chemicals.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.360]   And these are ancient systems, ancient, ancient systems
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.000]   that we all have and I think dogs let us do that.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.360]   And cats toy with us with this one
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.700]   because there are those cats that let you pet them,
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.660]   but most of the time they're doing it to you
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.280]   and then they withdraw.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   And I don't know many dogs that do that.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.500]   So I think people, I'm gonna answer the question finally.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.400]   I think dogs, we love them so much
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.780]   because they let us pet them as much as we want.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.520]   And cats play this very diabolical game
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.740]   that's a lot more like human relationships.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.540]   How can night owls best function
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.720]   in a society made for morning birds?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.740]   Can you change your chronotype
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.860]   or do us night owls just have to suffer?
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.900]   Okay, well, as a former night owl,
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.120]   I used to work long hours in the lab.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.580]   I still work long hours, but less in the lab.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.140]   Just so happens, that's the way the career goes.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.980]   I put tinfoil on the windows, I would lock the doors,
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.620]   I'd blast the music and I would stay there over the holidays
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.300]   until I had to go home just for the holiday events.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.740]   And my clock would drift, so I became a night owl
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.420]   and then my clock would flip and everyone was gone.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.900]   Your mind gets really tweaked
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.780]   when you're not interacting with anybody.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.600]   By the way, seeing faces in the morning
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.700]   and seeing faces at some point during the day,
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.620]   once you're ready to face the day,
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.760]   very important for mental health.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.980]   This is something I wish more people knew about.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.840]   It also, and here I'm not trying to evoke
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.480]   any kind of sentimentality, but when you think about people
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.920]   who just are clearly not doing well,
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.280]   whether or not they have shelter or not,
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.120]   how often do we actually make direct eye contact nowadays?
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.620]   It's not very often.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.840]   So eye contact is important,
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.920]   but I've also shifted to being a morning person.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.600]   And so here's the thing, if you are a true night owl,
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.280]   that means that your circadian clock,
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.780]   meaning the genes that control the area of your brain
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.420]   and your hypothalamus that controls wake sleep cycles,
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.040]   is fundamentally different.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.800]   Very unlikely you'll become a morning person
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.480]   without being a kind of angry morning person.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.720]   So you can use that argument and you can cite me.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.980]   However, as we get older, it is true
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.760]   that the amount of slow wave sleep to REM sleep
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.040]   tends to change and we can do better
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.780]   on shorter bouts of sleep,
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.320]   mostly because we're getting less rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.400]   And even if we try, we can't.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   Those people would probably be better off
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.240]   sticking to a limited amount of sleep at night
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.520]   and then getting a short nap.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.040]   The rule with naps is nap if you want to,
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:18.920]   don't if you don't want,
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.520]   but not if it interferes with your nighttime sleep.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.860]   And if you can't nap, do some sort of non-sleep deep rest
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.960]   or NSDR, as I refer to it, non-sleep deep rest.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.040]   So you can probably shift your clock
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.900]   by anywhere from two to eight hours.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.600]   And that's true for jet lag as well.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.080]   Light is going to be the best way,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.500]   but if you really wanna shift,
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.060]   you're gonna have to stack the big three or four.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.640]   Light, so get light when you wanna be awake.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.780]   Temperature, you have to increase
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.900]   your body temperature to wake up.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.140]   You have to decrease body temperature to go to sleep.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.220]   Keep in mind, if you get into an ice bath or cold shower,
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.120]   you get very, very cold.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.220]   But then what happens,
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.820]   it's like putting an ice pack on the thermostat,
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.020]   your body temperature goes up.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.180]   Remember thermogenesis,
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.460]   that's the warming of the body in response to cold.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.700]   Of course, if you stay in a long time,
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.460]   you'll get crispy cold, you'll turn into a popsicle.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.480]   But the idea is that if you take a cold shower
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.280]   and you get some bright light and you get some exercise
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.580]   and you drink some caffeine,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.860]   you can train your system to expect that
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.100]   at a certain time of day.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.760]   And you'll wanna go to sleep a little bit earlier
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.300]   or much earlier and you'll wanna wake up
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.360]   when you stack those things.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.580]   But that also means not taking caffeine and cold showers
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.840]   and doing exercise late at night.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.780]   So it's gonna take some work.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.260]   But those are the big four.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.260]   It's gonna be light is the most powerful way to shift.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.160]   More light awake, less light asleep.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.180]   Temperature increase awake, temperature decrease asleep.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.380]   Food is the other one.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.620]   Eating, you can force yourself to eat breakfast
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.720]   even if you're not a breakfast eater.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.980]   This works when you travel too,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.620]   just get onto the local meal schedule
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.460]   'cause you have a clock system in your gut,
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.540]   believe it or not.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.380]   You wanna synchronize that with your brain.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.900]   And then activity, getting some sort of exercise.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.300]   But it takes a little bit of work, but you can do it.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.500]   You can definitely do it.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.300]   If you're nocturnal, that's weird,
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.020]   unless it's because of your work,
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.000]   in which case there are tools for shift work
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.220]   that we've put out there on the podcast.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.460]   Your podcast has been well in success.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.340]   How do you see it growing over the next few years?
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.460]   Honestly, I try and live in the tunnel
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.220]   of lack of understanding and awareness
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.060]   about what's happening with all this.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.900]   I really do.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.460]   Lex suggested we do the podcast.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.860]   That's a true story, doing it.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.640]   I still really do feel very much like I did
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.480]   when I was a little kid.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.940]   I'm just gonna keep trying to learn and share.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.660]   I'd love for people to share the tools.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.860]   I don't want credit for them.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.860]   If people credit us, great.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.680]   But if you think about it, most of what we talk about
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.300]   are not things that you buy.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.700]   These are tools that, again, work the first time every time.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.340]   I always say behavioral tools first,
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.420]   then nutrition, supplementation.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.640]   And then for some people, prescription drugs
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.460]   or some of these more experimental drugs make sense.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.300]   For some people, it doesn't.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.120]   For instance, I don't think kids
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.100]   should be doing psychedelics.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.620]   I mean, childhood is enough of a psychedelic experience
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.720]   in and of itself.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.800]   But I had an amazing clinician.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.420]   He's actually a triple board-certified
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.420]   psychiatrist neurologist at Stanford,
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.060]   Nolan Williams, on the podcast.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.340]   And he talked about even the use of Ibogaine and MDMA,
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.800]   even in some younger populations,
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.640]   but again, with therapeutic oversight.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.320]   It blew my mind.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.120]   I also didn't know this, that MDMA I thought was toxic.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.560]   Please don't just take it off the street.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.280]   But if you're interested in clinical trials,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.340]   there are great clinical trials happening through maps.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.300]   And you can look at Nolan's website as well.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.660]   Most of the knowledge about the effects of MDMA
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.660]   is from the LDS community
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.580]   because they volunteered for these studies
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.160]   because it's not on the banned substance list.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.120]   And so there's a lot of knowledge.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.580]   And they don't tend to, or they don't use other substances
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.300]   like alcohol and marijuana and cocaine.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.820]   So much of what we know about the effects of MDMA
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.540]   on the body and brain is from that community,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.180]   other communities too as well.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.500]   So what are we gonna do with the podcast?
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.420]   Well, every Monday I'm gonna keep putting out episodes
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.220]   until they put me in that grave with the thing.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.060]   Thank you.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.620]   (audience applauding)
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.120]   It is a labor of love and it's a lot of fun.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.540]   And we're just always trying to make them better, clearer.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.080]   Somehow they're not getting shorter.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.020]   I always tell Rob, this one's gonna be 90 minutes.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.460]   And he's like, yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.300]   I think for me, one thing that it has brought
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.020]   that's really wonderful is the opportunity
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.260]   to learn from people in other domains
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.620]   that are far better at putting information
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.500]   and things into the world.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.820]   So I've been, I hope he doesn't mind me saying this.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.540]   I've been very blessed to have become really good friends
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.500]   with Rick Rubin, who's been really helpful to me.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.620]   He has an amazing book on creativity coming out.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.760]   That's not a plug for the book,
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.760]   although I guess I just kind of accidentally did it.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.240]   But Rick, of course, has produced and created
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.300]   all this amazing music, everything from Run DMC,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.180]   BC Boys, Slayer, Johnny Cash, everything, just amazing.
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.200]   And one of the things that he's been impressing on me
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.140]   is that it's very important to stay focused
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.540]   on the process of what you're doing
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:09.140]   and to really not get into too much of what that's,
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.080]   how that's landing.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.740]   So I do like to hear when things are not clear.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.260]   That's really helpful to me.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.420]   I do like to hear suggestions about great people
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.460]   to bring on the podcast.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.460]   I love criticism, most of the time.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.820]   I try my best, it's hard sometimes,
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.220]   but I really try and just absorb it for what it is.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.340]   But I love that aspect of interacting in this,
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.140]   even though this is very fairly unidirectional.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.820]   Hopefully there'll be more opportunities
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.780]   for kind of dialoguing and learning what's out there.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.340]   My real hope is that practitioners
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.940]   will start to incorporate things.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.660]   And again, it's not about me.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.820]   I'm gleaning from fields and the work
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.820]   and discoveries of other people
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.420]   and trying to thread across fields.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.100]   So that's where I see the podcast going
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.260]   just more of the same, more of the same, more of the same,
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.740]   but a lot more and more topics as best we can.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.620]   Lots of guests.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.620]   And we actually have an episode with Rick coming out
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.860]   at some point about creativity,
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.060]   which I think is one of the more interesting aspects
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.420]   of our being.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.500]   So you can watch for that.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.860]   What is the stress inoculation protocol
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.900]   for the workplace anxiety?
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.340]   Speaking, does the principle of staying calm
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.460]   under high adrenaline stage?
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.500]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.340]   I think if you were to pick some sort of practice
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.340]   that you could do privately and safely,
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.260]   again, how cold should you make the water?
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.980]   Cold enough that it's really uncomfortable
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.140]   and you really, really wanna get out,
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.420]   you can safely stay in.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.820]   And that's why we never say 40 degrees,
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.220]   because you can kill yourself with cold water.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.460]   It's just hard to do.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.140]   You have to get really, really cold
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.580]   before you kill yourself.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.980]   And open bodies of water aren't good.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.660]   Actually, I told my friend, Samir Hattar,
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.940]   he's the director of Chronobiology Unit
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.460]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.580]   He came on the podcast, got him really excited.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.860]   He's great about all the stuff on light and sleep,
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.220]   taught me a lot of that over the years.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.060]   We're good friends.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.100]   I told him about the cold water thing
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.540]   and he got into some river in Bethesda
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.900]   and almost drowned.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.860]   I was like, Samir, now he has this story
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.420]   about how he almost drowned and what he was,
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.500]   and he thought about a paper he wanted to write
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.940]   while he was almost drowning.
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:11.060]   So just be careful, open bodies of water,
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.140]   that kind of thing.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.220]   But I think you can quickly see within about a week or so
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.540]   of doing some sort of deliberate adrenaline release.
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.180]   It could be cyclic hyperventilation,
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.420]   25 hyperventilated breaths with a short breath hold repeat,
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.500]   done two or three times.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.900]   We have good data to support that in the lab.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   You see massive shifts in people's baseline level.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.660]   You become a little bit more like Costello, you really do.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.260]   And the way to think about it is,
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.020]   if you are more on a seesaw than on the continuum,
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.180]   you get better at loosening that hinge
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.700]   and controlling that hinge.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.300]   Or you can imagine kind of moving up and down that seesaw
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.020]   a little bit more easily.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.860]   And then of course,
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.020]   you have to place yourself into the environment.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.660]   You have to test yourself in that environment.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.860]   And some people will do Toastmasters and things like that
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.740]   and it can work.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.260]   My way, I don't know if it works for everybody,
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.940]   my way is just start talking and don't stop.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.340]   I can't feel the stress.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.020]   What do you think will be the next hot topic,
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.340]   new trend in the field in neuroscience,
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.420]   behavioral therapeutics?
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.600]   Ooh, I like that.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.300]   'Cause I have a lot of opinions about that.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.120]   First of all,
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.220]   I do not think it's gonna be brain machine interface.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.500]   My good friend, Eddie Chang,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.620]   who I've known since we were nine, he came on the podcast.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.300]   He works on epilepsy, he's the chair of neurosurgery.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.140]   We had a bird club when we were kids.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.220]   Had two members.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:34.740]   You had to know the names of all the talking birds
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.820]   and then you had to know which one was the best talker
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.020]   and it's the minor bird.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.960]   And of course, no one wanted to join.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.020]   No one even took the test,
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.820]   but he became a neurosurgeon
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.780]   and does brain machine interface.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.380]   He's doing truly incredible work,
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.820]   getting people with locked-in syndrome to speak
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.340]   through a device implanted under the skull.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.140]   They just think what they wanna say.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.120]   These are people who haven't moved or shared a word
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.980]   with anybody and they're now communicating,
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.100]   but here's what's really cool.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.140]   He has also realized that facial expression is a lot.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.580]   It's one thing to see on a screen what somebody in a chair
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.960]   or a hospital bed is thinking, that's wonderful,
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.560]   but facial expression is such a rich part of this.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.480]   So this is a really good use of AI.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.240]   He has now created very realistic iPad images
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.180]   of that person's face
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.180]   and so they're actually speaking the words
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.940]   and people form a deep relationship to the person
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.540]   who's right next to their avatar.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.620]   So that's a positive use, I think, of avatars
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.200]   and Eddie's doing amazing work.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.100]   That kind of work, a brain machine interface,
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.300]   neural link, et cetera,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.620]   I think is going to be very useful and popular
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.340]   in the realm of therapeutics for Parkinson's,
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.360]   movement disorders, epilepsy, locked-in syndrome, et cetera.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.300]   I think we are many, many, many decades
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.700]   from chip implantation into the brain for things
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.860]   like enhancing memory.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.420]   And frankly, I wouldn't want it.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.040]   Not because I wouldn't want to enhance my memory,
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.820]   but because of what I said earlier,
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.740]   is that the nervous system
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.180]   has a certain amount of real estate
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.980]   and you don't want to make that real estate very lopsided.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.520]   And so I think we're going to see something very different
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.860]   in the next 10, 20 years.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.860]   And I hope, hope, hope this carries over
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.040]   to the younger populations.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.980]   I think we're going to hopefully start learning
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.500]   about our nervous system and what it can do.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.280]   And the fact that we have these preexisting circuits in us
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.780]   that we can learn to leverage
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.220]   that work first time, every time.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.480]   So I'm strongly biased in my answer,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.400]   but I think that it still remains an open question,
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.520]   for instance, whether or not people could require less,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.660]   perhaps, or no medication for certain things.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.700]   And I say certain things because for conditions
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.560]   like schizophrenia, bipolar in particular,
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.900]   medication OCD has proved very effective,
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.700]   but then there are a whole other set of conditions
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.660]   like depression and anxiety
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.420]   for which behavioral tools really work,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.180]   but most people just don't even know they exist.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.260]   So that's my hope.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.340]   And again, I love the therapeutic community
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.700]   could try and expand their toolkit.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.800]   I also think we're starting to see a blurring of the lines
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.340]   between different fields of psychology.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.660]   So it's no longer psychoanalytic
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.760]   versus cognitive behavioral versus dialectic
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.100]   versus EMDR versus hypnosis,
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.160]   that it's all going to be governed
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.840]   by some central principles.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.180]   All those camps, it's just silly, frankly, to me.
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.720]   It makes sense academically why those came to be,
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.280]   but in neuroscience, we had the same thing.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.400]   You used to have to pick.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.340]   It was like a John Hughes film from the '80s.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.060]   Are you going to be a jock or a punker or a popular kid?
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.860]   Now it's not like that, and half this audience
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.300]   is looking at me like, "What are you talking about?"
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.140]   And that's exactly the point, which is, I'll never forget,
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.200]   I grew up in the skateboard thing.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.060]   The first time I saw someone wearing skateboarding shoes,
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.460]   I was like, "Damn, they skateboard."
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.760]   And they're like, "No, people are just wearing this stuff."
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.460]   Right, so what you start to realize
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.640]   is it all blended together, which is great.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.920]   And in the field of neuroscience, you used to have to pick.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.520]   Are you an anatomist or a physiologist?
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.060]   Are you into neural computation?
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.580]   Now your lab has to do it all,
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.780]   or you collaborate with people.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.380]   Those divisions have really melted
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.300]   because people are interested in questions,
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.100]   and they're interested in answers.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.220]   And don't get me started, but the careerism
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.860]   of the requirement for everyone
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.820]   to have their own independent laboratory
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.060]   and say, "This is my mission."
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.440]   That is one of the worst things about science,
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.600]   because everything we know says that collaboration,
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.400]   collaboration, collaboration leads to faster progress.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.980]   And I'm not gonna take on the whole academic system.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.560]   It's been very good to me,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.520]   but I'd like to see a blurring of the boundaries.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.160]   It used to be that labs weren't,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.120]   here, I'm really guilty, Huberman Lab,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.780]   but it used to be that labs were named
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.920]   after the problem they worked on,
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.320]   Vision Lab, Stress Lab, Happiness Lab.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.000]   I like that quite a bit more,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.500]   but I screwed up and called this whole thing
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.480]   the Huberman Lab.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.640]   You've had a number of performance,
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.960]   nutrition, fitness experts on your show.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.620]   What changes have you made to your fitness protocol
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.160]   including nutrition?
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   Oh, yeah, well, I'm an omnivore,
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.060]   so I like those things they call carbohydrates.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.200]   And I eat them in moderation.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.880]   So I've never really been too extreme about any of this
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.800]   or the fasting thing,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.080]   although I do kind of just,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.560]   I'm not very hungry in the morning.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.960]   That's also 'cause I like to eat a lot at night.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.920]   I wake up not that hungry.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.280]   So what have I changed?
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.740]   Well, in terms of the fitness stuff,
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.160]   I've definitely started to incorporate more nasal breathing
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.640]   when I do cardiovascular work
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.280]   because it has eliminated any sleep apnea I had.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.820]   And sleep apnea is very, very bad, very, very bad.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:37.200]   I wish I could say snoring was no big deal,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.480]   but we know based on work at the Stanford Sleep Lab,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.060]   Penn Sleep Lab, other sleep labs,
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.520]   that people who have sleep apnea are really in for trouble
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.500]   for a number of reasons.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.480]   So you want to learn to be a nasal breather.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.200]   And some people will tape their mouth shut
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.960]   with medical tape when they go to sleep.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.760]   Other people will just start doing cardiovascular work,
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.240]   keeping their mouth closed.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.700]   And that requires that you not go too intensely,
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:04.040]   but it does create a dilation of the nasal passages.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.220]   Those sinuses can dilate.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.320]   So I've definitely done that.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.720]   And at the end of training,
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.040]   I try and do a one minute or three minute decompress,
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.360]   not immediately look at my phone
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.680]   to kind of learn to shift from high intensity
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.800]   kind of thinking and to lower intensity thinking
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   and shift throughout the day.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.920]   Task switching, I think,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.040]   is gonna be a big area of science
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.160]   and neuroscience in general.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.720]   We still don't know how to task switch well,
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.320]   how to shift the mind from focus to defocus and back again.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.160]   That's something that there's...
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.040]   But by the way, this is, I think,
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.240]   a rich opportunity for people to develop tools.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.200]   We don't know a lot about that.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.680]   We got too caught up on consciousness flow and free will.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.280]   And that stuff is great, but I like, as you can tell,
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.400]   I like tools, I like physiology.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.320]   I like the things that work in my lifetime
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.120]   and that we can figure out and agree upon in my lifetime.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.360]   Let's see.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.680]   Got it.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.760]   And I'm told that this final question,
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.840]   when they had put the clock up here earlier too,
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.280]   they said that we're gonna run it for 60 minutes.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.640]   My first question was, where's the snooze button?
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   It's not gonna keep going,
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.240]   but I think they're gonna hold me to it.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.040]   And I know people, this is New York after all.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.920]   There are other fun things to do.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.280]   For things that take a long time,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.440]   career, pursuing a degree,
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.880]   is there a right way to know that we're on the right path?
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.200]   Is there a way to know we're on the right path?
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.960]   Thank you for that question.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.440]   I get asked this a lot.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   And gosh, there's so much information out there,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.880]   so much information about this.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.600]   We don't yet have a gauge of whether or not
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   we're in too much stress or not,
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.980]   but there is one tool that's used
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.700]   in the free diving community and in other communities
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.520]   that you can use as a kind of thermometer
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.000]   of how well you're functioning.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.400]   And some of you may know it already,
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.240]   and if you do, forgive me,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.360]   it's this carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.480]   So why am I answering this question this way?
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.100]   Well, I like to start with actionable tools.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.960]   If, for instance, you were to just take
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.680]   three or four breaths, and then take a big, deep breath,
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.580]   and then do a very slow, controlled exhale,
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.120]   could be through your nose or through your mouth,
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.600]   ideally through your nose,
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.080]   and you're trying to make that exhale as long as possible
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.500]   until your lungs are empty, and you time that.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.560]   That's called the carbon dioxide discard rate,
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.840]   or discard rate, or the exhale discard rate.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.300]   And it tells you how well you're controlling your diaphragm
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.360]   using something called the phrenic nerve.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.500]   It also tells you how well you're managing carbon dioxide,
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.260]   and how well you're managing stress.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.540]   And if you're very stressed,
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.340]   that number will be very, very short.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.240]   And I'm not talking about how long
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.440]   you can sit with lungs empty.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.540]   I'm talking about an honest appraisal
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.240]   of how long you can control that exhale for.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.020]   And if it's anywhere from zero to 20 seconds,
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.640]   your stress level is high.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.700]   And if it's from 20 to 40 seconds,
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.020]   it's moderate, and longer than 40 seconds
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.660]   means you have good control over your
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.460]   carbon dioxide system, more or less.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.140]   Now these are averages, and guess what?
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.860]   It has nothing to do with fitness.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.540]   And also, it has nothing to do with you per se,
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.140]   because if you do this when you first wake up
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.260]   after a good night's sleep,
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.860]   you'll have a long discard rate.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.740]   If you do this after running,
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.460]   you'll have a short discard rate.
[00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.620]   You're not out of breath,
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.660]   you're just not managing the system very well.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.800]   So you can touch into this every once in a while
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.340]   as sort of a blood pressure reading type thing.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.820]   This is very back of the envelope, it's not perfect.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.820]   But it works well enough that alongside things
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.380]   like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, et cetera,
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.560]   you can get a window into how well you're managing stress.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.160]   Why am I answering this question this way?
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.340]   Well, this is something I recommend
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:41.380]   doing every once in a while,
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.080]   especially if you are in a period of a career,
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.140]   or any kind of pursuit,
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.340]   where you are feeling like you're grinding.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.620]   I think once your carbon dioxide discard rate
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.540]   starts to really get shorter and shorter,
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.040]   you're having trouble sleeping,
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.900]   I think it's time to focus on
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.280]   reestablishing that buoyancy to your nervous system,
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.180]   because then and only then can you make good judgments
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.380]   about whether or not you're in the right trajectory for you.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.320]   Now, in terms of the larger psychological themes,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.420]   are you doing something that brings you meaning or not?
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.620]   That gets into some complicated territory.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.220]   We're very good at assigning meaning retrospectively,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.020]   and saying, well, that was a good experience,
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.240]   because we had it and we learned from it, et cetera.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.460]   But I think most people would like to avoid things
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.820]   that they can only look back on and say it was useful,
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.820]   because I learned something from it.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.740]   And for that, I'll just give the default,
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.820]   but I think, at least to me, accurate answer,
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.820]   which is the more often that you can tap into that feeling
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.900]   of excitement and delight in your work,
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.540]   even if from small things or from surprising things,
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.340]   or from the social interactions
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.880]   that you're able to glean from that work,
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.360]   the longer and better you're going to be able
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.940]   to pursue that line of work.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.460]   For me, in graduate school, I was very isolated.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.820]   I worked alone in the lab.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.220]   Maybe it was 'cause of the tinfoil I put on the walls
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.380]   or the windows.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.220]   I don't know.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.380]   In fact, my graduate advisors,
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.900]   one complaint was that I'd seemed unfriendly.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.880]   I wasn't unfriendly, I was just busy.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.300]   But I got to be very good friends with the janitorial staff,
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.860]   'cause they were the only one around
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.380]   at the time I was working, were a few other people.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.580]   And those small interactions actually became
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.220]   very significant to me and became sources of brief,
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.380]   but to me, at least at the time, meaningful social exchange.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.900]   And of course, eventually I made friends
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.660]   and had relationships of other kinds
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.420]   and things that were healthy as well.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.980]   But I think learning to tap into this love
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.000]   of what you're doing is sometimes hard,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.020]   but you have to look for it.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.140]   It's an active process.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:43.340]   And I'll default to the work and the podcast
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.380]   that's coming with Rick Rubin.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.820]   And a lot of what he talks about in terms of creativity
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.340]   is about accessing what he and others
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.140]   have talked about as the source.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.340]   If that is an abstract, I don't know what is.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.920]   But the source is this ability to see yourself
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.620]   as more of a portal for getting certain things
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.220]   done in the world than being so careerist
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.120]   and focused on whether or not outcomes
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.160]   are really matching what you need.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.260]   It involves some mental flexibility
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.260]   and is, of course, okay to pivot back and forth.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.540]   But we can only access this feeling of delight and joy
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.080]   and this feeling that we're somehow connected
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.740]   to some larger theme, aka meaning,
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.940]   I think when we are able to be calm enough
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.220]   and not so focused.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.500]   But in order to get anything done,
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.620]   we have to be hyper focused.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.400]   And that brings me back to the basic principle
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.240]   of today's whole discussion,
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.820]   which is that it's not about landing yourself
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.900]   in a state of focus, motivation, and drive
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.840]   or in a state of deep sleep, certainly not in a coma.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.280]   It's about being able to move up and down
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.240]   the various continuums that allow you to access focus
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.540]   and real gas pedal down to the floor
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.800]   kind of thinking and action,
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.260]   but then also deliberately back off,
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.320]   transition to periods of rest.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.680]   And the real key is for you to feel
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.840]   like you're in the driver's seat.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.000]   If we know anything from the last 100 plus years
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.980]   of psychology and neuroscience literature,
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.660]   it's that if an animal or a person feels
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.960]   that they are in control of the physiological process
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.880]   within them, and they know they can get themselves out
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.760]   some way, somehow, at some point,
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.980]   and back into a state that they want somehow,
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.480]   some way, at some point,
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.040]   well then all the language around meaning
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.220]   and happiness and delight starts to emerge.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.780]   So learn to move along those continuums,
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.740]   learn to do it deliberately,
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.680]   and I wish you the very best of luck in it.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.780]   I know it works.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.400]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.960]   Thank you.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.460]   Thank you so much, thank you.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.260]   (audience applauding)
