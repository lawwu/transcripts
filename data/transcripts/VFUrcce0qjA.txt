[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   every 30 to 50 years, someone comes up with the same sort of idea, which is we know that human
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.360]   beings love opioids in different forms, right? We also know they're highly addicted and lead to sort
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.760]   of a terrible cycle. So all of a sudden comes along this innovator says, you know what? I've
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.120]   got a new opioid and you know, it's safe. You don't have to worry about getting addicted from
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.240]   this one. It's magical. It won't work. And you know, a hundred years ago, that thing was called
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.080]   heroin. 200 years ago, that thing was called morphine. 300 years ago, that thing was called
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.200]   Maldonum, right? We have these new drugs, which have come in and they've never been safe. But you
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.760]   know, in our case, it was OxyContin and you know, the magic of the time relief was supposed to make
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.160]   it, make it safe. And it wasn't safe. I, you know, I pushed back against the universal basic income
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.880]   advocates who I think are basically engaging in a materialist fallacy of thinking that a human
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.520]   being's life is shaped by their take on pay. They feel quite dangerous to me because they feel like
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.440]   like they're going to play into rising joblessness in America,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840]   which feels like a path forward.
