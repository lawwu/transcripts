[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.960]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.340]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.820]   My guest today is Dr. Peter Etia.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.760]   Dr. Peter Etia is a medical doctor who did his training
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.960]   at Stanford University School of Medicine
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.320]   and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.720]   Dr. Etia is one of the world's most trusted voices
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.000]   on the topics of healthspan and lifespan,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.120]   and with good reason.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.440]   He is known to systematically review the research literature,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.560]   the clinical trials,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.320]   and he maintains an avid clinical practice.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.520]   So when it comes to the topic
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.120]   of whether or not a particular molecule or supplement
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360]   or prescription drug is indeed something
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.560]   that we should be thinking about
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.000]   and perhaps even taking
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560]   in order to improve our healthspan and lifespan,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.800]   Dr. Etia is the person that I choose
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.720]   to sit down with and discuss it.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.700]   So today we are going to discuss the so-called NAD pathway,
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.920]   this is a pathway that's received a lot of attention
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.240]   in recent years as a potential target
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.320]   for improving lifespan, that is for living longer.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.200]   Today, we discuss the various molecules in this pathway
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.360]   and the various approaches to increasing NAD,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.600]   which is the end target goal of anyone that's trying
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.400]   to augment the NAD pathway, so to speak.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   So for instance, we talk about taking NR versus NMN
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.740]   versus direct infusions, or even orally taking NAD.
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.200]   And we compare them in terms of both what's known
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.640]   and what is not known about their ability to get into cells
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.400]   and any efficacy they may have
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.200]   for either longevity or healthspan.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   Dr. Etia and I compare and contrast the literature on this,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   again, both research and clinical literature,
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   and we discuss whether or not he or I take NAD, NMN, or NR,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920]   and if so, or if not, the reasons for that.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.900]   We also each go through our own supplement regimen,
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.720]   which of course reflects what we do believe
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.000]   can potentially have an effect
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.240]   on healthspan and/or lifespan.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.640]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.800]   you'll learn a lot about NAD.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.520]   You'll learn a lot about the biological pathway.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.420]   You'll learn a lot about the delivery routes,
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.400]   the various supplements,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.260]   and why people think they may be useful, why others,
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.200]   perhaps even Dr. Etia and myself,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.640]   think they may not be useful for longevity.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.720]   You'll have to listen to find out what the answer is there.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.560]   I should also mention that we give somewhat of an overview
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.920]   or a framework for thinking about approaches to longevity.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   So if you're interested in things like rapamycin,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.840]   metformin, and whether or not fasting can improve longevity,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.420]   we get into that as well.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.600]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.400]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.060]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.160]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.900]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.760]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.220]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.520]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.800]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.300]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the correct ratios,
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.320]   but no sugar.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.800]   Now, proper hydration is critical
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.480]   for the optimal functioning of all the cells in your body.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.820]   And that's especially true for the neurons, the nerve cells.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.160]   In fact, we know that even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.820]   can diminish both cognitive and physical performance.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.760]   So to make sure that I'm getting proper hydration
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.900]   and electrolytes,
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.040]   I personally dissolve one packet of Element
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.400]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.600]   when I first wake up in the morning,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.320]   and I drink that or sip that
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.480]   across the first half hour of the day or so.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.200]   And then I also make it a point
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.720]   to drink another packet of Element
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360]   dissolved in an equal amount of water,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.900]   so 16 to 32 ounces,
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.400]   at some other point during the day,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.800]   and maybe even a third if I'm exercising
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.200]   and/or sweating a lot.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.680]   I should mention that Element tastes absolutely delicious.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.400]   My favorite flavor is watermelon,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.040]   although I also confess I like the raspberry flavor,
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.920]   the citrus flavor.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.580]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.720]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.600]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.560]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.740]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.480]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.240]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.200]   how different foods impact your health
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.480]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.620]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.020]   One of the most important factors
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.720]   in both short and long-term health
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.480]   is your body's ability to manage blood glucose.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.440]   To maintain optimal energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.860]   you want to keep your blood glucose levels steady
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.120]   without big spikes or crashes.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.800]   I first started using Levels about three years ago
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.960]   as a way to try and understand
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.640]   how different foods impacted my blood glucose levels.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.160]   And it's proven incredibly useful
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.000]   for determining what food choices I should make,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.080]   when best to eat certain foods,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.120]   especially around things like workouts,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.920]   and when and what to eat relative to when I go to sleep
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   in order to allow for the best possible night's sleep
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.420]   and stable blood sugar throughout the night
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.860]   and when I wake up in the morning.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.860]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.340]   and trying a CGM yourself, go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.180]   Levels recently launched a new CGM sensor
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.520]   that's even smaller and has even better tracking
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.780]   than their previous version.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.980]   Right now, they're also offering
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.340]   an additional two free months of membership.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.100]   Again, that's levels.link, spelled L-I-N-K/huberman
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.000]   to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.340]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.040]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.900]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.340]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.780]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.860]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.260]   One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.780]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.180]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.220]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.680]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.380]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.440]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.300]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.260]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.780]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.540]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.140]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.020]   middle, and end of the night.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.880]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.540]   for well over three years now,
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.760]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.020]   Eight Sleep recently launched
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.440]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.300]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.460]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.640]   and it also has snoring detection
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.900]   that remarkably will automatically lift your head
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.020]   a few degrees to improve your airflow
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.160]   and stop your snoring.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.140]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.160]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.320]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.300]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.580]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.140]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.500]   And now for my discussion about NAD and longevity
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.180]   with Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.860]   Peter Attia, welcome.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.820]   - How are you?
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.040]   - Great to see you again.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.540]   - Great to be here again.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.840]   - Should we parse this NAD thing?
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   - I think we should.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.560]   - Do you mind if I set up a little bit of a framework?
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.200]   Great.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.920]   So for people that want to live as long as possible,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.560]   I figure there are at least four categories of approaches,
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.480]   broadly speaking.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.700]   The first I'll just call the do's and don'ts.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.920]   You've talked a lot about these,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.380]   your book "Outlive" beautifully covered these,
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.340]   and I tend to regurgitate some of what you say
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.000]   on this podcast.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.080]   Namely, you want to move appropriately and often enough,
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.640]   so get enough zone two cardio, do your resistance training,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.920]   keep nerve to muscle connection strong,
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.500]   avoid the sorts of things that would lead to falling
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.060]   and being immobile, eat right.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.400]   There's a whole category of things there
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.420]   we're not going to talk about today,
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.160]   although we might touch on a bit.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   And know your genetics and make some good decisions
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.300]   on the basis of your genetics.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.540]   So the do's and don'ts.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:52.300]   The second category I would put under the umbrella
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.660]   of calories, glucose, insulin, et cetera,
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.060]   that all kind of funnel in, at least in my mind,
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.280]   to mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.660]   a molecule that's robustly expressed during development
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.900]   in essentially all cells of the body,
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.400]   and then across the lifespan tapers off.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.180]   During puberty, especially,
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.940]   well, let's say infancy through puberty,
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.580]   cells are expressing so much mTOR,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.140]   and they're growing like crazy.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.340]   And we often associate that early stage of life
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.940]   as youth, not aging, because we think of it
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.900]   as a kind of a timestamp as opposed to the verb.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.720]   But I would argue as a developmental neurobiologist
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.200]   by training that it's one of the most rapid phases
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.680]   of aging of our entire lifespan.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.040]   Look at a picture of you when you were five,
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.460]   look at a picture of you when you were eight versus 15,
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.360]   you look very different and your size is robustly different.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.800]   - By the way, I just did this exercise
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.340]   'cause my daughter, her 16th birthday is around the corner.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.760]   And we take a picture of her every single year
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.680]   at the minute of her birth.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.360]   So we have a picture of her every single year
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.200]   holding a clock that says 3.56, at 3.56 PM,
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.440]   'cause that's when she was born.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.100]   And I just went through and pulled each of the last 16
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.740]   of them from the day she was born all the way up.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.600]   And you're right, the biggest changes
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.760]   are actually in about the first 10 years.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.520]   The difference between being 13 and 14,
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.920]   14 and 15, 15 and 16 becomes incrementally less
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.760]   and less and less.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.840]   Whereas going from two to three and three to four
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.760]   and four to five are ridiculous changes.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.560]   - Yeah, I mean, the brain, the same brain
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.500]   has to learn an entirely new body every year
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.040]   in terms of how to move it, limb length, et cetera.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.200]   So a lot of the so-called anti-aging or longevity approaches
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.560]   that fall under this umbrella relate to things
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.000]   like caloric restriction or taking drugs such as rapamycin.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.040]   And of course, mammalian target of rapamycin
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.300]   is the target of rapamycin, duh.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.840]   In an effort to essentially remove excess insulin,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   blood glucose, and thereby reduce mTOR activity.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.680]   So essentially slow cellular growth.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.560]   And all that fits nicely into the logic
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.120]   that mTOR is associated not just with development,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.680]   but with aging because development is aging.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.760]   And then I would say there's a third category
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.100]   and it's the one we are going to talk about today,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.160]   which is targeting specific cellular pathways
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.480]   that some people have deemed potentially interesting
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.920]   for longevity.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.280]   And the pathway that we're going to spend some time on
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.000]   is the so-called NAD pathway.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.200]   NR, NMN, NAD being the major players.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.920]   And we'll talk about some of the biochemical
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.080]   and enzymatic steps in between.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.440]   And then I suppose there's a fourth category,
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.760]   which we could say is, you know, the do everything,
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.040]   even the most esoteric of things category.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.720]   This is a rarer category.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.120]   There are folks like Brian Johnson
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.960]   who spend a lot of time in this category specifically,
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.800]   you know, taking very high doses of polyphenols,
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.200]   limiting their caloric intake to just early part of the day.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.820]   I think he eats dinner at 11 a.m.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.400]   I don't know if it still qualifies as dinner at 11 a.m.,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.760]   but his final bite of calories is I believe at 11 a.m.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   Doing everything from red light to PRP,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.480]   platelet rich plasma, excuse me.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.840]   And essentially the kitchen sink approach
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.240]   to longevity and aging.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.600]   Did I miss any categories?
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.440]   - So I would frame it slightly differently
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.680]   because I like categories to be more MESI,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.220]   mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.160]   So I don't know that I would formulate it that way, right?
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.680]   I might say, look, category one are sort of
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.220]   the essential behavioral things that you have no choice
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.760]   but to engage in whether you want to or not, right?
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.380]   So you have to eat, you have to sleep, you have to move.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.680]   You just have a choice and do you wanna do those things
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.900]   correctly or not correctly?
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.680]   Or do you wanna do those things in a manner
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.920]   that promotes health or erodes health, right?
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.960]   So again, there's nobody listening to us who doesn't eat,
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.180]   but again, you can choose how much you eat
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.360]   and what you eat and when you eat.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.680]   There's nobody who's alive who isn't moving
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   because locomotion is life and the absence of life
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.240]   is the absence of locomotion.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.640]   But you can certainly choose to move very little.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.800]   You can choose to move a lot.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.440]   And you can choose to decide on how you move.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.600]   You alluded to it already, right?
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.760]   You can move in a certain way that puts your aerobic system
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.960]   in a zone that maximizes fat oxidation.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.880]   We call that zone two.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.560]   You can move at a level where you consume
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.480]   incredible amounts of oxygen at your maximum aerobic level.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.000]   You can choose to move in a manner that uses resistance
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.120]   and gravity against you and all those sorts of things.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.700]   Similarly, we all have to sleep, right?
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.320]   Matt Walker would probably tell us the number of days
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.000]   you could go without sleep before you would literally perish.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.960]   But again, you have a lot of choices in how you do it.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.880]   So anyway, I agree, that's kind of category one,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.760]   but that's kind of the way I would frame it.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.500]   And then I would put in category two,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.720]   sort of what are the molecules that you would
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.560]   exogenously take to try to impact any of those systems?
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.600]   And maybe, and again, I'm not saying my framework
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.640]   is correct and yours isn't.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.400]   I'm just saying this is the way I think about it.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.480]   I would then say, what are the molecules that I could take
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.800]   that specifically target disease processes?
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.760]   So I kind of think of like, if you want to live longer,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.600]   and I described this, I think, in chapter four of Outlive,
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.880]   that turns out to be mathematically equivalent
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.080]   in the modern society to delaying
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.280]   the onset of chronic disease.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.800]   Now, that wasn't true 100 years ago.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.120]   100 years ago, if you wanted to live longer,
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.100]   a few things had to be true.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.080]   You couldn't die during childbirth,
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.460]   'cause that was a huge hit on mortality.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.480]   And then you had to not get an infection
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.880]   or succumb to trauma.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.840]   And then maybe 150 years ago, that was the case.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   But today, most of those things are taken care of
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.000]   by antibiotics, sanitation, and the modern miracle
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   of childbirth in this era.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.400]   So now, for you and I to live longer,
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.360]   we basically have to delay the onset
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.960]   of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.000]   cancer, neurodegenerative disease,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.600]   dementing diseases, and metabolic diseases.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.680]   We have to delay the onset of those things.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.260]   The longer we delay the onset,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.360]   the longer we will live full stop.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.840]   So you can use everything that you talked about
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.000]   in the first category plays into that.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.400]   But you also have this other category
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.900]   of where you can take molecules
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.440]   that specifically target those things.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.040]   You can take metformin, or an SGLT2 inhibitor,
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.760]   or a GLP-1 agonist,
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.280]   and you will directly impact those things.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.560]   You could take a PCSK9 inhibitor,
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.620]   or a statin, or a bempedoic acid.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.880]   You will directly impact those disease processes.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.560]   You will delay the onset of those diseases,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.920]   and you will reduce the mortality associated with them.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.320]   Then I'm gonna go to a third category that says,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.920]   are there exogenous molecules that you can take
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.440]   that don't target a disease per se, specifically,
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.200]   but we're gonna put them in a category
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.120]   called geroprotective,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.280]   which is they target hallmarks and pathways of aging
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.560]   that you've described.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.600]   So we talk about all of these things that occur
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.400]   in an aging phenotype, where we see more inflammation.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.660]   We see a greater abundance of senescent cells.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.080]   We see reduced nutrient sensing capacity of mTOR,
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.160]   which you described as the,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.080]   probably the most important nutrient sensing system
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.920]   in our body.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.200]   So we have these, somewhere between nine and 14,
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.040]   the number just keeps changing arbitrarily,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.900]   but it doesn't really matter.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.840]   We have these central things that everybody would agree
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.480]   define what an aging phenotype is,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.200]   and can we use exogenous molecules
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.880]   to target those specifically?
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.240]   You gave one example,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.400]   which I would argue is the single best example,
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.780]   which is rapamycin.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.660]   So rapamycin targets a very specific hallmark of aging,
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.280]   and we can talk about what the experimental evidence is
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.680]   to suggest that that makes you live longer.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.800]   So I would sort of say those are the big three categories.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.680]   And then basically, the fourth category,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.720]   you could just say is like,
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.000]   how do you put them all together?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.680]   And how aggressive do you wanna be in culminating those?
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.040]   Of course, none of this touches on another area
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.820]   that I wanna talk about that we won't talk about today,
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.880]   which is like, how does all that factor
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.320]   into kind of emotional health and happiness and wellbeing,
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.040]   where none of this other stuff matters
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.320]   if you're kind of unhappy.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.700]   And so you have to,
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.780]   and you've done so many podcasts on that topic, right?
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.180]   You've had Paul Conti on where you kind of go through
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.060]   the understanding of ourselves and our minds,
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.740]   and why that's also a very important part of it,
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.300]   because it actually does impact how long you live.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.340]   Because if that piece isn't working,
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.180]   it's very difficult to regulate the first bucket,
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.260]   'cause the first bucket takes so much work.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.060]   So if you can't regulate yourself,
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.100]   it's very difficult to regulate the do's and don'ts.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.740]   But even absent just length of life stuff,
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.020]   it impacts quality of life,
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.260]   which is this idea of healthspan as well.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.740]   So I guess that's just my slightly different way
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.420]   to frame it, but it's a little bit more Meesey,
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.640]   in that we talk about the behaviors,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.900]   the exogenous molecules that target diseases,
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.720]   the exogenous molecules that target aging.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.660]   - Aside from food, what exogenous molecules do you take?
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.500]   - I take a few, right?
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.180]   So I take some that are disease specific, right?
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.660]   So I take a PCSK9 inhibitor, I take bempedoic acid,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.680]   I take an SGLT2 inhibitor,
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.860]   and then I take at least one that is purely just
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.660]   based on the belief of its capacity and geroprotection,
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.580]   which is risrapamycin.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.020]   And also the SGLT2 inhibitor,
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.660]   I think is probably just broadly geroprotective.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.320]   And we can even talk about that a little bit
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.700]   in terms of the success of one of those molecules
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.100]   called canagaflozin in the interventions testing program,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.340]   the ITP, which I am sure we'll talk about
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.440]   in the context of NAD as well.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.700]   - What dosage of rapamycin do you take?
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.100]   - I take eight milligrams once a week
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.700]   for as long as I can tolerate it,
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.820]   but I usually have to take breaks.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.660]   - Why is that?
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.220]   - I get these vicious apthos ulcers, little mouth sores.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.260]   - Canker sores?
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.100]   - Yes.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.100]   About 10% of people get them.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.740]   It's paradoxically the only biomarker we probably have.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.740]   So I secretly rejoice in knowing
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.420]   that at least I'm getting a good batch of rapamycin.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.260]   - By virtue of the side effect.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.980]   - By virtue of these miserable side effects.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.180]   But so in reality, what it works out to
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.820]   is I'm probably on it for two months
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.220]   and then off it for a month,
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.420]   on it for two months, off it for a month, or thereabouts.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.060]   - And the idea there is that you're limiting mTOR,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.060]   you're causing your cells to grow less, mature slower,
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.700]   and in that sense, slowing down aging.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.100]   Is that the idea?
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.700]   - Yeah, I mean, you know,
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.580]   and this will be an important theme today, right?
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.420]   It's like we can talk all day long about mechanisms
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.100]   and theoretical arguments for why it would work.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.380]   And I think my conviction around taking rapamycin
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.380]   is less about sort of looking at the molecular explanation
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.380]   for why RAPA works,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.300]   although I find that to be quite convincing.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.260]   And why does the inhibition of mTOR stimulate autophagy?
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.500]   Why would that suppress senescent cells?
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.340]   But truthfully, my conviction around mTOR
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.740]   is far more based on the experimental data,
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.460]   something that is actually sorely lacking
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.500]   in the NAD story, which we'll discuss.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.260]   So the experimental data are far more convincing, right?
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.260]   Which is when you look at the administration of rapamycin
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.980]   or its analogs, for example, Everolimus,
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.820]   when you look at the administration of these molecules
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.300]   to organisms that are as close as possible
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.140]   to the species of interest,
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.220]   we're the species of interest.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.220]   So looking at mammals, such as mice and small primates,
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.980]   looking at fruit flies, looking at worms,
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.020]   and even looking at yeast,
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.260]   although that's so far from us that you would argue
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.140]   that's the least important.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.380]   You see something that you don't see
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.500]   for a single other molecule,
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.320]   which is uniform life extension.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.140]   No other molecule has done this.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.540]   It's very important to understand
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.660]   there are only two interventions, full stop,
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.520]   that have ever extended life
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.380]   across those four categories of eukaryotes.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.660]   - Caloric restriction.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.620]   - And rapamycin.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.820]   Very important point, right?
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.580]   - How do you feel when you're on rapamycin,
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.220]   aside from the canker sores?
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.620]   - Yeah, which fortunately aren't that frequent.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.700]   I don't feel anything,
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.140]   and the very few of my patients who take it,
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.060]   because maybe 10% of my patients also take it,
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.020]   I've never heard, actually, that's not true.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.380]   I've probably heard two people say they feel better on it,
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.180]   but I don't know what to make of that.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.100]   Maybe they do, and maybe that's just a placebo effect.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.540]   - Does it synergize with caloric restriction
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.860]   or collide with caloric excess?
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.980]   Meaning if you're taking rapamycin,
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.820]   but you're slightly over your caloric needs,
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.080]   maybe you're trying to add a little bit of body weight
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.820]   or happen to overeat a little bit just because,
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.700]   is it going to collide with rapamycin's potential
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.500]   positive impact on slowing aging?
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.580]   - Yeah, that's a good question, Andrew.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.820]   I don't know.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.540]   I don't think we know.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.340]   We do know that there's one other really important readout
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.180]   we're waiting for,
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.920]   which is Matt Kaberlin's dog aging study,
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.820]   which is gonna be an exciting readout in 2026.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.980]   We're also waiting for another readout
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.700]   out of the University of San Antonio,
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.460]   looking at another trial in mammals.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.460]   And again, I think those two
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.600]   will be really interesting, right?
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.140]   Because we have a ton of,
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.560]   we have just an overabundance of mouse data
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.140]   that are so reproducible,
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.660]   and reproducible in really good mouse models.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.380]   As you know, I'm sure from your work,
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.380]   the model you choose matters, right?
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.020]   And sort of you, in an ideal world,
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.020]   you wanna use a mouse model that is not inbred,
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.780]   that is more closely related to what we care about,
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.100]   which is ourselves.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.900]   And so when you see many labs getting the same result
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.260]   over and over again,
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.340]   regardless of how they do it,
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.300]   you really start to believe there's a signal there.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.100]   So now to be able to see this in a higher order mammal,
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.580]   and ultimately in companion dogs,
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.960]   which is where Matt Kaberlin is looking,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.260]   I think that's gonna be really exciting.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.580]   And I've often said to my patients,
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.100]   "Look, in 2026, I'm either gonna feel
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.020]   "a lot more conviction about taking rapamycin
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.340]   "and prescribing it to some of my patients,"
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.900]   though, again, not most,
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.180]   "or I'm gonna have a second look at this and say,
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.300]   "maybe we just shouldn't be taking this," right?
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.860]   'Cause I do think that the dog study
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.720]   is gonna be more telling.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.700]   But again, we'll have to wait and see what that shows.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.760]   - Without going off track too much,
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.940]   my understanding is that the dog study was halted
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.460]   because of a lack of federal funding.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.540]   Is it continuing?
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.980]   - It is going to go on.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.820]   There's, yeah, it's...
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.140]   So initially, there was kind of insufficient funding
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.400]   to do the study in an adequate way.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.580]   And then it turned out there was a shortfall
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.140]   of about $2.5 million to do the study
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.620]   that Matt really wanted to do.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.060]   And then, actually, a group of us
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.900]   raised that money for Matt and did that.
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.860]   So me and a few of my patients
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.820]   and a couple of other folks came together
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.140]   and put the money in to close the gap.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.580]   But yes, there has been...
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   What did get pulled back by the NIH inexplicably
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.380]   and, in my view, totally incorrectly
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.880]   was the ongoing surveillance program,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.760]   the funding for the ongoing surveillance program
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.440]   that would allow this type of work to continue
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.340]   and to allow greater follow-up on this.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.920]   So yes, unfortunately, until we can get more funding,
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.660]   we're not gonna be able to maybe do as much
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.700]   as we'd like to do and understand this.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.820]   Which, again, when you look at some of the things
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.260]   that are funded, it's hard to believe
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.380]   that there's not a more interesting question right now
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.500]   in biology than this drug that seems so promising.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.780]   Why we wouldn't want to know
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.380]   if this is something we should all be taking
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.500]   is kind of a mystery to me.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.420]   - Yeah, I was on NIH study sections for many years
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.260]   reviewing grants.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.260]   I rotated off as a regular member a little over a year ago.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   And I can tell you that the whole process
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.700]   is designed to be as targeted to the best
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.180]   and most exciting work possible.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.620]   But there's a number of features now that make it such
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.220]   that it's largely the work that's already mostly completed
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.060]   that gets funded.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.580]   You don't even know, like, how does that work?
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.260]   But anyway, we could have a whole other
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.720]   journal club discussion about funding,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.340]   but I had to ask, I was curious.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.020]   So hopefully that study will get completed
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.940]   and thanks for raising those funds.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.100]   Let's talk about NAD.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.420]   - Yes.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.080]   - It's in essentially every cell of the body
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.340]   except red blood cells, correct?
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.780]   - You know, I don't even know if it's in red blood cells.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.740]   My intuition is, I've never looked to be honest with you,
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.500]   but given that red blood cells
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.180]   have a different metabolic pathway, right,
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.860]   where they're purely glycolytic,
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.100]   they wouldn't have the need for it
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.980]   in the way that others would, but they might, right?
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.380]   'Cause they still undergo redox potential.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.240]   So it's possible NAD is in every single cell, yeah.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.580]   - And it's generally thought to be associated
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.140]   with energy production and mitochondrial pathways
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.460]   in every single cell.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.100]   - Right, so NAD is, again,
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.820]   one of the most ubiquitous molecules in the body
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:45.060]   and most of what it does, and I mean most,
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.940]   meaning like somewhere between five and 600 pathways of it,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.100]   utilize NAD as a cofactor,
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.740]   meaning that it's not consumed in a chemical reaction,
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.180]   but rather it serves as an electron shuttle.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.180]   So NAD and NADH basically play catch with electrons.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.740]   And that's 99% of what NAD is doing in the body.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.740]   And for that reason, NAD is so tightly regulated
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.160]   in the body.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.940]   The levels of NAD in the cell are really tightly regulated.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.540]   And that shouldn't be surprising.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.860]   Just as glucose, really tightly regulated.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.780]   pH or hydrogen ion concentration, really tightly regulated.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.140]   We as a species cannot survive
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:38.020]   outside of a very narrow band of pH, right?
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.920]   If it's below seven or above 7.8 on a zero to 14 scale,
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.140]   we die, full stop.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.020]   So similarly, NAD is managed across all ages
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:54.020]   and across all physiologic conditions in a super tight band.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.920]   There's another place where NAD shows up,
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.740]   and that shows up as a substrate, right?
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.900]   So cofactor means used coenzyme,
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.100]   used but not consumed, recycled.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.100]   That's 99% of it.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.820]   A small fraction of it is used.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.940]   And it's used by these things called sirtuins
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.840]   that consume NAD as an actual substrate
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.940]   in the process of DNA repair.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.260]   And maybe we can go into this,
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.500]   but this is really where the story picks up.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.700]   - It's also, as I recall, where the story began.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.520]   - That's exactly right.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:33.000]   It was some experiments where the sirtuins were mutated
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.520]   in one direction or the other,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.680]   meaning gain of function or loss of function.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.600]   These days, people hear gain of function
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.240]   and they immediately think to pandemic-related themes.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.500]   But gain of function is a way of changing genes,
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.500]   typically to augment a function, increase its robustness,
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.520]   or in some cases to rescue a phenotype
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.320]   where you have a knockout mouse that lacks a gene,
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.480]   so that's loss of function,
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.400]   or a strain of yeast that lacks a gene,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.080]   and then you do the gain of function rescue experiment.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.400]   You reintroduce the gene of interest.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.520]   It's an important, I wouldn't even call it a control.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.400]   It's an important experiment in any case
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.900]   because loss of function will tell you a lot.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.380]   But gain of function and loss of function,
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.200]   assuming that the results jive, tells you much, much more.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.120]   This is one of the major areas,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.200]   I think this is very important to highlight,
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.600]   where human genetics really struggles
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.000]   because you can get humans with a mutation
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.360]   in a particular pathway,
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.560]   like I don't know, the sonic hedgehog pathway.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.760]   Somebody is hypomorphic for sonic hedgehog
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.780]   and they might actually lack a major tooth up middle
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.580]   because the role of sonic hedgehog at the midline,
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.160]   and you could say, okay, well, loss of function here,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.520]   here's the role of sonic hedgehog.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.360]   But the ideal experiment is to put the gene back in
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.640]   and then rescue that phenotype
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.560]   because as any logical mind can tell,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.440]   there could be many things downstream of sonic hedgehog
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.660]   that could create the phenotype that you observe.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.680]   But if you put sonic hedgehog back in,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.600]   yes, that's still true,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.000]   but you get more reassurance
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.800]   that that's the gene of interest.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.960]   So with respect to sirtuins,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.800]   as I recall, they deleted the sirtuins in yeast.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.960]   - Let's use another example
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.300]   of what the gold standard is here
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.640]   or what a great example is.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.960]   So I recently did a podcast with Dina Dubal
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.000]   from UCSF on clotho, which is an amazing scientific story.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.760]   And it's a great story because it shows
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.180]   how accidents can lead to great discoveries, right?
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.400]   So there was a researcher in Japan
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.280]   who was really interested in understanding hypertension,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.760]   high blood pressure, and they had created a mouse model
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.580]   where they were trying to knock out certain sodium channels
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.240]   to see if they could perturb blood pressure.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.400]   And then there was this one strain of mouse
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.800]   with this one knockout that died really, really quickly.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.920]   And it developed like devastating neurodegenerative disease
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.960]   and died very quickly.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.080]   And like a good scientist, he didn't say,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.880]   well, that sucks, I'm gonna discard that one
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.220]   'cause it didn't give me what I wanted,
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.440]   which was the blood pressure change.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.100]   And he kind of went and figured out what was going on.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.080]   And he figured out that there was a certain gene
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.000]   that he had hit that wasn't a sodium transporter
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.360]   and instead was this other gene.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.080]   He named it clotho.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.120]   So you had this one piece of evidence right now,
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.720]   which was if you knock out that gene,
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.600]   you kill an animal very quickly.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.520]   Now that doesn't mean it's a longevity gene.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.880]   You have to do the other experiment to your point.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.000]   You have to overexpress that gene and ask the question,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.280]   do you live longer?
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.120]   And sure enough, when they overexpress that same gene
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.380]   that they had just knocked out and killed the mouse,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.680]   the thing was living 15 to 20% longer.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.720]   - So it's both necessary and sufficient for extended life.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.540]   - Yeah, so that's how you can say,
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.240]   well, that's a longevity gene.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.440]   - As many of you know, I've been taking AG1
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.000]   for more than 10 years now.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.480]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.240]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor,
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.340]   rather they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.760]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day,
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.480]   and I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.040]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.220]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.200]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.560]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.240]   a vegetarian or a vegan,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.440]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.960]   that you should get most of your food
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.480]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.040]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.080]   probiotics and micronutrients
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.500]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.300]   Now, I personally am an omnivore,
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.840]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.640]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.600]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.320]   and often twice every day,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.820]   is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins,
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.960]   minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.800]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.060]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.760]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.000]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.040]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.760]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.360]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.400]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.540]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.960]   So while many supplements out there
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.120]   are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.880]   AG1 is foundational nutrition
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.040]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.560]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.960]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.400]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.840]   to claim a special offer.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.960]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.560]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.760]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.980]   - So let's go to the sirtuin story.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.480]   So it goes back to the late nineties.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.540]   Matt Kaeberlin again, this is amazing, right?
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.200]   So you have this guy who's like the leading authority
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.280]   or one of the leading authorities
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.200]   on the work going on today with rapamycin,
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.600]   along with one of his colleagues,
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.380]   David Sabatini and a few others.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.120]   But when Matt was a postdoc,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.480]   he did an experiment in a strain of mice,
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.320]   pardon me, a strain of yeast.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.280]   I think it was the W3O3 strain of yeast.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.100]   And he over-expressed SIR2.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.500]   And lo and behold, the yeast lived longer.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.920]   Now, a year later, someone else in the same lab
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.680]   took a different strain of yeast
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.960]   and calorically restricted them,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.560]   and they also lived longer.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.800]   I forget the name of that.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.080]   I forget what that strain was.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.780]   It was something 316 was it,
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.760]   but it was a different strain of yeast.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.040]   At that moment, again, this is about 25 years ago,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.720]   a hypothesis emerged,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.220]   which was we have two different strains of yeast.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:31.480]   And in one of them, when you over-express SIR2,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.760]   this gene, they live longer.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.600]   And in this other strain,
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.080]   if you calorically restrict them, they live longer.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.960]   The understandable hypothesis was caloric restriction,
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.560]   which we had known was life-extending,
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.200]   is working through sirtuins.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.820]   That hypothesis sort of fell apart about four years later
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.560]   when Matt Kaberlin, again, this time with Brian Kennedy,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.200]   did another experiment in a different,
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.160]   yet a third strain of yeast
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.520]   that allowed them to test hypothesis,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.600]   because there was a problem with the story I just told.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.800]   When you took the 303 strain,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.480]   this is the strain that when over-expressing SIR2
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.200]   lived longer, if you took that strain
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.620]   and you calorically restricted them, no change.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.800]   That's odd.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.880]   Even more odd is when you took the 316 strain,
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.640]   and this is the strain that lived longer with CR.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.420]   If you over-express SIR2, no change.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.040]   So right off the bat, the story didn't make sense,
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.560]   but it was further solidified
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.320]   that that story didn't make sense
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.160]   when Brian and Matt published in 2004
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.720]   in yet a different strain.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.700]   God, I'm blanking on the name.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   It's like BY4742, like, you know, these don't matter.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.040]   If you calorically restricted them, they lived longer.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.960]   If you over-express SIR2, they lived longer.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.720]   If you did both, they lived even longer.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.260]   It was additive.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.620]   Again, further suggesting that over-expression of SIR2
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.660]   and caloric restriction independently
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.980]   and separately extended lifespan.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.580]   These are parallel pathways.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.900]   They're parallel pathways.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.580]   For reasons that honestly escape me, Andrew,
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.280]   there are still people who maintain
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   that the benefit of SIR2 and over-expression
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.540]   is through the caloric restriction pathway and vice versa.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.420]   And that's wrong.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.220]   My reading of the literature,
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.960]   in addition to every person I have talked to on this
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.980]   who works in the space, including Matt Kaberlin,
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.340]   who has done the most research on this,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.380]   is that there is no evidence that caloric restriction
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.740]   and sirtuins operate through the same pathway.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.540]   And in that sense, I think there's relatively
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.660]   uniform agreement that caloric restriction extends life
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.700]   across the model systems we discussed.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.620]   - What about in humans?
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.020]   - What about it specifically?
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.580]   - Does it extend life?
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.060]   - Well, that experiment's never been done
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.380]   and never will be done.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.700]   - The joke I was trying to set up for
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.540]   is the one I'll make now,
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.820]   which is no one wants to be in the control experiment.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.660]   That said, nobody wants to be in the--
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.860]   - I would argue nobody wants to be
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.700]   in the treatment experiment either.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.100]   - Oh, you got me, you got me.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.660]   You beat me to the punch.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.580]   No one wants to be in the treatment group either
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.940]   because it requires eating so little.
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.180]   It just, the mere appearance of people--
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.380]   - The joke is you probably will live longer
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.700]   and it will feel even worse.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.580]   Like it's just, it's, yeah.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.620]   Caloric restriction, which by the way,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.180]   there are real debates about whether
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.620]   it will extend life in humans
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.180]   because it will clearly, I shouldn't say clearly.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.140]   I think it would be a very safe bet
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.060]   that severe caloric restriction
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.540]   will absolutely reduce the risk of most chronic diseases.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.100]   Meaning I have, I think there's very good reason
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.700]   to believe that if an individual
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.380]   constitutively consumed 25% fewer calories
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.840]   than they were meant to eat,
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.460]   their risk of cardiovascular disease,
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.100]   cancer, Alzheimer's disease would go down.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.240]   The problem is what things go up.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.220]   What does that do to your immune system?
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.620]   What does that do with respect to sarcopenia?
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.140]   What does that do to your risk of falling?
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:07.980]   - Yeah, frailty.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.860]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.820]   So you trade one set of diseases for another,
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.580]   it's not at all clear that lifespan goes up.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.580]   And by the way, when you even look at some of the wild,
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.100]   like some of the animal literature
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.860]   where they're using different strains of mice
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.160]   that are not inbred and they don't put them
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.960]   in hermetically sealed situations, they don't live longer.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.580]   So it's not always the case that caloric restriction
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.820]   extends life.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.940]   And therefore, well, it's safe to say caloric restriction
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   probably reduces the onset of chronic disease
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.800]   that might not translate to an all-cause mortality benefit
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.820]   based on those downsides.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.460]   But all of that said, I think the holster two in story
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:52.940]   got off to an incorrect start where it basically
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.260]   lopped on to the CR story, which was,
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.260]   hey, we've got this thing CR that we've known since--
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.100]   - Caloric restriction.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:58.940]   - Right, caloric restriction.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.980]   We've got this thing, which for 50 years,
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.100]   we've known has a signal that really says
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.460]   it's life extending.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.380]   And we've got this yeast where it works
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.300]   and this other yeast where sirtuin activation works.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.320]   Oh, it's gotta be sore.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.740]   But again, if you go through the story in detail,
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.560]   as I just did, there's no evidence whatsoever
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.780]   that sirtuins have anything to do with caloric restriction
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.620]   and vice versa.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.800]   - It's incredibly interesting because I think
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.300]   when you look at cell biology
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.500]   and you see these parallel pathways,
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.100]   when you see these effects of experiments
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.340]   where changing sirtuins or changing caloric restriction
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.140]   independently increase lifespan, combine the two,
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.920]   you get this, what appears to be a synergistic effect,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.940]   but it's, as you pointed out, an additive effect.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.540]   It's like a pretty straightforward experiment to do.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.860]   You could just do an occlusion, right?
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.780]   You could then put back in the sirtuin
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.500]   or adjust calories and see whether or not you get the,
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.980]   effectively, whether the math is corrected, you know?
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.460]   So--
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.820]   - Now, none of this gets to the question you raised yet.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.680]   That's just all, that's all prologue, right?
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.380]   That's like, where did this story come up?
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.740]   But then the question becomes, well,
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.940]   if you believe that sirtuins are truly
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.820]   a factor that drives longevity,
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.060]   how can you activate them, right?
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.820]   How do you activate a sirtuin?
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.020]   So we have to now simultaneously start to hold things true
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.380]   in parallel that may or may not be true.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.180]   So we want to then ask the question,
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:32.500]   do we believe that what we saw in yeast,
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:37.220]   which I think is the only reproducible finding I can draw,
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.140]   meaning this is a reproducible finding,
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.940]   in many but not all strains of yeast,
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:46.300]   if you overexpress sirtuins, the yeast will live longer.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.580]   So let's park that in the parking lot
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.480]   as a very likely statement.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.500]   You would then say, well, if it does it in yeast,
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.800]   does it do it in flies?
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.000]   Does it do it in worms?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Does it do it in mammals?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.440]   You want to be able to check those three boxes,
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.760]   because again, that's a billion years of evolution.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.000]   So if something works across a billion years,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.880]   we'd be much more confident it works in us.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.760]   - Yeah, making a fly mutant, Drosophila mutant
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.960]   that overexpresses sirtuins,
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.840]   a worm C. elegans mutant that overexpresses sirtuins,
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.360]   that's a pretty quick experiment to do
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.400]   because of this short generation time of those species.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.960]   Now, a mouse, it's a longer experiment,
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.200]   but I'm guessing all of those experiments have been done.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.320]   - Yeah, and the only one that I can find
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.260]   that has demonstrated a survival advantage
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.340]   is one particular transgenic mouse experiment
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.720]   that overexpressed SIRT6,
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   and it did indeed, for the male mice,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.760]   increase lifespan by 10 to 15%.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.600]   So this is one transgenic mouse model
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.640]   that overexpressed SIRT6,
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.840]   and the male mice lived 10 to 15% longer.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.320]   The female mice did not.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.920]   - We should probably clarify what a transgenic mouse is.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.500]   I talked about knockout mice.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.280]   That's when a gene, or genes in some cases,
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.280]   is deleted from the genome.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.040]   So it's null, it does not express that gene.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.840]   The gain of function would be to put back that gene in.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.060]   That would be a knock-in mouse.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.280]   So in that case, you still get some normal expression
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.100]   of the gene from the endogenous genome,
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.420]   but now you have a transgene that's inserted there.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.540]   And there are all sorts of important intricacies
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.580]   that relate to this.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.900]   For instance, where the transgene is inserted.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.500]   If it's downstream of an enhancer that's muscle-specific,
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.660]   then you can get a mouse
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.020]   that overexpresses SIRT2 and it's just in muscle.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.540]   You can get it ubiquitously expressed.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.220]   There are a number of different ways that this can happen.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.620]   I'm assuming this was ubiquitous expression of,
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.780]   you said SIRT6?
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:47.620]   - SIRT6, yeah.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.980]   - So every cell in the body
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.580]   that normally would express SIRT6
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.140]   would express more SIRT6.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.820]   - I don't remember, Andrew, to be honest with you.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:54.900]   I'd have to go back and look at the paper.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.340]   I don't know if it was muscle-specific
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.780]   or whole body-specific.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.920]   - I'm guessing unless they made it clear
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.140]   that it was tissue-specific, that it's whole body.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.240]   So we're talking about it,
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.860]   when Peter says transgenic mouse,
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.140]   he's talking about a mouse that has this transgene
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.420]   that causes it to express more SIRT2 and SIRT6
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.820]   than it ordinarily would.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.680]   And let's assume, although we don't know this for sure,
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.160]   that the other genes in this mouse
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.140]   are functioning as they would normally.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.100]   - Right.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.140]   So again, just to summarize that, that's 2012.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.780]   We have this one transgenic mouse.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.460]   You put SIRT6, you overexpress SIRT6,
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.300]   and all of a sudden, the males were living 10% longer.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.140]   Again, to be clear,
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.520]   the females didn't experience a difference.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.740]   And that's not uncommon or unheard of in longevity research.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.380]   There generally are sex-specific differences,
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.400]   and you always have to read the fine print.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.180]   The first thing I always look at in a study,
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.100]   when I see a difference in sexes,
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.740]   or frankly, any difference in longevity,
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.740]   but it's always great when they parse them out by sexes,
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.260]   is how long did the controls live?
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.860]   But I went back and actually looked
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.780]   at the Kaplan-Meier curves on that exact study.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.080]   And yes, indeed, I think that's a real effect.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:07.340]   So let's take stock of now two pieces of information
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.820]   that I think we could say is probably true.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:14.120]   It is probably true that in a handful of strains of yeast,
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.120]   if you overexpress SIRT, you are going to live longer.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.240]   That tends to be completely independent
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.200]   of caloric restriction.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.680]   That's the single thing I can say
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.120]   with the greatest confidence.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.280]   And there is at least one transgenic strain of mice
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.400]   that if you get it to overexpress, a different SIRT6,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.720]   but again, these are homologs throughout the species,
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.520]   so I don't think we need to get wrapped up
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.840]   in SIRT2 versus SIRT6.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.020]   You will at least make the male mice live longer,
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.740]   but not the females.
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.340]   - What sorts of things are downstream of SIRT2-ins?
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.280]   And that question translated to normal English
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.780]   is what is changing as a consequence
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.060]   of increasing the SIRT2-in?
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.340]   Could it be, for instance, well,
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.900]   unlikely based on what we already know
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.260]   about caloric restriction and the fact
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.800]   that they are independent parallel pathways,
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.500]   but is it something related to glucose metabolism?
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:09.160]   Is it something related to clearance of senescent cells?
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.660]   I mean, I'm just throwing out possibilities here.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.020]   - Actually, you've hit two of the big three
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.140]   right off the top, right?
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.700]   So we believe that when SIRT2-ins are activated,
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.140]   they're improving mitochondrial biogenesis.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:25.500]   They are increasing DNA repair.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.140]   So that's probably the biggest one.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.620]   And by the way, that's sort of what brings us
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:33.620]   to the NAD story.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.660]   And also reducing SASPs, right?
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.860]   So the soluble products of senescent cells.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.460]   So in other words, those are all three good things, right?
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.740]   So you tamp down on senescent cells,
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.900]   you increase mitochondrial biogenesis,
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.700]   and you increase DNA repair.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.340]   Those would be all great things to do,
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.940]   and we think that SIRT2-ins are probably doing all of them.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.940]   - This business of DNA repair and reducing, you know,
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.740]   fragmentation or mutations to DNA
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.900]   that are naturally occurring has been a hot idea
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.180]   in the field of aging for a long time.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:11.460]   Is that because when x-rays became popular
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.100]   or post-nuclear fallout
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:19.140]   that people showed accelerated signs of aging?
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.100]   I mean, how did we get from DNA mutation
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.740]   to accelerated aging?
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:29.020]   - Well, I mean, I think we know that as we age,
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.900]   it's just a stochastic process, right?
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:34.620]   Like given the ubiquity of DNA replication
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.180]   and the fidelity of the system,
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.620]   which is high, very high, but not perfect,
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.500]   there's going to be mistakes.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.780]   Actually, this is an interesting question.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.420]   So in 2016, I went to Easter Island
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.900]   with David Sabatini and Nav Chandel and Tim Ferriss.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.780]   So the four of us just took a trip to Easter Island
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.540]   to see the birthplace of rapamycin.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.820]   So it was kind of like vacation slash science journey.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.780]   - That's a nerdy vacation.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.500]   - It was awesome.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.060]   And so just picture hiking around this incredible island,
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.740]   just talking about science all day.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.180]   But this was an interesting question
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.100]   that I posed to Nav and to David,
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.100]   which was, why do we see such a clear
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.860]   and present association with cancer as we age?
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.740]   And why is it so non-linear?
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.100]   So it's not just that cancer goes up with age,
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.580]   it goes up like that.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:28.820]   And I said, I'll offer two hypotheses,
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.460]   which is more compelling.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.460]   Is it simply that as we're aging, DNA replication,
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.020]   again, taking a step back for the listener,
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:39.860]   cancer is a genetic disease.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.860]   Meaning by definition, it is sort of the canonical problem
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:47.380]   with cancer is a genetic mutation
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.900]   that leads to two properties of a cell,
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.660]   the inability of the cell to control replication.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.580]   So it interrupts cell signaling.
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.020]   So cells replicate, but then don't know when to stop.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.220]   And then the introduction of the capacity to spread,
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.980]   this property called metastasis.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.940]   Those are the two hallmarks of cancer.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.940]   So we know that that only happens
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.900]   in the context of genetic mutations,
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.340]   but why does this happen later in life
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.700]   and not at the beginning of life with very few exceptions?
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.180]   And so the question is,
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.580]   is it because over time mutations compound?
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.420]   Is it because there are more mutations as we age?
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.500]   Or is there a third issue, which is all of those things
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.020]   are happening normally, and they're no more abundant
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.620]   when you're 80 than when you're 20,
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.740]   but your immune system can't detect them as well.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.860]   And the truth of it is we didn't come up with an answer,
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.020]   but it's probably all of the above.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.260]   So it's probably that as we're aging,
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.660]   we are undergoing more DNA damage,
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:47.980]   and or at a minimum, the DNA damage we're undergoing
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.860]   is less amenable to repair.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:51.780]   And that's part of the thesis here.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.120]   Part of the thesis here is as we're aging,
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.300]   we are less and less able to repair DNA.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.260]   And one of the arguments that put forth,
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.260]   although we're not quite ready for this part of the story
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.060]   yet, but I'll just say it now and we'll come back to it,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.060]   is we don't have enough of the substrate
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.060]   that the sirtuin needs to repair DNA,
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.220]   and that substrate is NAD.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.700]   So again, remember at the outset I said,
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.860]   look, there's two big categories to think about NAD.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.380]   Most of what NAD is doing is operating as a cofactor
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.540]   for electron shuttling.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.960]   That's the NAD, NADH, electron transport,
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.480]   electron accept, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   Okay, not consuming NAD,
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.680]   just using it to pass electrons back and forth.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.240]   But then over here, we have this other category
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.080]   where we use NAD as a substrate, it gets broken down,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.800]   and that's what the sirtuins are doing to repair DNA.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.600]   Okay, so if that's true,
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.280]   and if NAD levels are declining with age,
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:50.280]   it's a logical conclusion that should we give more NAD?
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.720]   If you're running out of substrate to repair DNA,
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.440]   and DNA repair is an important way to thwart aging,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.800]   it all makes sense.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   So we'll keep that over there.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.240]   But before we do, I wanna come back to one other story,
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.180]   which is the story of sirtuin activators.
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:08.760]   So what's the most famous sirtuin activator of all time?
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.120]   What is the heavyweight champion of sirtuin activators
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:16.680]   that has taken up 99% of the bandwidth in this space?
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.800]   It's a lovely little chemical called resveratrol.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.360]   Okay, so resveratrol,
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.840]   which gained a lot of fame and notoriety
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.100]   because it happens to be found in trace elements
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.440]   in the skin of grapes, and therefore shows up in wine,
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.840]   gained a lot of notoriety about 20 years ago
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:38.320]   when one lab doing one experiment
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.440]   somehow was able to convince some people,
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.520]   including a very large pharma company,
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.240]   that resveratrol increased lifespan.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.000]   So the thesis was, resveratrol activates sirtuins.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.760]   Sirtuin activation is important
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.480]   because of all the things we just said, right?
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.280]   It improves mitochondrial biogenesis,
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.880]   it suppresses senescent cells,
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.520]   and it enhances DNA repair.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.840]   So if you have something
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.160]   that is such a potent activator of sirtuins
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.640]   and you give it to a mouse, that mouse should live longer.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.800]   Now, lots of experiments were done that couldn't find that.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.400]   But one experiment was done,
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   but it was an interesting experiment.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.700]   I've discussed this at least on two podcasts,
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.280]   including one with Rich Miller,
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.600]   who runs the ITP, the Interventions Testing Program,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.200]   which later tested resveratrol
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.120]   and found that it did categorically nothing.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.920]   In this one experiment that worked,
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.420]   the investigators took a bizarre mouse model
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:43.320]   where they force-fed it an enormously high-fat diet.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.800]   And in doing so,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.840]   they created such an abundance of fatty liver
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   that the livers of these mice encroached the chest,
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.580]   the thoracic cavity of the mice.
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:51:00.580]   So the mouse died prematurely because they couldn't breathe.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.800]   And in that particular mouse model,
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.360]   resveratrol rescued the mice.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:11.640]   So again, let's just assume that all of that is correct.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.400]   And it's possible that there were even errors there,
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.680]   but let's just assume that's correct.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.520]   Let's assume.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.920]   - So this is resveratrol delivered orally in the food?
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.760]   - Yes.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.640]   - Very high doses.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.840]   - Mega doses.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.840]   - The equivalent of barrels of grape skin.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.960]   - Exactly, like doses so high you could...
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.880]   If you recall,
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.360]   we're both of an age that's old enough to remember this.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.280]   There was this period of time when people thought
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.080]   this was the explanation to the French paradox, right?
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   Why on average do the French live longer
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.500]   when they consume so much wine?
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.440]   And the answer was, it's got to be the resveratrol.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.020]   It turns out that's not true at all
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.760]   because yeah, you would need to be drinking your body weight
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.680]   and wine a day to get the doses of resveratrol
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.220]   that were needed to produce this effect.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.400]   But for whatever reason, there was an effect,
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.400]   which is if the thing that was going to kill you
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.120]   was your liver being so full of fat
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:04.120]   that it shot up into your chest so you couldn't breathe,
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.760]   which I've never seen a human,
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.640]   no matter how bad their fatty liver has been,
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.760]   where that's been the case.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:12.300]   But if that's the problem you're going to face,
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.180]   it's possible at least based on this one mouse experiment
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.180]   that you are gonna live longer.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.220]   But again, it turned out
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:21.100]   that there was no other replication of this
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.860]   in mouse models that matter.
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.900]   And that always comes back to the ITP,
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.780]   the Interventions Testing Program,
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:32.180]   which is the most robust tool we have scientifically
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.860]   to measure these exogenous molecules.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.100]   So the ITP is an NIA funded program
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.400]   that runs out of three independent labs.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.240]   And by independent,
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.720]   I mean they're each doing the experiments independently,
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.680]   but they're in sync with doing the experiment,
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.440]   but they're doing it in triplicate.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.680]   So you have three labs,
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.020]   three great labs doing the experiments in triplicate.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.920]   And when they did the resveratrol experiment,
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.800]   and they did it in combination with the people
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.040]   who found the result of that study.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.080]   So they consulted these people and said,
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.280]   "What dose should we give?"
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   And they said, "Do this, do this, do this."
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.920]   And they did it and nothing.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.640]   There was no effective resveratrol.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.820]   And that result has been consistent across the board.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.860]   So that's also a very important part of the story,
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:20.120]   which was if resveratrol was a SIRTU inactivator,
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.960]   and I don't know if it really is,
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.320]   it clearly has no effect on lifespan
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.400]   with the one little asterisk that says,
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.000]   "Unless your body weight is 50% fatty liver."
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.800]   Then maybe it does.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.520]   - I'd like to take a quick break to let you know
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.520]   that the Huberman Lab team has launched a new podcast
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.760]   with host Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.040]   Andy is an expert in exercise science and human performance,
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.640]   and has long been a fan favorite
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.520]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.240]   This new podcast is called Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.040]   And it dives into topics such as
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.840]   how to build muscle and strength,
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.040]   how to improve your cardiovascular health,
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.100]   and how to optimize recovery and sleep
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.240]   for performance and much more.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:01.760]   Andy is an absolutely fantastic educator
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.680]   and true expert on all things human performance.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.840]   I know you'll thoroughly enjoy his new podcast
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.480]   and learn a ton of useful knowledge from it.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.060]   So please check it out and give it a subscribe
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.840]   wherever you're watching or listening to podcasts now.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:19.280]   Again, the podcast is called Perform with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.680]   - So let's see, let's just take stock
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.200]   of where we are in the story.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.720]   We've got the whole yeast SIRTU in situation,
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.280]   which is at least in some yeast,
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.400]   SIRTU in overexpression lives longer.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.680]   No evidence that that works through caloric restriction.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.720]   Truly no evidence.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.040]   That's been known for 20 years now.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.880]   That paper was published in 2004.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.400]   And that was a follow up to papers
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.520]   that had been published in 2002 to 1999, et cetera.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:50.180]   Later on, you'd have the 2012 transgenic mouse study.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:54.560]   So now the question is, okay.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.720]   - How do you activate SIRTU?
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.560]   - How do you activate SIRTU?
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:59.800]   Well, yeah, so, or more to the point,
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.240]   why don't we just give people NAD?
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.120]   Okay, so again, the NAD story is,
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   NAD levels are declining with age in most tissues.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:17.480]   It appears most prevalent in the skin of all places.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.600]   And I think we should come back to this
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.760]   'cause there's one interesting finding
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.800]   associated with augmenting NAD levels in the skin.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.760]   And my thought is, I wonder if it has to do
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.660]   with the fact that skin experiences
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.980]   the greatest decline in NAD.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:36.080]   - It's also interesting because keratinocytes in skin
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.880]   turn over every 28 days or so.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.780]   So you could imagine,
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.840]   because it's a novel population of cells,
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   that they would have steady expression of SIRTUins and NAD.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:50.440]   Then they simply die for whatever reason,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.840]   or that it starts off very high on day one of generation
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.960]   then tapers off quickly.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.880]   But that's not the case.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.440]   It sounds like, you know.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.160]   - On average, skin over the course of your lifetime
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.480]   will see about a 60% reduction in NAD.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.440]   Whereas other tissues,
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.880]   and this is now based on animal studies,
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:11.640]   the brain might see a reduction by 15 to 20%.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.840]   And the same would be found
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.600]   even in humans looking at the blood.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:19.040]   So if you just sample whole blood in people
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.120]   at the age of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80,
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.040]   you're gonna see about a 20% reduction in NAD.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.000]   - What about neurons?
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   I mean, you've got the same set
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.920]   of central nervous system neurons your entire life.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.640]   And of course, some peripheral neurons as well,
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.660]   but there's some regeneration in the periphery.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.760]   So we need to discuss, let's just talk about brain.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.480]   So unless you're talking about the olfactory bulb,
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.040]   where you have constant turnover throughout the lifespan,
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.880]   you have the same hippocampal neurons,
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.040]   except a small population.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.680]   Same hippocampal neurons, cortical neurons, retinal neurons
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.220]   that you were born with.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:49.920]   Are we observing NAD levels tapering off as we age?
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.800]   - In animals, yes.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.840]   Obviously in humans, we're not doing that experiment.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:53.680]   But yeah.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.400]   Now, here's an interesting point.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.600]   In 2015, a study was published in PNAS
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:05.080]   that looked at NAD levels in whole blood over time.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.840]   And it found indeed, NAD levels were going down
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:12.200]   about 10 to 20% over four decades or so.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.480]   But that same study said NADH levels
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.260]   were going up by the same amount.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.240]   - Explain the role of NADH for people.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.800]   - NADH is the electron acceptor.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.040]   So when you, so let's maybe take a step back
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.720]   and like, how do we, why are you and I sitting here talking
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.840]   and not dead?
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.520]   - Like, 'cause we have enough NAD.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.340]   - Right, right.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.180]   What's going on, right?
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.600]   So you and I ate something at some point
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.360]   in the foreseeable past that contained chemical energy.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.240]   So we ate something that was organic.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:49.240]   So it had, so primarily fats and carbohydrates
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.040]   contain carbon-carbon bonds and carbon-hydrogen bonds.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.960]   And those bonds contain a ton of energy.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.040]   But how do we liberate the energy?
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.960]   So we break it all down into these constitutive molecules,
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:02.600]   namely glucose on the carbohydrate front
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.920]   and free fatty acids on the fat front.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.240]   And then our bodies break those things down further
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.840]   into smaller molecules that get shuttled
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.320]   into the mitochondria where the lion's share
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.640]   of our energy liberation comes from.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:20.200]   And what we do is we take that chemical energy
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.000]   that is stored in a carbon-to-carbon bond
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.760]   or a carbon-to-hydrogen bond,
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.200]   and we turn it into electrical energy.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.400]   And people have heard this term,
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.320]   it's called the electron transport chain.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.960]   So there are these four complexes in the mitochondria
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.160]   and there's an inner membrane and an outer membrane
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:40.160]   across which these large mitochondrial complexes reside.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.480]   And what they're doing is they're building up
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.320]   a huge electron gradient by breaking them apart
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.440]   and taking the electrons and transferring them
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.720]   between NAD and NADH so that at the end,
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.080]   they can do another trick,
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.520]   which is transfer those electrons to a MP, ADP,
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.180]   and ultimately make ATP.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:04.600]   The finished product is water and carbon dioxide.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   So we eat and we take that chemical energy and food,
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   we utilize oxygen in the mitochondria to make ATP,
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.460]   carbon dioxide, which we breathe out,
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.280]   and water, which we breathe and pee out.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.640]   So what NAD and NADH are doing
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:25.660]   is playing an absolutely essential-to-life role
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:29.920]   in facilitating the transfer of chemical energy
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.080]   to electrical energy back to chemical energy.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.840]   ATP is just taking it from one chemical form in food
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.600]   to the electrical form as the intermediary
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.240]   in the mitochondria back to an electrical form of ATP.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.540]   So you and I are walking around flush with ATP,
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.280]   which as we sit here right now,
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.980]   we're constantly firing off phosphates,
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:51.920]   again, now turning the chemical energy
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.980]   back into electrical energy and away we go.
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   So yeah, this whole NAD, NADH thing is like,
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.580]   it's as central to our existence as any form of respiration.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.280]   So my point, let's go back to the story.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.360]   The story was NAD levels are going down as we age,
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.400]   but NADH levels are going up,
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.880]   suggesting that the total amount of NAD and NADH is the same
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.560]   and what's declining as we age
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.920]   should less be thought of as a reduction in NAD
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.000]   and should more be thought of as a reduction
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.840]   in what's called redox potential,
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.360]   the ability to do what I just said.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.000]   So when people say NAD levels decline with aging,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.440]   the answer is, yeah, but what's really declining as we age,
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.160]   and this kind of comes back to what you said
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.200]   at the very, very outset,
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.160]   like what's happening at the cellular level,
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.960]   I think what's happening is our mitochondria
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.200]   are not as good as we age and we have less redox potential.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.080]   And I would say a fair number
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.100]   of so-called anti-aging approaches
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:53.100]   are targeting the so-called reactive oxygen species, ROSs,
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.680]   which impede mitochondrial function, essentially.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.280]   This is an opportunity for me to call out the work
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.960]   that I think is at least intriguing,
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.600]   which is the work of a colleague by the name of Glenn Jeffery
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.440]   at the University of College London.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.120]   He's been in the field of visual neuroscience
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.320]   for a very long time.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.280]   And a few years back,
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.540]   he started doing some experiments on animals
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:15.920]   and now also two studies published on humans
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.240]   showing that exposing the aged eye, so 40 and older,
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.000]   to red light and near-infrared light for a couple minutes
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   a few times a week can spare certain processes
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.400]   involved in vision, photoreceptors.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.240]   How does this work?
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.080]   Well, the idea, this isn't proven yet,
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.560]   the idea is that it's reducing reactive oxygen species
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.500]   and thereby improving mitochondrial function
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.140]   in what is perhaps the most metabolically active cell type
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.100]   in the entire body, not just the eye,
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.940]   which are the photoreceptors.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.500]   So it's an intriguing set of studies.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.420]   Again, we don't have all the mechanisms worked out,
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.220]   but it brings us around again to this idea
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.180]   that mitochondria are vitally important
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.180]   for the functioning of cells.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.940]   Things that impede the function of mitochondria
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.140]   can either reduce the output of and/or kill cells.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.920]   And so anything that can improve redox
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.960]   can potentially keep a cell around longer,
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.120]   functioning better.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.440]   So when I hear about the role of NAD in this pathway,
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.680]   I think like most people, I think, okay,
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.480]   well then I should just take more NAD
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.080]   and maybe I will age more slowly,
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.320]   or I will replace some NAD that's missing as I age
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.540]   in whatever cell type.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.920]   Turns out that might not be so straightforward, right?
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.040]   I mean, I don't want to jump to supplementation just yet.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:38.880]   - Yeah.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.680]   - But if we are to back up from NAD a little bit
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.080]   and look at the pathway leading to NAD,
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.080]   it's NR, NMN, and NAD, we'll spell these out in a moment.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:54.180]   And this sort of competition that's out there in the market
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.860]   is around either infusing,
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:01.740]   or in some cases, ingesting NAD directly,
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:07.440]   taking NMN, which is the precursor to NAD orally,
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.800]   I haven't heard of anybody infusing it,
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.800]   or taking oral form NR, which is the precursors to NMN.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.420]   My understanding is that NMN is simply NR
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.960]   minus a phosphate group.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.360]   - Yeah, and I'll take a step back from this first
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.520]   to say the following.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.520]   Again, because this topic is so confusing,
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.840]   I think it's just worth reminding everybody
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.000]   of what we now, everything we've said
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.160]   and where it brings us, right?
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.260]   So I'm not going to repeat the whole sirtuin thing,
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.600]   let's just leave that alone.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.880]   - Because everything we're on right now
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.280]   is upstream of sirtuins.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.920]   - Yeah, it's basically like once you establish
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.000]   that we think sirtuins matter,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.140]   even though they don't work through caloric restriction,
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.320]   and that's about the single most obvious thing I can say,
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.840]   they might still matter,
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.360]   even though we don't have things that we figured out
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.480]   can activate sirtuins, like resveratrol,
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.120]   we don't seem to have things that we can give you
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.440]   that activates sirtuins,
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.800]   we're now onto the next part of the story,
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.240]   which is, okay, sirtuins matter,
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.280]   they don't seem to matter,
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.480]   we think sirtuins matter
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.920]   because of a few of these overexpression experiments,
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.120]   and we're making a big leap
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.140]   that because they mattered in yeast,
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.840]   they're going to matter in us,
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.200]   that's a huge leap for which there's zero evidence.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.320]   - Right, and I'm only leaping further
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.120]   to this discussion about how to increase NAD
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.080]   because I know that's in the back of people's minds,
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.000]   we're not going to double click here just yet,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.400]   I just want to frame that up
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.760]   because ultimately that's where we are headed
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.840]   in terms of people making decisions
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.960]   as to whether or not they should take NR,
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:40.760]   or take NMN, or use NAD, or none of the above.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.320]   - And the reason I'm being such a hard-ass
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.400]   about this, Andrew,
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.120]   is I spend so much time fielding questions on this
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.320]   that I realize we just have to talk about this
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.720]   in excursion, in the most detailed fashion possible
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.040]   so that people understand why,
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.320]   because it is just too easy, right?
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.240]   There's this great quote by JFK
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.280]   that I'm going to paraphrase
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.280]   that is basically people enjoy the comfort of opinion
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.240]   without the discomfort of thought, right?
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.640]   So we need to sort of,
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.080]   this is a podcast to get people to think
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.760]   and understand the entire history of this field
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.440]   so that they can actually make an informed decision
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.520]   about a supplement that I'm going to argue
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.960]   has very little scientific basis for its justification.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.600]   - I would say scientific justification for longevity.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.040]   I'll go on record now saying that I take NMN,
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.240]   and in some cases I will take NR and NMN,
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.120]   and I observe,
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.480]   this is just N of one self-observational data,
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:46.760]   I observe a very clear positive effect,
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.480]   but I don't think it has anything to do
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.760]   with extending lifespan.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   - And we should talk about both healthspan
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.000]   and lifespan benefits when we get to that part,
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.960]   but to bring us up to where we are now,
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.000]   where you are with, should people be supplementing NAD,
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.320]   we're basically at the point
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.720]   where we're taking a lot of leaps of faith
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.720]   and saying, because NAD levels are going down
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.720]   and redox potential is going down,
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.640]   we believe supplementing NAD
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.680]   in one form or another makes sense.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.820]   But before we do that, we should acknowledge something.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.440]   Yes, NAD levels are going down,
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.880]   but we have no reason to believe
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.300]   that raising NAD levels will correct a problem.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.600]   In other words, if the body operates
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.840]   between this level and this level of NAD,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.500]   and if you go below this level, you die,
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.840]   and you go above this level, you die,
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.080]   and levels as you age go like this,
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.700]   do we believe that raising them to this does anything?
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.880]   There's no evidence that says it does.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.360]   So that's a leap of faith.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.920]   It's okay to take leaps of faith,
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.820]   you just have to know you're taking a leap of faith.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.600]   Okay, so leap of faith number one is,
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.440]   the sirtuin thing.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.360]   Leap of faith number two is the caloric restriction thing.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:04.040]   Leap of faith number three is this matters in our species,
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.040]   the species of interest.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.880]   Leap of faith four is the whole sirtuin activator thing.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.980]   And now this leap of faith is,
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:14.440]   if we just increase NAD levels in us,
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.600]   it will produce a positive benefit.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.480]   Okay, so now how do we do that?
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.120]   Now you get into the tactic.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.720]   Okay, there were three ways to do it, as you said.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.760]   One is you can intravenously take NAD.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.000]   By the way, you could probably also orally take NAD.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.680]   It would just break down in the gut
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.560]   into its constitutive products and then probably reform.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.720]   But for the purpose of how people actually do this,
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.480]   they intravenously get NAD
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.640]   because it's not orally bioavailable.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   Or as you said, they orally take two precursors, NR and NMN.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.040]   My personal view on this is,
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.920]   there's not really much of a difference in what you do.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.680]   In other words, at the end of the day,
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.960]   all of these things are generally going to increase
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.600]   NAD levels in the blood.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.260]   - So a couple of kind of practical notes.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.280]   I've taken NR in capsule form.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.540]   I've taken NMN typically in powdered form
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.340]   where I put it sublingually under the tongue.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.180]   My understanding is that--
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.920]   - Have you done intravenous NAD?
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.760]   - I sure have.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.980]   - Did you experience a niacin flush?
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:24.980]   - No, I took NAD as an infusion.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:27.500]   I've probably done it five or six times.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:32.500]   And for the first 10 minutes of the infusion,
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:36.180]   you feel like somebody's stepping on your chest with a boot.
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.880]   Your legs cramp up, you feel nauseous.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.700]   I did not take the anti-nausea med that was offered.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.500]   I don't like taking things if I can avoid it.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.060]   I just figured I'll just experience this.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.100]   It was very uncomfortable
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.940]   to the point where you couldn't read a paper or a book.
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.460]   You just wanna be left alone.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.940]   You actually get a little bit irritable.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.720]   You're like, this is awful.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.980]   Every noise in the room is a bit too loud
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.500]   during that first 10 minutes.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.340]   And then--
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.180]   - By the way, do you know how many people have said to me
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.040]   that because of that experience,
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.620]   they know it must be doing something good?
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.780]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.220]   - To which I'm like, why don't you spread your legs?
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.220]   Let me kick you right in the nuts.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.000]   That's gonna feel even worse.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.140]   Is that doing something good?
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.460]   Like the fact that something feels so awful
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.460]   shouldn't be used as an explanation
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.540]   for why it's doing good physiologically.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.620]   - Right, I don't know what it was doing physiologically
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.060]   except making me feel miserable during the infusion.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:26.980]   There are ways to adjust this
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.540]   even without the anti-nausea meds.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:32.260]   For instance, you can slow the infusion.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.800]   That's the typical way.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.060]   People will put it in over the course of several hours,
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:41.580]   anywhere from three hours to as brief as 30 minutes
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.760]   is kind of the record that I've heard about
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.220]   for 500 milligrams of NAD.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.740]   If you put 1000 milligrams in there,
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.660]   obviously it's more painful and you have to,
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.520]   anyway, there are a bunch of practical considerations.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.540]   You feel, now maybe it's placebo,
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.940]   but one feels quite good afterward.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.340]   So as soon as the drip is done,
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.940]   you feel better than you did prior to the drip.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.420]   - How do you feel if you just receive an IV infusion
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:09.620]   of the same volume?
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:13.020]   - I've done that because I've received saline drips.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.140]   You also feel pretty good.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.700]   It's hard to disentangle these things.
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:21.020]   And typically they'll put other things in the bag,
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.540]   glutathione, some vitamin C.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.160]   They tend to sell these as kits.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.540]   I decided to try it.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:27.380]   It seemed fine.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.940]   I did it when traveling.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.220]   I don't know, maybe I'm due for another one soon.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.700]   But for me, the more typical way
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.100]   to try and increase NAD or whatever,
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.820]   because I don't know what it's doing exactly,
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.660]   but I like the effects of taking sublingual NMN.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.940]   The single most, let's say salient to me,
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:48.140]   anecdotal data on taking sublingual NMN
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.500]   is that it makes my hair grow really fast.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.100]   It makes my nails grow really fast.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.260]   And I do feel an increase in energy.
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.780]   And I take it first thing in the morning.
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.620]   - And what dose?
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:01.080]   - One and a half grams, 1,500 milligrams.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:01.920]   So-
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.580]   - By the way, if you translate the doses
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.620]   that they give mice in the studies
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.580]   where they're testing the efficacy
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:14.300]   are typically on the order of 500
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:17.120]   to 1,000 milligrams per kilogram.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.340]   - Whoa.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.160]   - Yeah.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.020]   - I'm a hundred kilograms.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.660]   - Yep.
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.740]   - Whoa, okay.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.220]   - So picture that the next time
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.900]   you're giving yourself some NAD or NR.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.740]   - I'm not even approaching that at all.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.540]   Well, it's clear to me based on my read of the data
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.220]   that NR can cross the cell membrane directly.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.660]   - Directly, very easily.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.980]   There's no obstacle to NR getting into cells.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:45.820]   - Okay.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.180]   And NMN cannot because of the extra phosphate group.
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.620]   So that if you take it sublingually
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.900]   or you ingest it orally, it goes into the gut.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.060]   The phosphate group is cleaved.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.900]   And because of that, the argument is that
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:02.740]   if one were to compare the benefits of taking NR versus NMN,
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.940]   there are more data to support NR as a precursor to NAD,
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:11.620]   a more effective precursor to NAD than orally ingested NMN.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.580]   But some people will say,
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.900]   "Well, I'll just take more NMN than I would NR."
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.620]   And then this gets into the realm of cost effectiveness.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.860]   - It's just a commercial issue.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.540]   - It starts becoming a battle between commercial sources.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:27.540]   And I don't dispute that NR makes more sense as a precursor,
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.620]   especially at dosages of 300 to 600 milligrams
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.700]   versus 1,500 milligrams.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:37.900]   But I've opted to take sublingual NMN
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.540]   mostly based on cost.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:44.020]   NR at the dosages people recommend is quite expensive.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.400]   - Imagine you had to take it at the mouse doses.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.240]   - Right.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.900]   - You'd be spending about 300 bucks a day.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.860]   - Right. It's just, it's not feasible.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.340]   It's just not feasible.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.900]   So, you know, I don't have a deep desire
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.760]   for my hair to grow faster or my nails to grow faster.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.520]   It's more the increase in energy effect.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.960]   Now, I will say that sublingual NMN
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.320]   is also a bit of a laxative.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.400]   So there are all these, and I say that, you know,
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.960]   somewhat chuckling, but, you know,
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.940]   some people say it makes them feel better.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.860]   Well, is that because you're, you know,
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.800]   evacuating your bowels a few minutes or hours later
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.720]   and then you feel less bloated and you have more energy?
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.340]   You know, it's very unclear.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:23.760]   I think what has not been done, as far as I know,
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.680]   is to compare orally ingested NR at say 600 milligrams,
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:32.680]   a relatively high dose, versus a gram of sublingual NMN,
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.240]   and then actually measure blood levels of NAD.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.480]   If that experiment has been done and I'm not aware of it,
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.120]   I'm not aware of it, then forgive me.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.880]   Maybe someone will put it in the show note captions.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.920]   But I guess this gets down to the question
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.600]   of how many people are taking oral NR or NMN,
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.240]   or are taking NAD infusions,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.280]   which by the way are quite expensive,
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:59.200]   anywhere from $300 to $1,000 a drip.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.000]   That's pretty expensive.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:01.840]   - Think about that.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.680]   - What benefits are they getting?
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.200]   Like, what are they getting out of this?
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.040]   Like, what are they getting?
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.060]   Is it an acute increase in NAD that, that what?
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.440]   That causes them to live, what, a week longer?
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.320]   I mean, we have no idea.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.340]   - So let's try to use data to answer the question, right?
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.800]   So this is exactly the thing that the ITP,
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.300]   the Interventions Testing Program, was designed to test.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:25.300]   And again, I would, if people are interested in this,
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.180]   they should go back and listen to my two discussions
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:30.220]   with Rich Miller, where we go through gory detail
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:33.060]   of every molecule that has gone through the ITP.
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:37.660]   The ITP is hands down the most rigorous tool we have
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.140]   for testing molecules in anything other
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.420]   than the species of interest,
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.600]   because we can't do these experiments in human.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.500]   We cannot test lifespan interventions in humans
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.780]   for the obvious reasons.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.460]   So what is the next best thing?
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:53.440]   Well, it turns out it's doing it in a non-inbred mouse
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.940]   in triplicate in three institutions.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.460]   Like, you can't get more rigorous than this.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:03.260]   The ITP has tested probably north of 50 molecules,
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:06.020]   meaning it has done the same experiment
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:08.420]   for 50 different molecules,
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.740]   and very few have extended lifespan.
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.820]   And the notable failure is NR.
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:17.900]   NR was tested, and I believe it was tested
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.620]   at a very robust dose,
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.860]   either 500 or 1,000 milligrams per kilogram,
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:25.600]   and there was no extension of life.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.000]   There was no improvement in healthspan.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.300]   There was no change.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:35.300]   Megadose NR, placebo, same result.
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:39.200]   Conversely, let's consider some of the successes
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.660]   of the ITP, rapamycin.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.860]   When you give rapamycin, the first time they did it,
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.180]   because they had a hard time formulating the rapamycin,
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.260]   they weren't able to start it
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:51.440]   until the mice were like 21 months old,
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.740]   which is very old for a mouse.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.740]   That's like a 60-year-old mouse.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.900]   And at that point, they almost aborted the experiment
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.900]   because they were like, well, what's the point?
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.840]   Nothing is gonna work when you start this late,
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.780]   including caloric restriction, by the way,
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:04.580]   although it has worked in one experiment.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.780]   But nevertheless, it worked.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.680]   And when you gave RAPA that late in life, it still worked.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.820]   Then they redid the experiment and they gave it earlier.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.860]   It worked.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.140]   Canagaflozin, as I mentioned, which is an SGLT2 inhibitor,
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:16.980]   it worked.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:21.860]   Acarbose, a drug that inhibits glucose absorption, worked,
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:24.140]   and interestingly, didn't require weight loss.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.860]   So the thesis behind giving Acarbose to the mice was,
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:31.100]   it's a caloric restriction memetic, a CR memetic,
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:36.100]   and it worked, but the treatment mice weren't any lighter
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.740]   than the non-treatment mice,
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:39.820]   which actually goes back to something you said
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.900]   at the very outset,
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.660]   which suggested that tight glycemic control,
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.620]   independent of weight, is a longevity benefit.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:50.580]   The same was true with the SGLT2 inhibitor, Canagaflozin.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:54.020]   SGLT2 inhibitors cause you to pee out more glucose.
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.500]   Acarbose prevents you from absorbing in your gut.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.620]   So two different ways to regulate glucose.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.740]   Neither of those experiments resulted
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.700]   in a lower body weight for the mice,
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.020]   and yet they both lived longer.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.060]   Again, there's something very important
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.080]   about regulating blood glucose.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:13.080]   The other thing that worked is 17-alpha estradiol,
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.220]   and it only worked in male mice.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.820]   So again, suggesting that, well, we can come back to that.
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.660]   It's more than we wanna get into at the moment.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.740]   But the point here is, there are very few molecules
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.660]   that have withstood the scrutiny of the ITP.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.380]   It's a high-bart metformin failed, by the way.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:36.220]   - And the ITP is specifically for offsetting aging.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.380]   Is that right? - It is lifespan,
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.140]   but it also looks at some measures of healthspan.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.180]   But it's primarily,
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.820]   it is the gold standard for lifespan, yeah.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:46.300]   - Because my understanding is that there are some studies
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.100]   that have explored the role of supplemented NR,
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.100]   maybe NMN as well, but certainly supplemented NR,
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.660]   for sake of lowering inflammation
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:57.740]   to offset some of the negative effects
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:01.140]   of time zone shift, alcohol.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:05.940]   I have a few others listed here, overnutrition.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.220]   - Yeah, so let's talk about that.
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:11.100]   So in 20, I don't remember what year it was.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.020]   It was somewhat recent.
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.740]   A study was published looking at NR
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:18.820]   with something called terastilbene.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:22.740]   So terastilbene is believed to be a sirtuin activator,
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.460]   like resveratrol.
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:27.180]   So commercially available product called Basis,
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:32.140]   and it was tested, it was a three-arm study in humans.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:35.100]   Roughly 30 people per arm, so decent-sized study, right?
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:35.940]   This is a big study.
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.660]   So you take 100 people, more or less,
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.260]   with fatty liver disease.
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:45.260]   Now, this was documented with an MRI of the liver.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:50.460]   So they're looking at hepatic fat in the liver by MR,
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.340]   and using this type of MRI,
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.820]   if your hepatic fat index is over 5%,
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.820]   that's a high enough degree of what's called steatitosis
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.980]   that you have fatty liver disease.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:08.820]   Now, of course, this is not a digital thing.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:09.700]   It's an analog, right?
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.140]   There's a spectrum to this.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.380]   So you start with just fat accumulating in the liver,
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:16.260]   but as more and more fat accumulates,
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.780]   you start to get inflammation
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:20.580]   that results in scarring and fibrosis,
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:22.220]   and ultimately, you would get to cirrhosis.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.580]   So just keeping in back your mind,
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.500]   the threshold at which we would say
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:30.740]   you're in the danger zone is once you hit 5%.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.660]   So this study randomized people to either a placebo
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.420]   or a regular dose of this product
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.060]   or a double dose of the product,
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.860]   and I can't remember exactly how much is in the product.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.200]   I think it's either 250 or 500,
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.740]   so then that would be what the regular group got of NR,
[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:48.700]   and then the other group was getting 2x that.
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:51.760]   So it's either 250 and 500 or 500 and 1,000.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:52.600]   I don't recall.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.380]   They also looked at something called the...
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.840]   They looked at many things, right?
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.700]   So they looked at all sorts of biomarkers,
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.340]   and the primary outcome for the study was,
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:09.960]   did you see a reduction of this hepatic fat via the MRI?
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.100]   So what happened?
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.760]   So they did the study,
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.340]   and lo and behold, there was no difference.
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.780]   There was no difference in anything, okay?
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.020]   So at high dose, at low dose,
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:23.740]   there was no difference in how much hepatic fat
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.980]   you had at the end of the study.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:27.000]   There was no difference in body weight.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.180]   There was no difference in inflammatory markers.
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:31.860]   There was no difference in glycemic markers,
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:35.000]   glucose levels, liver function tests, any of those things.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.740]   So in that sense, it was a null study,
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:42.140]   but they did one sub-analysis,
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.180]   which, again, you have to be very careful of,
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:48.160]   'cause a sub-analysis is not a primary outcome,
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.340]   but it's kind of a way to go and parse the data,
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:55.660]   and they did find one statistically significant finding,
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.440]   which was if you limited the analysis
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.300]   to people who had a hepatic fat score below 27%,
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.860]   remember I said, once you're above 5%,
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.060]   you have fatty liver disease,
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:14.060]   well, they had people anywhere from 10% to 40%.
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:18.620]   But if they looked at people who were below 27%,
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:20.620]   in the low-dose group,
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:24.720]   there was a statistically significant reduction in liver fat.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.280]   If it sounds like I'm machinating, I am.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.820]   Let me say it again.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.080]   If you limited the analysis to people
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.020]   who had below 27% on this hepatic fat index,
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:40.200]   the people who got the full dose had no difference.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.540]   They averaged 20% at the beginning of the trial
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.200]   and 19% at the end,
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.760]   no statistically significant difference.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.800]   The placebo group averaged 20% at the beginning,
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.840]   20% at the end, but the single dose of the drug
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:58.440]   went from 20% to 15%, which was statistically significant.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.660]   It's not clear that that's clinically significant,
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:04.120]   which is a pretty consistent theme in this type of research.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.880]   Never confuse statistical significance
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.520]   with clinical significance.
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   If I gave you, if your blood pressure is 160 over 100,
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:19.480]   and I give you a drug that lowers it to 157 over 97,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.320]   that could be statistically significant
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.320]   if the variance is small enough
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.760]   between people in this study.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.560]   It has no clinical significance.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.560]   I haven't changed the course of your life.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:37.560]   So again, that to me is one of the two big findings
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.680]   that people point to to say,
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.440]   aha, there was some benefit
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.960]   in fatty liver disease with this.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.640]   But again, when you read the fine print,
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.960]   which I just vomited out to you,
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.680]   I don't think anybody's looking at that going,
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.880]   oh, we just found the solution to NAFLD.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.080]   The second study that people point to a lot
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.280]   was 2021 or 2022.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.080]   This came out of a group at Wash U, I believe,
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   and they looked at NMN, and they looked at glucose disposal.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.900]   So in this study, they asked the question,
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:11.320]   we're gonna take two groups of people,
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.800]   you're gonna get a placebo for a period of time,
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.040]   or you're going to get NMN for a period of time,
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.080]   and we're gonna then do what's called
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.000]   a type of glucose challenge,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.120]   where we look at how well you dispose of glucose
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.040]   with and without insulin infusion.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.640]   And in the placebo group,
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.960]   you would look at pre and post,
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.120]   so pre and post placebo treatment,
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.920]   was there a difference in glucose disposal
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.000]   with no insulin?
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:42.880]   No.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.040]   What about with insulin,
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.280]   where you would expect to see much more glucose disposal?
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.520]   No difference.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.720]   But when you did that with the NMN group,
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.480]   there was a statistically significant increase
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.840]   in glucose disposal with insulin infusion,
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.200]   but it was quite small.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.680]   In other words, it was clinically very insignificant.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.080]   And just to make,
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.520]   just to sort of figure out how insignificant it was,
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.640]   I went back and actually looked
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.400]   at some of the red light data,
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.840]   'cause there's an interesting study
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.320]   that shines red light on a person's back,
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.560]   and then does an oral glucose tolerance test.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.020]   Yeah, and you can actually reduce
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.480]   like postprandial glucose by 8%.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.120]   Is that meaningful?
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.220]   Not really.
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.560]   I mean, not in this patient population,
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.360]   because these people were all pre-diabetic
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.600]   and they had very high glucose.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.720]   So it was against,
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.560]   another example of something
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.640]   that was statistically significant,
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:29.840]   but not clinically significant.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.220]   And the same thing was true in this study, right?
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.260]   But again, people would probably point to these two studies
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:37.840]   because they're in humans,
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.180]   and you had this one,
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.240]   if you squint and look really hard
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.520]   and take a sub, sub, subset of the analysis
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.420]   on this one measurement,
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:50.420]   we saw a response of hepatic fat going from 20 to 15%,
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.980]   which is still three X above the threshold
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:54.300]   to have fatty liver disease.
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.420]   And in this other study,
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.400]   you had this very, very modest reduction,
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.920]   pardon me, increase in glucose disposal.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.660]   But I mean, like we're,
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:06.900]   you know, there's a saying in my sort of mind, Andrew,
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:08.460]   which is like, if you have to resort
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:10.800]   to really interesting statistical machinations
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.740]   to see something,
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.880]   there probably isn't something very interesting there.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.080]   - Right, right.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.040]   I totally agree.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.300]   And I think, you know, at this point,
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.360]   I'm questioning whether or not I'm wasting my money
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.060]   taking NMN or NR.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.360]   The reason I take NR is really for these anti-inflammation
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.200]   reported purported effects.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.640]   I just want to pay a little bit of attention
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.940]   to the whole commercial battle around this,
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.480]   because I think it's relevant.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.280]   I mean, I think right now,
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.920]   as far as I know, the FDA has essentially said
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.640]   that NMN should not be sold as a supplement,
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.140]   but it is still being sold as a supplement.
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:55.140]   So there's a little bit of ignoring of the FDA's request.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.520]   NR, as far as I know,
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.840]   is authorized for sale as a supplement.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.120]   - Yeah, so it's generally regarded as safe.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.800]   It has an FDA designation of GRAS,
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.200]   which means it is not regulated.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.280]   It's generally recognized as safe.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.120]   - Right.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.920]   And so that means anybody can sell it.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.480]   The FDA will have no oversight.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.280]   They're not telling you whether,
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.920]   they're not gonna put a stamp on it
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.640]   that says what they're selling is what it is.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.840]   And you can't make a claim about it
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.400]   that isn't validated by some sort of study.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.080]   So honestly, Andrew,
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.920]   I think the whole NMN, NR debate is irrelevant.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.920]   I think it's just a commercial debate.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.020]   I think it's literally just posturing
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.560]   about how can I carve out a different market?
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.720]   I don't think there's a scientific reason
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.280]   to favor one over the other.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.840]   - Well, you just answered the question I was going to ask,
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.540]   but I suppose the question therefore becomes,
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:56.360]   is there any benefit to taking either of them
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.240]   for sake of lifespan and health?
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.100]   - There's one benefit I could find.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.760]   There's one benefit I could find that I think is genuine.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.240]   There are a few other really insignificant ones
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.700]   that fall into the category of goofy studies
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.120]   that cherry pick by data mining.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:13.160]   Okay, so there's studies that like gave people NMN
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.960]   and looked at a shotgun approach of many different things.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.360]   Like, did it change LDL cholesterol,
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.840]   HDL cholesterol, triglycerides?
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.520]   And the answer is, oh, look, there's a small decrease,
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.640]   but it was totally insignificant clinically,
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.080]   even if statistically significant.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:29.160]   And oh, it increased your six minute walking test
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.640]   or whatever, and it's like a six minute walk test
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.320]   or whatever in people who were in their 20s is irrelevant.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.160]   It had no change in VO2 max.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.200]   It had no change in any meaningful metric of performance.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.800]   One test, one study I could find
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.060]   that actually had what looked like a signal to me.
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:51.740]   And it was a study that looked at skin cancer rates
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:55.540]   with, and I can't remember if it was NR or NMN,
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.300]   but honestly, I don't think it matters
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.940]   'cause I think they're basically equivalent.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.460]   - One's just got a phosphate group on there.
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.840]   You might need to take a little bit more
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.780]   of the NMN versus NR, or maybe a lot more, who knows,
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.980]   in order to get the same increase in NAD,
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:11.860]   is my understanding.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.580]   - So this one study found somewhere between a 60
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.140]   and 80% reduction in basal cell
[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:18.940]   and squamous cell carcinomas.
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.840]   Now, it found no difference in melanomas.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.820]   So again, you know this
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.540]   'cause you just did a podcast on this.
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.940]   Melanoma is the skin cancer that kills you,
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:28.500]   but that's not to say that squamous cell
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.820]   and basal cell carcinomas aren't problematic.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:33.920]   They can be very deforming.
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.720]   They can require pretty aggressive surgeries
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:37.560]   to address them.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   And so if indeed there is something
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.280]   that can reduce the risk of basal
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.120]   and squamous cell carcinomas,
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.560]   that may be a rationale for taking it.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.760]   - And I should say that basal
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.760]   and squamous cell carcinomas are very, very common.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.040]   - They're very common and they are very clearly associated
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.560]   with sun exposure in a way that even melanoma
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.760]   is more complicated and has a genetic component
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.000]   and there are other things going on.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.640]   But squamous and basal cell carcinoma
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.980]   are very clearly related to sun exposure.
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.340]   As you said, they're quite common.
[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.460]   And so, you know, personally,
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:09.020]   that's an experiment I would like to see repeated
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:14.020]   because if indeed NR and or NMN reduce the risk
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.940]   that significantly of squamous cell
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.660]   and basal cell carcinomas,
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:20.940]   I think you could make a case
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.520]   that if you're an individual
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.640]   who's at risk for those things,
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.680]   clearly I'm not, right?
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.780]   Like I've never had a sunburn in my life.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:28.700]   I mean, I don't work outside.
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:30.260]   So it's like, it wouldn't matter to me,
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:31.380]   but there are a lot of people
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:34.560]   for whom either their skin color makes them more susceptible
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:39.540]   or their pastimes or frankly their line of work
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.940]   makes them more susceptible.
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.820]   You know, maybe there is a case to be made for it there.
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:47.140]   If you could literally take 60 to 80% of your risk away
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:49.340]   on squamous or basal cell carcinoma, that could matter.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.140]   And by the way, I don't know if this is true,
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:53.460]   but you may recall at the outset,
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.780]   the outset I said that
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.860]   when you look at all the tissues in the body
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.740]   where we see a reduction in NAD,
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.940]   do you remember what had the biggest reduction?
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:02.300]   It was skin.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:04.460]   So there's a part of me that wonders like,
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.960]   is the reason that the only place
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.460]   we see a really good signal potentially
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:14.140]   for NR and NMN supplementation is in a skin cancer?
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.420]   Although it's not melanoma,
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.000]   which is the one we'd really wanna see.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.400]   I mean, if this reduced the risk of melanoma,
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.780]   I would take it, right?
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.180]   'Cause even though I'm dark skinned,
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:22.880]   I'm still susceptible to melanoma.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.020]   So I just wonder, that could be true, true and unrelated,
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.940]   but that's the first thought that crossed my mind
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.020]   when I came across that literature was,
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:34.460]   I wonder if the enormous reduction in tissue, NAD,
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:35.860]   in this particular tissue,
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.460]   explains why maybe there is a benefit to it.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:41.660]   - Assuming somebody is averse to feeling like
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.580]   they have an elephant stepping on their chest
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:48.160]   and they're going to pay $750 for it,
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.100]   AKA an NAD infusion once a week.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:53.860]   And look, people may opt to do that,
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.500]   people with a disposable income could do that,
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.300]   drip it in slower, not feel nauseous,
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.040]   increase NAD with the hope, hope, hope,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.700]   that maybe it's going to extend your life.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:05.420]   Most people considering supplementation
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:08.820]   to augment the NAD pathway are going to default
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:11.300]   to either taking NR or taking NMN.
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.740]   - By the way, just going back to the group
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:17.300]   that have decided that $1,000 for an NAD infusion
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.280]   and dripping it in over two hours
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.240]   is a good use of their time.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.460]   What do you think would be the improvement
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.660]   in their lifespan if they spent
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:27.820]   that two hours exercising?
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:29.000]   - Significantly greater.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.780]   - Interesting, all right, just noting.
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:33.620]   And less expensive, but yeah.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:37.240]   - You could also weight train for the first hour
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:39.900]   and then enjoy some food afterwards.
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.380]   Lane Norton taught me that there are data
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:45.540]   showing that exercise in particular resistance training
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:48.900]   improves the rewarding properties of food,
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:50.580]   makes food taste better,
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.660]   which we've all kind of intuitively experienced.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:55.340]   So you spend the first hour working out,
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:56.300]   second hour eating.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:57.900]   - If you had an extra two hours a week
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.220]   to choose between paying a thousand bucks
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.860]   or 700 bucks for an NAD infusion,
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:05.540]   or lift weights for an hour,
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:06.900]   go for a half an hour walk
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.360]   and listen to your favorite podcast,
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.420]   like the Huberman Lab,
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.340]   and then eat a meal for half an hour.
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:14.620]   I can just think of so many better ways
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.880]   to spend time and money.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.460]   But anyway, let's not digress.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:21.740]   - Okay, well, I'm going to pull a little bit
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.620]   from marketing text here,
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:28.900]   but I trust these showing--
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:29.740]   - Really?
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:31.620]   - Yeah, yeah, I do.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.740]   Because they have citations to support them
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.380]   and we can include the citations.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:40.060]   I can say these are not linchpin arguments
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.300]   for doing one thing or the other,
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:45.740]   but we already established that NR and NMN
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:47.500]   are quite similar except for the presence
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:50.100]   of a phosphate group on NR that gets cleaved off.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.380]   So again, you might have a slight dose issue,
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.940]   but at the end of the day,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.340]   you're giving NR, NR is freely taken up into cells,
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:58.460]   it turns into NAD.
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:01.780]   So this is all a big sort of shell game
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:03.140]   of how do you get NAD up.
[01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.860]   And again, I think we've established
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:09.860]   and we can agree that there is an increase in NAD,
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:13.580]   at least in the blood and probably in the liver
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:17.220]   when you take exogenous NAD or a precursor.
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:18.420]   Let's pause at that. - Or NR.
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.780]   - Yeah, that's what I mean, a precursor, right?
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.220]   - Great, well then you took the words right out
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.780]   of the data I was going to refer to.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:26.060]   Because I asked a few folks that helped develop
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.620]   some of the NR supplements,
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:31.100]   like what are the data that support the use of NR
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:31.940]   for increasing NAD?
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:34.900]   And they say, NR can cross the cell membrane directly,
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.740]   NMN cannot.
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:38.260]   Okay, but you can just cleave the phosphate group.
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.060]   Right, right, exactly.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.980]   NR, they claim, this is not my claim,
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.380]   but they claim that NR is quote unquote,
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:48.140]   25% more effective than NMN
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.860]   in raising whole blood NAD levels.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:52.540]   But I'm guessing that's milligram for milligram, right.
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:54.860]   Okay, so then you just adjust the milligram dosage
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.140]   a little bit and so on.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:01.140]   What's entirely unclear is what raising blood NAD
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.260]   translates to in terms of getting more NAD into cells.
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:06.100]   I don't know that that's really--
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:09.260]   - Specifically cells like skeletal muscles, right?
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.740]   I think based on Josh Rabinowitz's work,
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.580]   I also had Josh Rabinowitz on the podcast
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.020]   to talk about this.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   And I trust Josh on this much more
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.820]   than I would trust any marketing material.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.300]   - Sure.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.900]   - Because he doesn't have a dog in this fight, right?
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:25.660]   He just does the work.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.500]   And what Josh's research showed,
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.820]   which is basically NAD flux research,
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:32.140]   has demonstrated that look,
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:36.660]   the liver is probably the place of greatest uptake
[01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:40.220]   in addition to blood, and that's about all we know.
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.020]   Like it's not clear how much of this
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.900]   is getting into other cells.
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:49.220]   So, I mean, the rest of it is just,
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.460]   I think rearranging deck chairs on a Titanic
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:55.140]   as far as like, how much does it really matter?
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:57.020]   And again, I don't even think it's worth arguing
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.740]   about whether NMN or NR is more bioavailable
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:02.140]   because to your point, you can sort of adjust the dose.
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:05.140]   And I trust that whatever you're taking NR or NMN,
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:07.620]   you are getting some NR into the cells
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.380]   and that's being converted to NAD.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.740]   But we still keep coming back to the jugular question,
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.100]   does that matter?
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:16.780]   Does increasing intracellular NAD matter
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.580]   when the system is so tightly regulated?
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.380]   So I think what you see is a lot of marketing material
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:24.620]   that tries to make the case that you can do it.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:26.660]   Great, I'll grant you that you can do it.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:28.380]   Does it matter?
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.500]   Does it matter in lifespan?
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.900]   The answer appears to be unambiguously no at this point.
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:34.220]   Does it matter in healthspan?
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.300]   I think that's what we're discussing.
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:41.020]   - There's something so sticky about the longevity field,
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.940]   just so sticky about this idea
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:45.100]   that one could take something and extend lifespan
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.820]   and people don't wanna be in the control group.
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:50.180]   So they're willing to invest significant amounts
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:51.260]   of money to do it.
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:53.580]   - Well, I mean, I think the bigger issue is like,
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:56.700]   you can't do the longevity experiment in humans.
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:58.620]   And I'm sure that these companies that sell this,
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.860]   and I honestly, I don't follow this space.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.940]   I don't know how many of these companies
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:02.780]   there are out there.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:07.340]   I can name two because five years ago,
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.940]   which was the last time I really dug into this,
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:12.300]   I knew who the two dominant players were.
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.060]   For all I know, there could be 20 companies today
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.500]   that are selling NR and NMN.
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.340]   I don't know anymore.
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:21.340]   - They're probably about 30 to 50 prior to this FDA ruling,
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:27.220]   which is kind of an interesting situation in its own right.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:31.340]   What happened there was the supplement NMN,
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:36.340]   suddenly the FDA decided that it should not be sold
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:39.060]   over the counter anymore,
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:43.540]   because there was a clinical trial initiated on NMN,
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:48.540]   which essentially makes NMN a drug for clinical testing
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:53.100]   and thereby can't be classified as a supplement any longer.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.740]   That was the rationale as I understood it.
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:58.380]   But as with things like N-acetylcysteine-
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.900]   - That was more of a lobbying effort though, I think.
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.700]   I don't think actually that was a scientific decision.
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.420]   I think that was more of a lobbying decision.
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:07.980]   - From a market protections,
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:09.700]   from an IP protection standpoint.
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:13.260]   - And this had happened prior for N-acetylcysteine, NAC,
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.340]   which some people take, it's a mucolytic,
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:17.140]   it's actually a great decongestant.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:20.780]   If you're congested and it increases glutathione,
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:22.060]   that's my understanding.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.660]   And I believe somebody checked me on this-
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:27.060]   - Does it decrease or increase glutathione?
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:29.380]   - Increases glutathione, is my understanding.
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:30.220]   If I have that wrong,
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.140]   someone will tell me quickly in the comments.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.740]   My understanding is that in Europe,
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:36.500]   NAC might even be available by prescription.
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.380]   In the US, you can still buy it over the counter.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:41.060]   But a few years back, the FDA said,
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:43.180]   "Nope, can't sell NAC any longer."
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:47.020]   And there was a pushback lobby to keep it on the market.
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:50.140]   And you can still buy it on Amazon.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.680]   The same thing has more or less happened with NMN.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:55.740]   And certainly with NR.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:57.620]   Although NR was never in question
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.900]   in terms of whether or not it should be sold
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:37:59.940]   as a supplement or not.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.780]   Because as far as I know,
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.680]   there's no clinical trial on NR, at least not currently.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.720]   So there's a clinical trial on NMN,
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.340]   which classifies it as an experimental drug.
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.920]   And therefore the FDA said,
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:12.660]   "Nope, you can't sell it as a supplement."
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:14.700]   A few companies, major companies,
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:17.180]   pulled NMN from the market in the US.
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:20.620]   Many smaller companies just kind of watched and waited
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.140]   and continued to sell it.
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.180]   And I checked prior to the beginning of this episode,
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:26.020]   and you can still buy it online.
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:28.020]   But of course, a lot of what we're saying today
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.260]   is kind of a, "Why would you?"
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.860]   We're not really coming up with strong arguments
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:36.800]   for taking NMN, at least not in today's discussion.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.640]   - Yeah, I mean, again,
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.600]   I think the strongest argument I could make
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.280]   based on the data would be potentially
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   on the basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma risk reduction,
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.120]   if indeed those results are reproducible.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.880]   That, again, that would be justification,
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.280]   again, for the right individual.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.800]   Wouldn't be a justification for me,
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.520]   might be a justification for somebody.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.360]   But really, the rest of it is,
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.760]   why do you need to do experiments on this
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.080]   if you're selling a supplement
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:10.020]   when you don't need to make claims to sell a supplement?
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:12.960]   Like, if it's a drug, you have to have an indication.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.200]   Can't sell a drug without rigorous trials
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.500]   that demonstrate both safety and efficacy.
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.220]   I do think it's pretty safe to say that,
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:24.460]   I do think NR and NMN are probably safe.
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:28.140]   There has been some voice around the idea
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.860]   that NR could increase the risk of cancer.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:32.620]   - Right, and the experts in this area,
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:35.220]   like Charles Brenner, have pushed back hard on that,
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:39.220]   arguing that the studies were not done well,
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:40.620]   is that, I recall?
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.100]   - I think that's probably fair.
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:43.640]   I don't think there's been a well-done study
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.420]   in this entire field, is part of the problem, right?
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:49.620]   So, and that's probably too harsh a statement.
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.120]   But this is not a field that's, like, you know,
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.660]   that's necessarily lending itself to the rigor
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:58.700]   that you would in pharmacotherapy.
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:00.260]   And I think there are probably, you know,
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.300]   you mentioned Charles Brenner.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:03.900]   Like, I think Charles does good work, right?
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.620]   - And he works on many things, not just this.
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:08.460]   - Yeah, and by the way, I don't think,
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.860]   I don't hear Charles out there saying
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:11.460]   that NR increases lifespan.
[01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:14.980]   - No, in fact, I don't wanna quote him at all,
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:19.980]   but I think he would argue that sirtuins, NR, NMN,
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:23.180]   should not logically or practically be linked
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:25.700]   to efforts to extend lifespan,
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:29.180]   but that there are some interesting positive effects
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:33.580]   of augmenting NR as a means to increase NAD
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:36.220]   for sake of anti-inflammation
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:39.060]   and some of these other effects that we've been discussing.
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.140]   - Yeah, that's my understanding of his position as well,
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:44.100]   is that I think he firmly agrees with what I laid down
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.340]   at the outset of this, which is,
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:51.260]   there is no meaningful, logical connection
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:54.780]   between the relationship of sirtuins,
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.580]   caloric restriction, and NR.
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:59.780]   That's just a, that's a shell game that is empty.
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:04.580]   And you're right, I mean, I think part of the reason
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:07.500]   why I think there's much better research going on
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:11.340]   with rapamycin is that there's really no commercial interest
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.620]   in rapamycin.
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.980]   Like, nobody's gonna make money selling rapamycin.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.260]   - Because it's so cheap?
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.700]   - Well, yeah, and it's actually not cheap,
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.140]   but it's a drug that is off patent, right?
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.460]   So this is a drug that was approved by the FDA 25 years ago.
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:25.860]   - So generic forms are inexpensive enough that no--
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.140]   - Believe it or not, they're not.
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.620]   This is the irony of it, is generic,
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:32.260]   so rapamune is the brand drug
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:37.700]   that was initially approved in 1999.
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:40.660]   And today, if you go and buy rapamycin,
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:42.180]   you're gonna not buy rapamune,
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:47.180]   you're gonna probably buy generic sirolimus or rapamycin.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:49.140]   And yet it's surprisingly quite expensive.
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:50.300]   Now, it's not enormously expensive
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:51.660]   'cause you're not taking much of it,
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:54.780]   but it's about five bucks a milligram.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:57.420]   That's pretty expensive.
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:59.020]   So if you're taking eight milligrams a week,
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.300]   that's 40 bucks a week is probably what I spend
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.220]   on rapamycin, that ain't cheap.
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.600]   - No. - Relative to, you know,
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.060]   and it's cheaper than some things I take,
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:07.380]   but it's not cheap.
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:10.540]   But the point is, like, nobody has a commercial interest
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:12.180]   in rapamycin, right?
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:13.820]   It's sort of an irrelevant drug.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:16.940]   It's, but the interest is scientific, right?
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:20.340]   And the commercial interest is in what we call rapalogs,
[01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:22.660]   which are analogs of rapamycin
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:26.020]   that are being investigated by a number of companies
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:28.180]   to look at new indications.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:30.720]   For example, immunity, immune function, right?
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.020]   So rapamycin historically is thought of
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.580]   as an immune suppressant,
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:37.300]   because that's the context in which it was approved
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:40.560]   for patients undergoing organ transplantation.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.660]   But, you know, I think Joan Manik and Lloyd Clickstein,
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:51.240]   when they published that paper in 2014, using Everolimus,
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.660]   where they took a group of 65 year olds
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.700]   and randomized them to either a placebo
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:01.020]   or different doses and dosing schedules of Everolimus,
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.860]   found an enhanced immunity
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:06.300]   in response to an influenza vaccine.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.500]   Which again was, for me, that was the turning point, right?
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.820]   That's when rapamycin went from
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:11.980]   something that was interesting,
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:14.900]   based on the first ITP in 2009,
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:18.500]   to maybe we should be taking this in 2014.
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.660]   So between 2009 and 2014,
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:24.140]   I was kind of looking at the curiosity of rapamycin
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:27.180]   and saying, well, cool that it worked in mice,
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:29.660]   I don't think humans should ever consider this,
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.020]   to that study, which was like, wait a minute,
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:33.460]   something's different.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:37.540]   If you take rapamycin, as a human at least, every day,
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.900]   it seems to suppress your immune system,
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:42.700]   but if you just pulse it once a week,
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:43.820]   as they did in that study,
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.020]   it seems to improve immune function.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:48.020]   Which again, means it's an immune modulator,
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.740]   it can go up or down in the immune system.
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.420]   That was really the hypothesis
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.860]   that emerged from that experiment.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:54.780]   And so now the question is,
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:59.060]   could you design drugs that are more specific
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:02.100]   to mTOR complex one, which rapamycin is not,
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:04.780]   but you can get around that by dosing it intermittently.
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:08.740]   And then of course, is it a drug that has efficacy
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:13.180]   in terms of other things that can be tested in humans
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.220]   that are not longevity?
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.260]   'Cause you can't test lifespan in humans, obviously.
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.820]   - Right, you're 50, right?
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:19.660]   50 years old? - 51.
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:23.260]   - 51, you seem to be vigorous.
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:25.580]   You take great care of yourself.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:27.660]   How much do you think taking rapamycin,
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:30.180]   for how many years have you been taking it?
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.300]   - Six.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:35.620]   - Has contributed to your current state or vigor?
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:36.460]   - Zero idea.
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:40.740]   - This is my opportunity to ask about your belief
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:44.660]   or lack of belief in biological aging tests.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.300]   Because if somebody is going to experiment
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:48.200]   with any or all of these things,
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.500]   they may want to evaluate
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:54.140]   whether or not their biological age is changing.
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:57.360]   And there are a number of these tests available.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.060]   And people love this stuff.
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.100]   - Love 'em. - They love 'em.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:02.720]   I mean, who wouldn't wanna see that they are 51 years old,
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.540]   but their biological age is 37?
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.940]   - I just did a movement test the other day.
[01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:10.300]   So it's a very fancy camera system
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:12.540]   where it's got a million cameras on you,
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:14.660]   and you go through this whole exercise.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.180]   How high can you jump?
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:17.500]   How far can you throw?
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:18.380]   Like, it was awesome.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:20.680]   And then it gives you a movement age.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:23.620]   Andrew, I was 22.
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:24.820]   - I believe it.
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.380]   - I mean, I should feel amazing.
[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:30.580]   Do you actually think I move like a 22-year-old?
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:32.740]   I mean, are you freaking kidding me?
[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:34.820]   I bet you if I went and did that again tomorrow,
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:37.740]   I'd come back at 31 or something.
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:41.900]   There is so much nonsense in this type of testing.
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:45.100]   It is just, you know, look,
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:47.900]   there's probably something to be said
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:52.040]   if I do that and I come out at 22 as I did versus 92.
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:52.880]   - Sure.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:57.160]   - I would grant you that if you took 150-year-olds
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.500]   and you put them through a movement test,
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.620]   the ones that really, really are struggling
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.580]   will come out older,
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.540]   and the ones that really, really are doing great
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:05.420]   are gonna come out younger.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.620]   So great, I guess it's nice.
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.500]   I guess I move reasonably well for a 51-year-old.
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:13.380]   But it's simply impossible to believe that I can do today
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.760]   what I could do when I was 22
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:16.620]   with respect to movement and strength and power,
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:18.060]   which is what that was assessing.
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:20.060]   You're doing a lot of jumping, single leg jump here,
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.380]   do all this kind of stuff.
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:23.220]   Balance testing, all sorts of things.
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.660]   And I guess I would say the gold standard
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.100]   for any of these biologic aging tests
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:30.500]   has to be the following.
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:37.500]   What is a better predictor of remaining years of life,
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:40.520]   chronologic age or biologic age?
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.100]   That's, to me, the most important standard.
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:45.500]   So how old are you chronologically?
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:48.580]   - I turned 49 in six weeks.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:49.780]   - Okay.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:53.220]   So I'm sure your listeners will not like to hear this
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.800]   because they would probably hope and believe
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.720]   that you are immortal, but--
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.300]   - Some might want to hear
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:00.860]   that I'm gonna be taken out soon.
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:02.340]   (laughing)
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:05.880]   - But let's just grant your mortality as a given.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:10.640]   Based just on your chronologic age,
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.940]   an actuary would come up with a pretty decent prediction
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:14.980]   of how long you're going to live.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:17.540]   Now, I would argue that that's a crude assumption
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:19.660]   because it doesn't take into account the fact
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:22.000]   that you're metabolically healthy,
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.740]   that you do all of the things that you do.
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:27.500]   But just based on the fact that you are a man
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:30.980]   who is 49 years old and who doesn't smoke,
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:35.980]   those three things would give me, if I were an actuary,
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:39.600]   a very good prediction of your life expectancy.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.900]   And because I'm not an actuary,
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:42.180]   I don't know the exact number,
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:46.420]   but my guess is it would be predicted at this point
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:49.040]   at another 37 years.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:49.880]   - Okay.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.580]   Well, I bought that chart, my life in weeks.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.420]   - Yes.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:54.780]   - In fact, I bought two of them
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:57.260]   for reasons that are uninteresting.
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:01.000]   But I've watched that chart, Phil.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.420]   Not quite what you predicted,
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:09.820]   but I put my estimated lifespan to be 95.
[01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:10.660]   - Great, that's fine.
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.260]   - And then I have little lines on the side
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:16.740]   of how much vigor I felt from,
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.380]   and just overall wellness, completely subjective,
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:23.660]   of zero being like completely cratered near death
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:25.540]   to 10, like it's best I've ever felt.
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:28.100]   - But you make that note every how often?
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:32.660]   - Okay, so what I did is from 10 to 15, I felt blank.
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:36.180]   And then in my 20s, I actually didn't feel so great
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:40.340]   because I was working 80 hour weeks, commonly.
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:42.420]   You can ask my former lab technicians.
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.060]   I was just talking to Feng Wen recently.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.820]   And I mean, I used to work to collapse, not healthy.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.380]   You know, 80 hour a week, maybe 100 hours occasionally,
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:52.300]   maybe 70, maybe back to 40, but just too much work,
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:54.420]   not enough sleep, nutrition, not great,
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.620]   just not doing the right things,
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:49:00.620]   but just gave my 20s to being in lab, basically,
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.500]   and a lot of my 30s as well.
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:08.100]   So I would say from 40 to 45,
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:12.140]   my vigor was higher than in my 30s.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:17.140]   And then now I track, I would say about every two months,
[01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:18.500]   I'll start filling in that line.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.340]   And it's adjusted for by stressors
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.340]   and adjusted for by positive things in life.
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:25.500]   And the goal for me is to figure out
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.140]   what are the behavioral tools
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:29.140]   and other things I can do or take
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:32.220]   that are going to keep the vigor as high as possible,
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:35.380]   vigor, wellbeing, internal peace, et cetera,
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:36.220]   all of that combined,
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:37.260]   kind of what I'm calling wellness
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:40.180]   in this very subjective measure,
[01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:43.980]   as high as possible as I transition to my 50s,
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:45.980]   my 60s, 70s, and 80s.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:47.780]   And I'm guessing that I'm going to have to do
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:50.020]   many more things in my 80s and 90s
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:53.300]   in order to maintain a similar,
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:57.660]   hopefully, level of vigor and wellbeing than I do now.
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:49:59.740]   And the question is, will I be able to?
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:00.660]   - Yeah, maybe, maybe.
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:05.660]   I might take a slightly different angle on that,
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:08.060]   but let me go back and make one point,
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.500]   and then we'll come back to this point,
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.620]   which is actually really interesting.
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:12.300]   - Yeah, 'cause I think the chart is great.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:17.300]   I think the chart, more than any supplement for longevity,
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.560]   gives you a, or gives one a visual perspective
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.840]   of where they sit in this long arc.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.880]   And I don't think the brain is very good
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.400]   at anchoring us to the notion that we are mortal,
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.240]   because if we think about that
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.400]   for even a few moments too long, it makes us anxious.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:40.280]   And I think we are very good at avoiding that reality.
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:42.680]   - Yeah, well, it's, as you said,
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.260]   it's very difficult to contemplate finitude.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.480]   So I actually wanna talk about that,
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.520]   'cause I think it's so interesting,
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:50.600]   but I just wanna make this point
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.960]   about the actuarial point, right?
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:54.600]   So let's just say, actuarially,
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:57.600]   your expectation is 40 years more at this point,
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:00.760]   because you're 49, you're a male, and you don't smoke.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:03.400]   So we believe you have somewhere between 35
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.000]   and 40 more years of life predicted
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.440]   on the basis of your biologic age.
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:09.620]   - That's it?
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:10.460]   That's all I got?
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:12.860]   - You're gonna live to whatever, 88 to 91 or something.
[01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:14.480]   I'm making that up, but that's like, okay.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.800]   - I better get cracking on some stuff.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.600]   - So now, let's pretend you went
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.240]   and did a biologic age test.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:24.320]   Okay, so let's say you did that.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:27.340]   And let's say it came back and said you're 25.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:34.960]   So if I had a 25-year-old male, non-smoker in front of me,
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.740]   what's his life expectancy?
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:42.380]   Well, it's about 60 to 65 years.
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:45.840]   Does that mean that you, Andrew,
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.160]   have 60 to 65 more years of life
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:52.640]   based on a fact that your biologic clock says you're 25?
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.560]   Do you believe that?
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:54.740]   - No, no way.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:56.480]   - No, of course not.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:59.800]   Now, this would be an easy thing to test, not in humans,
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:02.760]   but you could do it in mice, right?
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:03.880]   Interesting that, to my knowledge,
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:05.840]   that experiment hasn't been done.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:10.560]   So right out of the gate, when I look at people
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:14.000]   talking about their biologic age,
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.960]   well, I'm actually 60 years old, chronologically,
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.960]   but my biologic age is 35.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:23.920]   My response is, who cares, truthfully?
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.840]   Is that a good thing?
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:26.160]   Yes, probably.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:31.160]   But is it tangibly, measurably meaningful
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:37.400]   to have a biologic age of 35 versus 40 versus 30
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:38.240]   if you're 60?
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:43.280]   I think we're applying a very false level of precision
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:46.680]   to something that might only need to be directionally true.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.720]   Secondly, we don't really yet understand
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:52.520]   the biologic noise in that measurement, right?
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.320]   So there are lots of things that we measure
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.520]   that are really noisy.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:53:01.520]   So if I measured your, I don't know,
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:06.400]   let's think of something that's very biologically noisy,
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.920]   your triglyceride level.
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:11.320]   Like, your triglycerides are pretty noisy
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:13.680]   unless I do something very important,
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:15.520]   which is standardize it by how long
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.560]   it's been since your last meal.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:20.360]   Like, if you ask me right now what my trigs are,
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.560]   I have no earthly idea because I probably ate
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:27.440]   three hours ago, and I don't even remember what I ate,
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.360]   how much fat was in it, how much carbohydrate was in it,
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.480]   I have no idea.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:32.000]   So the only way you could really get
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.080]   a triglyceride measurement and put any weight to it
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:38.440]   is if you've been fasting for eight to 12 hours.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.720]   Then we can at least say, hey, a triglyceride level
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:44.280]   of 50 milligrams per deciliter is excellent,
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.400]   whereas a triglyceride level of 120 milligrams
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.440]   per deciliter is lousy.
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.480]   But if you measured my trigs today,
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.240]   meaning at this moment, and they were 150,
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:54.040]   that could be totally reasonable,
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.120]   even though at fasting levels, I'm at 50.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:00.040]   So we know that because we know exactly
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.360]   what goes into the triglyceride measurement.
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.440]   But when you look at a biologic clock
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.400]   that takes into account your glucose level,
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.360]   your vitamin D level, your epigenetic marker here or there,
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.400]   those are very noisy things.
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:15.000]   So how do I know when I measure it in you now
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.720]   versus when I measure it in you a year from now,
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.600]   I captured you in the exact same space?
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:21.960]   I mean, I don't.
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:25.360]   So it's for that reason that I just have a very hard time
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.760]   putting any stock in this.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.180]   Now, does that mean that in the future,
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:31.680]   we won't find some benefit in this?
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.320]   I think we probably will.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:36.760]   I do think of all the things that go into it,
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.040]   probably the epigenetic part of it
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.960]   would be the most interesting.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:43.560]   But again, what most people don't understand
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:44.880]   is sort of a dirty little secret
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.720]   is how difficult it is to measure the,
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.660]   and to sequence the epigenome, right?
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:54.000]   So to my knowledge, none of the companies
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.120]   that are doing this, I may be incorrect on this, by the way,
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.680]   but the last time I looked, which was about a year ago,
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:01.740]   not a single company was correctly sequencing
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:03.380]   the epigenome on these things.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:06.400]   So they were not able to accurately say what,
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.000]   they were giving you an average representation
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000]   of your methylation,
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.280]   but they weren't going base pair by base pair
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.080]   and actually sequencing this
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.000]   the way we would sequence the genome.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.600]   So again, you just, it's so much noise in this system.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:23.320]   And I just think it creates a little bit of a distraction
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.680]   for people, truthfully.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.040]   - Do you avoid going through the non,
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:33.040]   let's just say the non-traditional scanner at the airport,
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.340]   the one that might use higher levels of radiation?
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.180]   - No, no.
[01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:37.340]   - Do you think about how many flights you take
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:38.720]   as a source of radiation?
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:40.700]   - No, let's just keep this all in context.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:44.980]   So the NRC recommends that a human being,
[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:47.540]   or at least an American, should expose themselves
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:52.540]   to less than 50 millisieverts of radiation a year.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:54.920]   Okay, so that number doesn't mean anything to somebody.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:56.820]   So let me give people a sense of what that means.
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:00.780]   So how many millisieverts of radiation do you and I receive?
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:02.500]   'Cause we both live at sea level.
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:06.020]   So just ambient radiation, living at sea level,
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:08.700]   is one millisievert a year.
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:12.680]   Okay, so we just chewed up 2% of our annual allocation.
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:14.980]   What if you moved to Colorado?
[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:17.380]   Now you're a mile up.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:21.340]   That increases you from one to two millisieverts a year.
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:26.340]   Okay, what if you had a CT scan of your chest,
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:28.800]   a CT angiogram?
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.100]   Well, it depends on where you got it done.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:31.640]   If you got it done at a really good place
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.620]   with a fast scanner and great software,
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.620]   probably three millisieverts a year.
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:38.300]   If you got it done at a place that's sort of average,
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:41.340]   might be 10 to 15 millisieverts, pardon me, per scan.
[01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:44.500]   Now here's what's really interesting.
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.860]   By the way, I'm totally fascinated by this question,
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:49.740]   which is how much radiation is too much.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:52.320]   A DEXA scan, by the way, you can't even measure
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.700]   how many millisieverts you're getting.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:56.480]   So a DEXA scan is like less radiation
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.060]   than a cross-country flight.
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:56:59.660]   So it's super, super, super low,
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.760]   less than an X-ray or anything like that.
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:09.080]   People who work in nuclear plants, I'm told,
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:10.600]   I haven't looked at the primary data on this,
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:13.080]   but I've talked to people who incessantly do this.
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:15.040]   So it's possible I'm a little bit off on this,
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:20.040]   but I'm told that these people are at 10 times
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.640]   that level of radiation exposure and sometimes higher.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.800]   So they're not getting 50.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:28.480]   They might be getting like 500 millisieverts a year.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.720]   And yet, interestingly, they're not
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:31.740]   at an increased risk for cancer.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.440]   I'm not sure what to make of that.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:38.720]   But it suggests to me that we probably don't need to worry
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:43.200]   about things like airport scanners and flights.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:45.040]   In fact, even if you look at pilots
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:48.000]   who do constant flights across the poles,
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.480]   'cause you're gonna get the most radiation
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:51.580]   going over the pole, to my knowledge,
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:53.320]   there's no convincing data that suggests
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:55.520]   those people are at an increased risk of cancer either.
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.040]   And they're obviously at the upper end
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:01.120]   of what a civilian would experience in terms of radiation.
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:05.840]   So I'm not convinced that that's something
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.180]   we should be stressed about.
[01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:09.600]   - I think you just relieved a lot of people
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.680]   of some unnecessary concern.
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:12.880]   - I wanna go back to what you were saying earlier
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.340]   about what you need to do in your 90s
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.240]   versus what you're doing now.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.720]   So you said you think that in your 80s and 90s,
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:20.660]   you're gonna have to work harder
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:23.280]   to preserve the vitality that you have now.
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:27.360]   - Yeah, grip strength, jumping, cognitive function.
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.960]   I mean, I've got very good genes in terms of longevity
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:32.560]   on one side of my family, pretty good on the other,
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.220]   although not as robust.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:36.280]   I mean, if I just look historically.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:39.680]   Yeah, who knows, right?
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:44.160]   I mean, but my sense is that I'll live to be 95
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:47.900]   if, you know, barring, you know, bullet buster cancer.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:51.640]   - So I would say that, yes, you're gonna have to work hard
[01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:53.880]   in that last decade of life to preserve those things,
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:57.060]   but I think it's the work we do now
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:58.480]   that sets the stage for that.
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.200]   It's the foundational work that we do
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:01.480]   in this period of our lives.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.620]   You know, you and I are only a couple of years apart,
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:06.560]   but I think this is the critical decade.
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:10.040]   It's in your 50s to your 60s and in your 60s to your 70s
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:12.720]   that I think is the deciding time.
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:14.680]   - 50s to 70s. - 50s to 60s.
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.680]   Yeah, 50s to 70s.
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:18.520]   So what is it about this window
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.680]   that you and I are just entering now?
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:23.100]   And why is it so important?
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:27.360]   I think it's important because we're getting to that point
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:30.360]   where aging does start to show up.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:32.920]   Like, I think if you and I are being brutally honest,
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.320]   like we're kind of half the men we used to be.
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:39.440]   And again, that just means like, look,
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:43.080]   like a night of poor sleep shows up more, right?
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.360]   When you were working in the lab
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.240]   as hard as you were describing it,
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.520]   you could probably walk through walls
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:48.560]   when you were exhausted.
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:51.520]   - Yeah, a short nap would reset me near completely.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.360]   - Yeah.
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.400]   - I got more colds and flus in that time
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:55.720]   because I wasn't taking such good care.
[01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:56.960]   But then again, I was indoors more.
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:59.320]   So it's an imperfect experiment, but you're right.
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:04.320]   I think that as I've approached 50, I need to do more.
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:06.960]   - You need to do more self-care.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.960]   You need to be more mindful of what you're eating,
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:10.840]   how you're sleeping, how you're recovering
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:13.440]   from those workouts 'cause we still do hard workouts,
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:14.920]   but recovery plays a greater role.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:16.880]   In other words, we're just not quite as resilient
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.160]   as we used to be.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:19.360]   You know, I was telling somebody the other day,
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:21.520]   they asked me about my residency.
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:23.760]   I don't think I'm being hyperbolic when I say this.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.960]   I couldn't do one month of what I did for five years.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.120]   I really couldn't do it.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:30.640]   I don't think there's any,
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.200]   there's no way I could go back to that level
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.440]   of sleep deprivation for a month, let alone five years.
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:41.440]   So, you know, that's just a fact of aging, I think.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:45.360]   So, but what we have to do during this period of time
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:49.640]   is build up as much physiologic reserve as possible.
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.280]   And so the important thing is, you know,
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:53.680]   we have to stay in the game
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:57.640]   because compounding makes such a difference, right?
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:00.480]   So, you know, we're still young enough
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:03.120]   that we can actually put on muscle mass.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.080]   Now, that's not always gonna be the case.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.600]   It's gonna be very difficult to add muscle mass
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:10.240]   when you're in your mid to late 70s.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:14.280]   It's doable, but it's very, very difficult.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.680]   So instead, we wanna be putting on
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:18.520]   as much muscle mass as we can
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:21.360]   and increasing or at least maintaining strength
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.000]   as much as we can.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.100]   Again, probably increasing it is unlikely.
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:28.120]   Clearly we're not increasing power as we age, right?
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:30.120]   Andy Galpin has talked a lot about this.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:32.600]   The atrophy of the type two muscle fibers,
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.960]   the two way muscle fibers,
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.840]   really start to atrophy in your 20s and 30s.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:39.240]   So I know I don't have a fraction of the power
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:40.060]   that I used to have.
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:42.020]   And I know that because my vertical jump
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:45.120]   is literally half what it was when I was a teenager.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:48.040]   - Mine was never very good, so I--
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.320]   - It doesn't matter how good it was.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.160]   My point is like,
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:53.000]   if you know what your vertical jump was at 18, 19, 20,
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.560]   and then you do it today, I mean, it's literally 50%.
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:58.520]   And that's one of the purest tests of power.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:00.960]   So power's going down, strength is going down,
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:01.800]   but not as much.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.280]   Muscle mass is actually not,
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:04.700]   'cause remember, that's the order
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:05.800]   in which you lose things, right?
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.000]   You're gonna lose power, strength, and size of muscle.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.480]   But again, size still matters.
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.600]   It's still a glucose sink, all these other things.
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:17.120]   But what we don't wanna do is, you know,
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:18.260]   be out of the game, right?
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:21.820]   What we don't wanna do is injure ourselves
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:24.140]   and get a setback that becomes very difficult
[02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:25.400]   to recover from.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:28.180]   Because, you know, when you're our age,
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:32.300]   if you're inactive for months at a time,
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:35.300]   it's gonna be two to one or three to one ratio
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:37.400]   of inactivity to activity to get it back.
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.480]   - What about energy, sorry to interrupt,
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:43.120]   but since we've been talking about molecules
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.040]   and energetic pathways, what about energy?
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.600]   Just that get up and go.
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.440]   Let's just say after a decent night's sleep,
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:56.000]   seven and a half hours, waking up same time, more or less,
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.200]   you know, 6.30, 7 a.m. probably for you or me.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:03.580]   And why is it that as we get older, we have less energy?
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:05.920]   Our mutual good friend, the late Ben Barris,
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:06.980]   used to ask about this.
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:08.520]   He used to say, he called me Andy.
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.920]   He was like, "Andy, why do I have so much less energy?"
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:11.760]   I was like, "I don't know, I don't know."
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:13.120]   It's a great question.
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.880]   Now, unfortunately, he died of pancreatic cancer,
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.380]   so there may have been other things going on,
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:19.160]   but that was prior to the cancer,
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:20.960]   at least as far as I know.
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:22.520]   You know, it's a very interesting question.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:24.980]   Why do we have less energy?
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.800]   And I don't think anyone's ever been able
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:28.340]   to answer that question.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.880]   - No, and when you have kids,
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.240]   you're gonna be even more starkly confronted with that.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:38.740]   'Cause actually, it's one of the things I am most amazed by
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:41.940]   when I look at my kids, especially the youngest ones,
[02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:44.820]   the boys who are seven and 10,
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:48.240]   is what I just described as spontaneous outbursts of energy.
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:52.480]   Like their inability to sit still,
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.140]   their kinetic desire to just, like they will,
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:00.500]   like I remember once we were kind of walking through a mall
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.540]   and we're walking through the mall,
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:05.420]   they are sprinting ahead of us, sprinting back,
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:06.940]   sprinting ahead of us, sprinting back.
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:10.500]   Like imagine if you and I were walking through the mall
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:13.340]   and I just started running ahead and running back.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.220]   - You'd be so sore the next day.
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:17.260]   - Yeah, but it's like, it just wouldn't occur to me
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:19.940]   to ever run unless being chased, right?
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:23.380]   Like it's just, I mean, like we now live a life
[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:26.580]   like I think our ancestors did, which was, you know,
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:30.060]   if we're not deliberately in the business of moving
[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:32.280]   for a reason, like you're exercising,
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.740]   you're going for a walk for the sake of going for a walk,
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:36.860]   like you just wouldn't, it wouldn't occur to you
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:39.700]   go and expend energy for no reason.
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:42.040]   And yet kids do this, it's amazing.
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:45.320]   And look, it's gonna go down by the time you're a teenager,
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:49.700]   like just going from being, you know, sort of 10 to 18,
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:51.620]   there's probably a significant reduction
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:53.780]   in spontaneous outbursts of energy,
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.640]   let alone where we are now.
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:58.340]   And it's a great question.
[02:04:58.340 --> 02:04:59.340]   Maybe it's NAD.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:02.020]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:05.060]   - Maybe, although up until now,
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:06.420]   we've been talking about all these ways
[02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:08.420]   to try and increase NAD in the bloodstream
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:09.420]   and hopefully in cells.
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.500]   And I don't know, I take my NMN and my NR
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:14.500]   and I feel a little bit of a boost in energy,
[02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:16.780]   but I can't say that it's so significant
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:20.300]   that I feel like I can sprint back and forth
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:21.660]   just spontaneously.
[02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:24.100]   - Again, it's just so hard for me to imagine
[02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:28.220]   that any supplement or any drug, including rapamycin,
[02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:30.820]   which I think is the most promising
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:33.040]   geroprotective drug we have,
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:37.940]   I just can't imagine that those things even compare
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:42.780]   to what good sleep, good exercise and good nutrition do
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:45.500]   for your energy levels and vitality.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:48.860]   And the reality of it is all three of those things
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:52.180]   are hard to do, you know?
[02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:53.020]   - Yeah, they do.
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:53.840]   - Especially if you're an adult,
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:55.660]   like especially if you have a real life,
[02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.220]   you know, you got kids, you got a job,
[02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:01.020]   which is presumably many people listening to us right now.
[02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:03.460]   Like there's very few people listening to us right now
[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:06.320]   whose only purpose in life is to take care of their health.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:08.320]   Everybody's got something else they have to do,
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:10.660]   which means you have competing interests
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:13.100]   for how do you take care of yourself.
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.980]   So to sleep is not easy, right?
[02:06:15.980 --> 02:06:17.640]   Like we all are busy as hell.
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:20.220]   We don't want to have to stop what we're doing
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:22.740]   to undergo a nighttime routine,
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:24.620]   to put ourselves in the right head space,
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:27.060]   to be able to sleep, do all the things necessary,
[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:29.020]   give ourselves that eight hours in bed
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:32.300]   to hopefully get seven, seven and a half hours of sleep.
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:34.420]   Even people like me who like exercise,
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:36.340]   I know you like exercise,
[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:38.620]   it still is a sacrifice in terms of time.
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:42.820]   And for many people, certainly for me,
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:44.420]   food is the hardest of these all, right?
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:46.260]   If left to my own devices,
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:47.700]   I'd eat fricking Froot Loops all day.
[02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.140]   Like I love Froot Loops, right?
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.960]   - Interesting, by way of contrast,
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.260]   the food part is easy for me.
[02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:53.900]   I like healthy food and--
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:54.740]   - Oh, I like healthy food.
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:55.580]   I just like all food.
[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:57.740]   - Okay, yeah, I don't like unhealthy food.
[02:06:57.740 --> 02:06:59.300]   I've weaned myself off.
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:00.620]   I never really liked it that much.
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:02.420]   I mean, I like a great tasting slice of pizza
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:03.460]   or ice cream every once in a while,
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:06.980]   but I much prefer meat, fish, chicken, eggs,
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:08.740]   fruits, vegetables, rice, oatmeal.
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:10.380]   I just like that stuff.
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:12.060]   I'm a weirdo that way, I suppose.
[02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:14.060]   But on the topic of exercise,
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:16.580]   as it relates to vigor and longevity,
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:20.860]   I'm intrigued by how some forms of exercise
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:25.020]   give us more energy, especially the same day,
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:26.700]   and how some forms of exercise
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:30.060]   or even timing of exercise tends to deplete us.
[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:32.900]   Because I think one of your major sort of calls
[02:07:32.900 --> 02:07:35.740]   to the public has been to move more
[02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:39.240]   for sake of their healthspan and lifespan.
[02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:41.140]   But because of the time investment that it takes
[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:44.460]   to work out in a gym or to go for a run or a rock,
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:48.180]   I think some people think, well, that's a lot of time,
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:49.740]   but if it gives you more energy
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:52.220]   and more focus to do other things, well, then it's great.
[02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:53.760]   So it's not just about living longer,
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:55.180]   it's about being able to do more.
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:58.060]   And I've noticed, I don't have any science to back this up,
[02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:00.780]   but I'd love someone to run a test on this,
[02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:04.020]   that if I complete my workout before 9 a.m.,
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:06.620]   even if I have to start it while I'm a little bit fatigued,
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:09.100]   I have more energy all day long.
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:11.340]   But that if I initiate that workout,
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.960]   say mid to late morning,
[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:15.860]   I'm pretty tired in the afternoon.
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.060]   It's like I give everything I have to that workout.
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:20.700]   And so it becomes a little bit defeating
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:22.180]   since I'm not a professional athlete
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.700]   or even an amateur athlete.
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:25.900]   I'm working out for healthspan, lifespan,
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:30.340]   but I wanna do exercise that gives me more life
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:31.920]   during my waking hours.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:33.540]   I think somebody should study this.
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:35.900]   And I'm convinced that it has something to do
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:37.740]   with the change in body temperature
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:39.020]   that occurs across the day
[02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:40.660]   and the additional change in body temperature
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:43.180]   that occurs as a consequence of exercise.
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:44.260]   That's my hypothesis.
[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:46.460]   - Do you notice a seasonal change in that?
[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:48.100]   Do you experience it more or less
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:49.260]   in one season or the other?
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:51.700]   - I haven't thought about it that much, but not so much.
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:52.540]   Not so much.
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:56.060]   And I wonder whether folks like our friend Jocko Willink
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:58.340]   are able to do so much.
[02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.480]   He has so much vigor, that guy,
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:03.780]   in part because he basically exercises
[02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:06.580]   just after the lowest temperature phase
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:07.880]   of the circadian rhythm.
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:09.380]   And he uses exercise, presumably,
[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:11.020]   to drive himself out of that
[02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:13.060]   and get that temperature increase
[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:14.980]   that's the consequence of waking.
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:16.700]   But in his case, he's waking up so early.
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:19.160]   4.30 is when he starts those workouts.
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:21.200]   So it's something for people to play with.
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.980]   It's something that I don't think gets discussed enough,
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:25.820]   which is, yes, you should exercise,
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:28.620]   do resistance training, do cardiovascular training,
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:30.760]   but play with the timing of those
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:33.760]   and see how at a given intensity,
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:36.960]   it impacts your energy levels for the remainder of the day.
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:39.220]   I think it's an important metric that,
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:42.620]   again, I just don't see a lot of attention to.
[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:44.560]   Because I think if people could experience
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.700]   the increase in energy
[02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:48.460]   that is the consequence of working out
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:49.980]   at the right intensity in the right way
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:52.220]   at the right times for them,
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:53.860]   they'd be much more apt to do it.
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:55.300]   It wouldn't feel like this,
[02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.340]   like spending money on something
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:09:58.580]   that sure will make you live longer,
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:10:00.940]   but then you're depleted and you can't do cognitive work.
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:03.340]   There's something pretty impressive about the fact that,
[02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:06.820]   as far as I know, the last three,
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:08.460]   let's just call them, I don't want to call anyone out,
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:11.740]   specifically major pillars of the high-level administration
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:12.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine,
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:16.280]   to my knowledge, were all 5 a.m. runners.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:18.600]   There's something about early morning exercise.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:19.720]   And my good friend, Eddie Chang,
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:21.560]   who's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.000]   he's been on this podcast,
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.760]   known him since we were seven years old.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.440]   He's an early morning exerciser,
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.880]   and then he's got tons of energy all day.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:32.040]   - What about the reverse causality there?
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.400]   Do you think it's possible that they have a whole,
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:36.800]   they have a system of high energy
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:38.540]   that makes Jocko who he is,
[02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:41.000]   or makes these people who they are?
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.500]   And as a result of that,
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:44.740]   they're able to work out five o'clock in the morning.
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:45.620]   - Yeah, I don't doubt it.
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:47.980]   I just have noticed that in the few times in my life
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:50.980]   where I've kicked my own butt to get out
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:53.260]   and start working out really early,
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:54.740]   I have more energy all day long.
[02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:56.400]   Sometimes I still require a brief nap,
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:58.440]   but it's a pretty striking effect
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:01.700]   as compared to the 10 a.m. workout effect.
[02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:03.620]   So I've started setting a standard
[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:06.900]   of trying to get my workout done before 9 a.m.
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:08.500]   So anyway, it's something for people to play with,
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:13.500]   because the more energy to live in your waking hours,
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:15.100]   perhaps not longer,
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:18.340]   but certainly have more energy in terms of output,
[02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:22.460]   I think is a significant and undervalued parameter.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:26.340]   So let's quickly return to supplements.
[02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:29.700]   We, I think, are converging on an answer
[02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:35.920]   about NR, NMN, and NAD, which is you don't take them.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:36.840]   - Correct.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:41.840]   - I take NR and NMN with not a lot of religious adherence,
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:43.700]   I should say.
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:45.860]   If I ran out, I might not buy it for a while.
[02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:48.060]   And the only observed effect for me
[02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:49.620]   is this accelerated hair growth,
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:51.020]   which is a pain in the butt, frankly,
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:52.940]   'cause it just means I have to get my hair cut more often.
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:54.420]   I'm not trying to grow my hair faster.
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:58.540]   But okay, what are some other supplements,
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:02.220]   if any, that you take that are peripheral to this pathway
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:04.180]   or separate from this pathway?
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:06.880]   Rapamycin is a prescription drug only, right?
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:10.160]   So are there any over-the-counter things that you take
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:13.200]   that you would place into the lifespan category?
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.800]   Maybe they touch into healthspan as well.
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:17.040]   I'm happy to list off what I do,
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:21.440]   but what are your, let's just say top five, at least.
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.100]   - Well, I don't take that many,
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:27.440]   so a top five would be a pretty exhaustive list.
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.760]   I think the other supplements that I take,
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:31.720]   I do take EPA and DHA.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:33.920]   - In the form of liquid or capsule fish oil?
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:37.620]   - Capsules, not because I have an affection
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:38.740]   for capsule over liquid.
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:40.460]   It's just gonna increase my compliance.
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:42.100]   If I take, I've done both,
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:44.180]   and I noticed when I was taking liquid,
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.540]   'cause you're storing it in the fridge,
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:47.500]   it's just one more step removed,
[02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:49.100]   and I was just less likely to remember
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:50.600]   to take it twice a day.
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:57.220]   I take theracumin,
[02:12:57.220 --> 02:13:03.200]   and there's some reasonable evidence in MCI patients
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:06.520]   that theracumin improves cognitive function,
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:11.460]   so I think there's a relatively low downside
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:14.420]   to the hypothesis that theracumin
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:17.780]   may preserve cognitive function.
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:20.820]   Again, I wouldn't put that in the category
[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:22.300]   of beat the table for it.
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:25.400]   I think it's just reasonable evidence.
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:31.080]   I take, I do take vitamin D because interestingly,
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:34.320]   despite the fact that I'm outside every day,
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:36.320]   without supplemental vitamin D,
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:38.420]   my levels are surprisingly low.
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:39.540]   - How much do you take?
[02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:41.080]   - I take 5,000 IU,
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:47.220]   and that takes me from kind of a level of 30-ish
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:49.040]   to a level of 50-ish,
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:52.220]   and there's a lot of debate
[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:54.040]   about how high vitamin D levels should be.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.360]   That's a whole separate podcast.
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.900]   We could waste time on that in 10 years, yeah.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.160]   My appetite to talk about that one.
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:04.000]   Let me think, what else do I take?
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.620]   'Cause I sure, oh, I do take methylfolate and methyl B12,
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:11.560]   and again, the rationale there is
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:16.840]   I do think there's some evidence
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:19.520]   that elevated levels of homocysteine
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:23.040]   are bad in and of themselves,
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:24.800]   so there's no denying the fact
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:26.440]   that elevated levels of homocysteine
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.120]   are associated with bad things.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:30.320]   That's unambiguously clear,
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.900]   meaning there's an association
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:33.960]   between badness and homocysteine.
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:36.860]   What's not clear is, is it causal?
[02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:40.360]   Now, there's definitely one mechanism you can point to,
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:42.800]   although, again, mechanisms are what they are.
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:45.660]   We just spent how many hours talking about mechanisms
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:48.400]   that theoretically make sense that never pan out,
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.400]   but mechanistically, homocysteine will inhibit the clearance
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:56.360]   of something called symmetric
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:58.120]   and asymmetric dimethyl arginine.
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.760]   Have you heard of these things, SDMA and ADMA?
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:05.760]   So, ADMA and SDMA regulate nitric oxide synthase,
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.080]   and homocysteine impairs their clearance,
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:13.640]   and therefore, when you have high levels of homocysteine,
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.940]   it results ultimately in impaired nitric oxide synthase,
[02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:20.320]   and therefore, lower nitric oxide.
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:23.740]   So, this has been proposed as at least one mechanism
[02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:26.460]   by which homocysteine might negatively impact
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.660]   vascular disease.
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:31.320]   So, and we also know, by the way,
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:35.080]   that ADMA and SDMA are cleared by the kidneys,
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.140]   and therefore, this is also proposed
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.620]   as one of the mechanisms by which impaired kidney function
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:44.500]   impacts vascular health, 'cause that's a known, right?
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.180]   If your kidneys don't work well,
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:48.340]   your risk of heart disease goes way up.
[02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:50.100]   So, this is now proposed as a link
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:52.460]   between what we observe with homocysteine
[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:54.220]   and impaired renal function.
[02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:59.020]   So, we know that if you take methylfolate
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:02.980]   and methyl B12, you're gonna lower homocysteine.
[02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:04.520]   That's abundantly clear.
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:09.300]   So, the thinking is that that might actually lower ADMA,
[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:11.480]   SDMA, and raise nitric oxide synthase.
[02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:13.940]   Again, relatively low cost,
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:17.700]   low risk thing to take at modest doses.
[02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:18.980]   I also, there's probably some evidence
[02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:22.220]   that over-supplementing vitamin B is problematic,
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.860]   especially B6.
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:25.380]   So, I don't-- - Because of peripheral
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:27.020]   nerve damage. - Exactly.
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:28.540]   So, I don't supplement B6.
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:32.560]   I'm just taking a bit of folate and methyl B12.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:33.900]   Let me think, what else do I take?
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:35.860]   'Cause I do take a couple other things.
[02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:40.420]   Oh, I take magnesium L3 and eight
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:42.200]   and ashwagandha for sleep.
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:48.980]   I take SlowMag, which is just a magnesium chloride
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:51.580]   slow-releasing version of magnesium,
[02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:55.540]   and I take methyl, pardon me, I take magnesium oxide.
[02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.020]   So, I take magnesium in three forms.
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:16:58.980]   So, I'm long magnesium.
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:02.560]   - You're carpet bombing. - Yeah, I'm big on magnesium.
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:05.580]   Great for bowel function, great for, I mean,
[02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:07.900]   I don't know the last time I had a cramp in my life.
[02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:09.980]   It's been years since I've had a cramp,
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:12.700]   despite exercising in a really hot place
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:14.380]   like Austin, Texas, where I'm sweating
[02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:15.740]   like there was no tomorrow.
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:18.780]   Whether you call it a supplement or not,
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:23.780]   I take electrolytes, I take Element,
[02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:27.940]   which I should disclose I'm an investor in that company.
[02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:29.620]   So, I drink an Element a day.
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.740]   I take creatine monohydrate, five grams a day.
[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:34.060]   I take AG most mornings.
[02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:37.300]   Oh, and I take Pendulum, the probiotic.
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:38.300]   - Got it. - Yep.
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:40.280]   As far as I know, there's no other probiotic
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.780]   that has any meaningful effect on the body
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:44.220]   outside of Pendulum, right?
[02:17:44.220 --> 02:17:46.980]   Pendulum's the, 'cause if you buy the argument
[02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:49.020]   that a probiotic for your gut
[02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:51.180]   needs to have anaerobic bacteria in it,
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:53.860]   there's no value in giving you aerobic bacteria.
[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:55.220]   So, you have to have something anaerobic.
[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:57.920]   So, Akkermansia, which works through
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:02.260]   the GLP-1 butyrate pathway, is anaerobic,
[02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:04.060]   and Pendulum's the only company that can make it.
[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:05.820]   I have no affiliation with this company.
[02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:07.760]   I think you should have the CEO,
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:09.900]   Colleen Cutcliffe, on your show.
[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:12.880]   She's an actual scientist, and she's fantastic,
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:16.140]   and it's a really interesting story
[02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:18.540]   how they kind of developed this and how difficult it is
[02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:22.300]   to actually make an anaerobic bacteria.
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:24.220]   And so, this is kind of an odd company
[02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:25.860]   'cause it's a supplement company,
[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:29.180]   but they have to basically adhere to pharma GMP conditions
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:32.540]   to make it because of the anaerobic vats
[02:18:32.540 --> 02:18:35.220]   that you have to use infused with nitrogen
[02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:37.220]   to be able to make an anaerobic bacteria.
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:39.220]   So, anyway, so I take three of their products.
[02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:41.180]   I take something called Glucose Control,
[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:44.020]   I take Polyphenol, and I take Akkermansia.
[02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:45.940]   - Okay. - And I think that's the list.
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:47.020]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:49.620]   - I'll try and move through my list pretty quickly.
[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:51.060]   I may miss one or two things,
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:53.500]   and I don't know, maybe we'll put the list someplace online
[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:55.460]   and fill in any gaps.
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:59.180]   I definitely take AG1.
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:01.340]   You know, that's my typical ad read.
[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:02.540]   I've been doing it since 2012.
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:03.380]   That's true.
[02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:07.620]   Take one or two servings a day, three if I'm traveling,
[02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:11.180]   and I'll generally do that first thing in the morning
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:13.840]   or in the evening.
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.300]   For me, it's really about capping off the vitamin minerals
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:22.400]   that I might be lacking in my diet,
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:26.940]   and also the whole adaptogen business, I think,
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:28.420]   and polyphenols.
[02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:31.620]   And I'm very interested in Pendulum
[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:34.300]   because part of the reason I take AG1
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:36.640]   is for the gut health aspect.
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:41.420]   I think just bowel movements are more where I'd want them.
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:43.820]   I mean, it sounds kind of weird to talk about,
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:47.140]   but you just feel better when your gut motility is right.
[02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:48.940]   I feel like it adjusts my gut motility
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:50.860]   so it's neither too fast nor too slow.
[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:53.680]   So that's first and foremost.
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:57.560]   I take a quality fish oil,
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:03.460]   either the one that AG makes or Carlson's in liquid form
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:05.260]   that has that lemon flavoring,
[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:08.760]   and I make sure I get above one gram per day of EPA.
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:11.900]   So that's usually a tablespoon, sometimes two tablespoons.
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:17.140]   I make sure that I get enough D3,
[02:20:17.140 --> 02:20:18.900]   typically from the dropper,
[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:20.980]   5,000 IU per day, approximately.
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:22.980]   Sometimes 3,000, sometimes 7,000.
[02:20:22.980 --> 02:20:24.140]   I kind of play around that.
[02:20:24.140 --> 02:20:25.580]   And I test my blood levels.
[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:28.380]   I also take methyl B12.
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:32.220]   And I also take Tonga Ali.
[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:34.940]   So I take one capsule of that in the early part of the day.
[02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:38.340]   That has lowered my sex hormone binding globulin,
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:40.220]   freeing up a bit more testosterone.
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:41.280]   That's why I like it.
[02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:47.180]   And I take a couple of green tea capsules in the morning.
[02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:48.180]   I drink yerba mate.
[02:20:48.180 --> 02:20:49.740]   That's more of a stimulatory effect.
[02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:52.860]   And I take the NMN in powder form, sometimes NR as well.
[02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:54.280]   And again, if I run out of that,
[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:56.060]   I tend to go long periods of time without.
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:58.940]   I use Element as an electrolyte.
[02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:01.820]   So people are probably noticing this is all pretty basic.
[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:06.080]   I take, in my case, 10 grams of creatine monohydrate per day.
[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:07.160]   I sometimes forget to take it.
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:08.180]   That's why I take 10 grams.
[02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:09.460]   I'll sometimes miss a day.
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:13.700]   And I certainly feel the effects of that in the gym
[02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:16.380]   because of the greater water volume in the muscles.
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:18.900]   But there are a lot of data on creatine monohydrate
[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:21.640]   for sake of either maintaining or offsetting
[02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:23.100]   some of the cognitive dysfunction
[02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:25.260]   associated with sleep deprivation,
[02:21:25.260 --> 02:21:28.440]   maybe aging altitude and some other things as well.
[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:30.940]   And then for a few months,
[02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:35.940]   I was playing around with, let's say, nicotine gums.
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:38.280]   I stopped doing that.
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:39.340]   First of all, I was dipping it
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:42.340]   and I ended up lifting for an entire episode
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:46.860]   of the Lex Friedman Podcast that I only realized later.
[02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:48.900]   So I stopped taking it also
[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.900]   because it gave me a kind of a tick and cough
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:52.620]   when I wasn't chewing it.
[02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:54.780]   And then I felt like I needed to chew it
[02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:56.820]   and it's a little too stimulatory for me.
[02:21:56.820 --> 02:22:01.220]   Before sleep, I take magnesium threonate,
[02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:03.500]   really bullish on magnesium as well.
[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:05.780]   Apigenin, 50 milligrams,
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:09.660]   which is essentially chamomile extract and theanine.
[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:13.660]   And occasionally I'll take 900 milligrams inositol also,
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:16.420]   or instead, I kind of mix those up and around.
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:18.180]   And then I use a quality whey protein
[02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:20.920]   as a protein replacement, that kind of thing.
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:24.100]   And I've played around with various things like Sheila G
[02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:27.540]   and sometimes get the sense that it's having an effect,
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:30.480]   but then I'll stop taking it for long periods of time.
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:33.980]   There are very few things that I've stayed with
[02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:35.440]   for long periods of time.
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:37.940]   And I basically just described what those are.
[02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:40.500]   You know, if ever someone were to design a supplement
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:44.380]   that would provide more energy all day long
[02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:46.440]   that wasn't caffeine, I'd probably look to that,
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:50.140]   but I ingest caffeine in the form of yerba mate and coffee.
[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:54.580]   I've played around with caffeine tablets,
[02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:55.540]   you know, taking, you know,
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:58.020]   50 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form.
[02:22:58.020 --> 02:22:59.540]   I mentioned that only because it has
[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:01.380]   a distinctly different feel
[02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:04.500]   than ingesting caffeine through liquid form.
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:07.320]   It feels stronger and I don't know why that is.
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:09.560]   In fact, there's a very well-known podcaster
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:12.120]   who drinks peppermint tea and takes caffeine tablets
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:15.380]   as a way to, I don't know, drink peppermint tea,
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:16.800]   which sounds very nice and mellow,
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:19.000]   but also get the stimulant effect.
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.760]   So anyway, that's pretty much it.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:22.800]   And then I do a lot of things as I know you do,
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:24.880]   mainly based on suggestions you've made
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:26.080]   about getting zone two cardio,
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:29.260]   rucking, weight vest walks and hikes,
[02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:31.640]   three times a week resistance training,
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:33.800]   three times a week cardiovascular training,
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:36.240]   one long, one medium, one short.
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:39.360]   And I try and hit the sauna and the cold once a week.
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:42.720]   And yeah, that's pretty much it.
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:45.400]   I think there are a bunch of other supplements
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:47.840]   that are really interesting and kind of fun to play with
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:51.680]   if one wants to, like 600 milligrams of alpha GPC
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:54.880]   or 900 milligrams of alpha GPC in a double espresso
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:57.980]   prior to a workout, you feel different, it's a stimulant.
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:23:59.360]   But I don't like to do that too often
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.600]   because of the increase in TMAO that occurs.
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.480]   And then you have to take 600 milligrams of garlic
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:05.520]   to offset that increase and you start getting-
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:07.160]   - If we believe TMAO matters.
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:08.720]   - Right, if you believe TMAO matters.
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:10.080]   - I don't. - Okay, great.
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:11.880]   Even better, I'll maybe skip the garlic.
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:15.000]   So things like that, I prefer to just eat garlic anyway.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.040]   So there are a bunch of things like that
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:19.520]   that are kind of fun to play with as pre-workouts,
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:23.680]   but yeah, that's the core supplement regimen.
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:26.180]   And it's the one I've stuck with for, gosh,
[02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:30.240]   at least 10 years, or in the case of AG,
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:32.440]   more than, you know, more than that.
[02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:36.560]   So I should say, because any discussion around supplements,
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:37.720]   I think it's going to, you know,
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:39.160]   have people pricking up their ears to,
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:40.880]   okay, this is like a sales pitch or something.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.600]   I absolutely want to go on record.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:46.600]   The things you choose to do and not do
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:49.640]   are going to have much greater effect
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:52.320]   on your healthspan and lifespan,
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:54.140]   that is the behavioral things, in particular,
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:57.520]   sleep, exercise, nutrition, sunlight, et cetera,
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:24:59.480]   than any one supplement that you're going to take.
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:01.320]   So I do view supplements, I think,
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:02.480]   through the appropriate lens,
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:05.120]   which is that they are indeed a supplement.
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:08.440]   They are not necessary.
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:10.720]   Many of them are simply sufficient
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:14.280]   to serve as an insurance policy
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:17.440]   or to augment mental and physical health,
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:21.080]   maybe longevity, in ways that make it worthwhile,
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:23.080]   given my disposable income
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:24.700]   that I want to devote to supplements.
[02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:27.440]   But I don't think you need them.
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:31.720]   - Yeah, I'll go even more extreme on that statement.
[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:34.520]   Everything we have talked about on this podcast today,
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:39.120]   whether it be NR, NAD, NMN, theracumin, magnesium,
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:41.200]   this supplement, that supplement,
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:45.440]   all of that stuff, while potentially mattering,
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:48.120]   I would put in the category of,
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:51.800]   was the Titanic serving lobster or steak?
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:56.320]   Look, I like steak more than lobster.
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:58.320]   That's a relative discussion.
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:02.320]   Exercise, sleep, nutrition, emotional health
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:07.400]   is the question of what was the heading of the Titanic.
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:09.520]   Okay, so I just want people to understand
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:12.400]   the magnitude of what we're talking about.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:16.080]   How you eat, how you sleep, how you train,
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:18.280]   and how you take care of your mental health
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:22.240]   is the equivalent of what direction was the Titanic going
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:24.640]   with respect to the iceberg.
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:27.600]   All this supplement bullshit that we just talked about
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:30.320]   is equivalent to, were they serving lobster
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:31.920]   or were they serving steak?
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:34.600]   And was the band playing this song or that song?
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:36.760]   I'm not saying those things don't matter,
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:38.960]   but just put them in the context
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:41.000]   of the direction the Titanic is going.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.360]   - Okay, so I completely agree with you.
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:45.400]   Exercise, sleep, nutrition, and emotional health,
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:47.160]   not listed in any particular order.
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:48.720]   Peter and I both completely agree.
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:50.120]   Those are the critical four.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.360]   Before we close NR, NMN, NAD, and NAD in particular,
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.520]   how do we view this?
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:01.440]   Is it a pathway that we should be focusing on
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:03.880]   in terms of supplementation or infusions
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:05.720]   for sake of extending our life?
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:08.360]   My answer on that is no.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:09.840]   - Yeah, I would say the same.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:11.280]   I don't remember who said this,
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:14.640]   but someone, maybe it was Nassim Taleb said,
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:15.680]   don't tell me what you think,
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:17.640]   show me what's in your portfolio.
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:19.600]   Like, meaning people who pontificate
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:21.200]   about this stock versus that stock,
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:23.240]   he's kind of like, assuming it was him that said this,
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:26.400]   he's like, okay, I don't care what you're telling me.
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:27.800]   Tell me what you own.
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:30.040]   That's gonna show me your conviction.
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:32.080]   So through that lens, look,
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:33.920]   I'll show you my conviction on exercise.
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:34.760]   I'll show you what I do.
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:36.280]   I'll show you my conviction on sleep.
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:37.240]   This is what I do.
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:40.060]   I'll show you my conviction on all these other things.
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:43.840]   I mean, I don't take these supplements, full stop.
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:45.160]   I don't take them 'cause I can't afford.
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:46.600]   It's not that I can't afford them.
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:48.400]   It's not that there are any inconvenience
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:49.360]   to me to take them.
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.280]   I passionately do not believe they do anything for me.
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:56.020]   And why would I waste time, money,
[02:27:56.020 --> 02:27:58.680]   anything on something that I really don't believe
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:27:59.820]   makes a difference?
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:03.600]   Now, again, I am always happy to be proven wrong.
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:07.120]   And I am very happy to say that two years from now,
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:09.600]   five years from now, we could be doing this exercise again.
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.620]   And in the presence of new information,
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:13.240]   maybe I'm not taking rapamycin
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:17.440]   and maybe I am fist-fulling, you know, NR and NMN.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.280]   Possible.
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:20.580]   I will reserve the right to change my mind
[02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:23.100]   for the rest of my life in the presence of new data.
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:26.740]   But as it stands today, I do not take these supplements
[02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:28.720]   and I have no foreseeable plan to do so
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:30.420]   until information changes.
[02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:32.440]   - Great, thank you for that clear stance
[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:35.260]   and the willingness to change it in light of new data.
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:36.780]   Peter, so good to sit down with you again
[02:28:36.780 --> 02:28:39.500]   and talk science, talk health.
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:41.140]   And in this case, talk about the supplements
[02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:43.020]   that we're not going to take.
[02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:45.420]   In addition to the ones that we do take.
[02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:48.100]   We will do this again sometime very soon, hopefully.
[02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:49.440]   - In Austin.
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:50.980]   - Would love that.
[02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:51.980]   Thanks, Peter.
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:52.980]   - Thanks, man.
[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:54.100]   - Thank you for joining me today
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:56.860]   for my discussion with Dr. Peter Atiyah.

[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:17.660]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.300]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:22.260]   or topics or guests that you'd like me to consider
[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:23.860]   for the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:26.220]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:29:26.220 --> 02:29:27.880]   I do read all the comments.
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:29.980]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:29:29.980 --> 02:29:32.880]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:36.500]   So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.740]   Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:39.820]   And on all those platforms,
[02:29:39.820 --> 02:29:41.860]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:43.380]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:44.840]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:46.620]   other of which is distinct from the content
[02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:47.820]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:29:47.820 --> 02:29:51.320]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:52.620]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:54.300]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:55.740]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:57.780]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:29:59.520]   that includes what we call protocols
[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:01.860]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:04.460]   on everything from neuroplasticity and learning
[02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:08.140]   to optimizing your sleep, to improving dopamine regulation,
[02:30:08.140 --> 02:30:10.100]   to foundational fitness protocol
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:12.200]   that includes both resistance training
[02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:13.500]   and cardiovascular training.
[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:15.000]   It details sets and reps.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.300]   All of that and more is completely zero cost.
[02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:20.060]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:22.300]   go to the menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:23.380]   and provide your email.
[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:24.220]   And I should point out
[02:30:24.220 --> 02:30:26.380]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:28.800]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:32.420]   all about NAD and longevity with Dr. Peter Attia.
[02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:34.660]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:36.700]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:39.280]   [upbeat music]
[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.860]   (upbeat music)
