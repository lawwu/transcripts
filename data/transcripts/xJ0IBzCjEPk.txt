[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.940]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.440]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.840]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.640]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.460]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.540]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.680]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.900]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.660]   to the general public.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.060]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.540]   Our first sponsor is Belcampo Meat Company.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.960]   Belcampo Meat Company is a regenerative farm
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.140]   in Northern California that raises organic, grass-fed,
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.500]   and grass-finished certified humane meats.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.360]   I eat meat about once a day.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.760]   I'm neither pure carnivore nor am I a vegetarian,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.040]   obviously, I eat meat.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.000]   The way I eat is I tend to fast until about noon,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.380]   and then I have my first meal,
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.760]   which generally consists of a piece of beef,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.580]   you know, it's either ground beef or a steak.
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.400]   I like ribeyes, I like flat irons, these kinds of things,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.940]   and a small salad, sometimes a large salad.
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.420]   And then throughout the day,
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.620]   I generally am low carb until the evening
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.020]   when I eat pasta and rice and things of that sort.
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.820]   Eating that way is what optimizes my levels of alertness
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.660]   and optimizes my sleep.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.620]   I've talked about this on previous podcast episodes.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.240]   Now, because I eat meat essentially every day,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.500]   the source of that meat is extremely important to me.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.900]   I want it to be healthy for me,
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.600]   and I want the animals that it comes from to be healthy
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.980]   and to have lived a good life.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.480]   Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.840]   and they eat a diet of inflammatory grains,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.040]   which is terrible for them,
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.560]   and it's terrible for us when we eat those meats.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.920]   Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.180]   and seasonal grasses,
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.200]   which results in meat that is higher in nutrients
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.140]   and healthy fats.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.940]   They actually have very high levels of omega-3s,
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.760]   which I've also talked about on this podcast
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.780]   are important for mental and physical health
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.660]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.340]   The way Belcampo raises its animals
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.900]   is also good for the environment.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.780]   They practice regenerative agriculture,
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.940]   which means it's climate positive and carbon negative,
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.820]   which translates to good for us and good for the planet.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.060]   You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.100]   to be delivered straight to your door using my code Huberman
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.980]   by going to belcampo.com/huberman,

[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.060]   That's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.560]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.240]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.860]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.580]   to help you better understand your body
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.680]   and reach your health goals.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.620]   I've long been a believer in getting blood work done
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.580]   for the simple reason that many,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.900]   if not most of the factors
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.720]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.100]   can only be assessed from a blood test.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.880]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.440]   we can get additional information
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.740]   about our current health status and our health trajectory.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.560]   One of the major problems with blood tests and DNA tests
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.880]   available for most sources is that you get the numbers back
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.920]   and you can easily see whether or not those numbers
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.520]   are within the standard range or outside the range,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.280]   but it's very hard to know what to do with that information.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.440]   Also, what the various factors are that are being measured
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.200]   is often very cryptic.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.120]   With Inside Tracker, they clarify everything.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   They make it very clear and simple
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.080]   as to what each of those factors relates to.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.520]   So they give you some understanding of what those are
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.680]   and they give you ideas and suggestions
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.280]   about things that you can do with your lifestyle,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.320]   changes to your diet, changes to your supplementation,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.760]   changes to your sleep schedule or exercise patterns
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.280]   that can serve to optimize the levels
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.480]   of those various factors and your DNA.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.400]   In addition, they have something called the Inner Age Test,
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000]   which compares your chronological age,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.560]   which you already know, with your biological age,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.680]   which gives you a sense of your lifespan
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.120]   or predicted lifespan.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.840]   So that's crucially important.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.080]   And you can imagine why many people, including me,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.800]   would want that information.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.400]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.600]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.300]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.080]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.380]   I've been using Athletic Greens for well over a decade now.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.960]   I started using Athletic Greens
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.440]   and I still use Athletic Greens
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   because I find it rather dizzying
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.920]   to know which vitamins and minerals to take.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.520]   And with Athletic Greens,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.320]   I cover all my bases of vitamins and minerals.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.160]   In addition, it has probiotics.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.800]   And we now know from an enormous number
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.400]   of quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.760]   that the gut microbiome is critically important
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.900]   for our immune system function,
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.920]   for the gut brain axis and for our mental functions.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.600]   And probiotics are one way to support the gut brain axis
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.800]   and the gut health generally.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.720]   With Athletic Greens, I basically just add water,
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.080]   put in a little bit of lemon juice
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.400]   'cause that's the way I like it,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.720]   mix it up, it tastes delicious.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.500]   I'll do that once or twice a day.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.640]   It's compatible with fasting, at least for me.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.360]   It doesn't take me out of a fasting mode,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.760]   which I do early in the day.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.840]   So most often I'll have my Athletic Greens early in the day
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.120]   and then sometimes I'll also have another one
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.600]   late in the evening or sometimes even before bed.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.740]   I'm able to sleep after drinking it without a problem.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.680]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.560]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.280]   And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.200]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.680]   which are these little packs that make it very easy
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.720]   to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.560]   or in the car or on a plane,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.120]   makes all of that very simple.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.280]   And in addition, they will give you a year supply
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.540]   of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.760]   There are also a lot of data supporting the fact
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.400]   that vitamin D3 is critical for a variety of health metrics.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.340]   We all know that we can get vitamin D3 from the sun,
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.320]   but many people, including me,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.560]   we're not getting enough sunlight or D3.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.040]   Even if I was getting a lot of sunlight,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.120]   I know that 'cause I had my blood levels measured of D3.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.140]   So I use vitamin D3 every day
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.980]   in addition to the other things I take,
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.160]   including Athletic Greens.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.080]   If you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.560]   you'll get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.320]   and a year supply of the vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.520]   That's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.680]   to claim the special offer.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.640]   This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.520]   we're talking all about physical performance.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.380]   So that means athletic performance, recreational exercise,
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.120]   weightlifting, running, swimming, yoga,
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.320]   skills and skill learning.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.200]   Today, we're going to talk about and focus on skill learning.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.700]   We are going to focus on how to learn skills more quickly,
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.600]   in particular motor skills.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.280]   This will also translate to things like musical skills
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.520]   and playing instruments,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.080]   but we're mainly going to focus on physical movements
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.320]   of the body that extend beyond the hands,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.520]   like just playing the piano
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.800]   or the fingers like playing the guitar.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.520]   But everything we're going to talk about
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.240]   will also serve the formation and the consolidation
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.740]   and the performance of other types of skills.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.180]   So if you're interested in how to perform better,
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.160]   whether or not it's dance or yoga,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.120]   or even something that's just very repetitive
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.860]   like running or swimming, this podcast episode is for you.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.480]   We're going to go deep into the science of skill learning,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.100]   and we are going to talk about very specific protocols
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.240]   that the science points to and has verified
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.700]   allow you to learn more quickly,
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.520]   to embed that learning so that you remember it,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.360]   and to be able to build up skills more quickly
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.220]   than you would otherwise.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.100]   We are also going to touch on a few things
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.660]   that I get asked about a lot, but fortunately recently,
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.820]   I've had the time to go deep into the literature,
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.720]   extract the data for you, and that's mental visualization.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.740]   How does visualizing a particular skill or practice
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.800]   serve the learning and or the consolidation
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.960]   of that practice?
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.360]   Turns out there are some absolutely striking protocols
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.960]   that one can use, striking meaning they allow you
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.160]   to learn faster and they allow you to remember
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.320]   how to do things more quickly and better
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   than if you were not doing this mental rehearsal,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.580]   but the pattern of mental rehearsal,
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.640]   and when you do that mental rehearsal
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.900]   turns out to be vitally important.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.160]   So I'm excited for today's episode.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.920]   We're going to share a lot of information with you,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.200]   and there are going to be a lot of very simple takeaways.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.080]   So let's get started.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.540]   Before we get into the topic of skill learning
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.020]   and tools for accelerating skill learning,
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.620]   I want to briefly revisit the topic of temperature,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.520]   which was covered in the last episode,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.140]   and just highlight a few things
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.180]   and clear up some misunderstandings.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.240]   So last episode talked about these incredible data
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.320]   from my colleague Craig Heller's lab at Stanford,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.960]   he's in the Department of Biology,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.040]   showing that cooling the palms in particular ways
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.080]   and at particular times can allow athletes
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.520]   or just recreational exercisers to do more pull-ups, dips,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.660]   bench presses per unit time, to run further,
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.940]   to cycle further and to feel better doing it.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.320]   There really are incredible data that are anchored
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   in the biology of the vascular system, the blood supply,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.000]   and how it's involved in cooling us.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Many of you, dozens of you in fact, said, wait a second,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.600]   you gave us a protocol in this episode,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.880]   which says that we should cool our palms periodically
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.320]   throughout exercise in order to be able to do more work.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   But on the episode before that on growth hormone
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.400]   and thyroid hormone, you said that heating up the body
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.080]   is good for release of growth hormone.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.800]   And I just want to clarify that both things are true.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.440]   These are two separate protocols.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.600]   You should always warm up before you exercise.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.080]   That warm up will not increase your body temperature
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.540]   or the muscle temperature to the point where it's going
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.520]   to diminish your work capacity,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.280]   that it's going to harm your performance.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.280]   The cooling of the palms, which is really just a route
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.480]   to cool your core in an efficient way,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.600]   the most efficient way in fact,
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.560]   is about improving performance.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.800]   Heating up the body with exercise
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.640]   and focusing on heat increases or using sauna
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.140]   for heat increases is geared toward growth hormone release,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.680]   which is a separate matter.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.740]   So you can do both of these protocols,
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.400]   but you would want to do them at separate times.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.280]   So just to make this very concrete
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.040]   before I move on to today's topic,
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.840]   if you're interested in doing more work,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.320]   being able to do more sets and reps per unit time
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.920]   and feel better doing it or to run further
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.200]   or to cycle further, then cooling the palms periodically
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.340]   as I described in the previous episode
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.760]   is going to be the way to go.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.420]   If you're interested in getting growth hormone release,
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.700]   well then hot sauna and I offered some other tools
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.560]   if you don't have a sauna in the episode on growth hormone
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.460]   and thyroid hormone is going to be the way to go.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.960]   So those are separate protocols.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.580]   You can include them in your fitness regime
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.080]   and your training regime,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.580]   but you do want to do them at separate times.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.840]   And as a last point about this,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.980]   I also mentioned that caffeine can either help
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.080]   or hinder performance depending on whether or not
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.420]   you're caffeine adapted because of the ways
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.840]   that caffeine impacts body temperature
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.560]   and all sorts of things like vasodilation and constriction.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.960]   It's very simple.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.760]   If you enjoy caffeine before your workouts
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.500]   and you're accustomed to caffeine,
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.760]   meaning you drink it three or five times or more a week,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.620]   100 to 300 milligrams is a typical daily dose of caffeine.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.580]   Some of you are ingesting more, some less.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.040]   If you do that regularly,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.900]   well then it's going to be just fine
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.600]   to ingest caffeine before you train.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.440]   It's not going to impact your body temperature
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.840]   and your vasodilation or constriction
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.880]   in ways that will hinder you.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.520]   However, if you're not a regular caffeine user
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.880]   and you're thinking, oh, I'm going to drink a cup of coffee
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.400]   and get this huge performance enhancing effect.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.200]   Well, that's not going to happen.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.240]   Chances are it's going to lead to
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.160]   increases in body temperature
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.400]   and changes in the way that blood flow
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.240]   is happening in your body and in particular
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.640]   on these palmer surfaces and in your face
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.880]   that is going to likely diminish performance.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.000]   So if you enjoy caffeine and you're accustomed to it,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.800]   so-called caffeine adapted, enjoy it before your training.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.360]   If you regularly, excuse me,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.280]   if you do not regularly use caffeine,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.660]   then you probably do not want to view caffeine
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.320]   as a performance enhancing tool.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.920]   And while we're on the topic of tools
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.720]   and because this is a month on athletic performance
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.060]   and exercise and physical skill learning,
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.720]   I want to offer an additional tool
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.000]   that I've certainly found useful,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.440]   which is how to relieve the so-called side stitch
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.340]   or side cramp when running or swimming.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.480]   This actually relates to respiration
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.360]   and to the nervous system.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.040]   And it is not a cramp.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.000]   If you've ever been out running
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.480]   and you felt like you had a pain on your side,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.880]   that pain could be any number of things,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.400]   but that what feels like cramping of your side
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.880]   is actually due to what's called collateralization
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.400]   of the phrenic nerve,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.600]   which is a lot harder to say than a side cramp
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.000]   or a side stitch.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.080]   But here's the situation.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.480]   You have a set of nerves,
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.960]   which is called the phrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.680]   the phrenic nerve, which extends down
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.620]   from your brainstem essentially, this region,
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.660]   to your diaphragm to control your breathing.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.280]   It has a collateral, meaning it has a branch,
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.000]   just like the branch on a tree that innervates your liver.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.920]   And if you are not breathing deeply enough,
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.600]   what can happen is you can get
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.980]   what's called sometimes a referenced pain.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.900]   Referenced pain is probably going to be familiar
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.560]   to any of you who have ever read
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.240]   about how to recognize heart attack.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.400]   You know, people who have heart attacks
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.640]   will sometimes have pain on one side of their body,
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.840]   the left arm.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.240]   Sometimes people that have pain in a part of their back
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.200]   will suddenly also get pain in their shoulder
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.040]   or part of their face.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.080]   This has to do with the fact
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.080]   that many of our nerves branch
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.920]   and are meaning they're collateralized
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.700]   to different organs and areas of the body.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.960]   And the way those nerves are woven together,
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.140]   it's often the case that if we disrupt the pattern of firing
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.420]   of electrical activity in one of those nerve branches,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.500]   that the other ones are affected too.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.420]   The side stitch, the pain in your side,
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.100]   is often because of the contractions of the diaphragm
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.700]   because of the way you're breathing while you're exercising,
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.340]   running or swimming or biking.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.460]   And as a consequence, you feel pain in your side,
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.460]   but that's not a cramp.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.780]   The way to relieve it is very simple.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.480]   You do the physiological side that I've talked about
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.040]   in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere,
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.820]   which is a double inhale through the nose, very deep,
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.020]   and then a long exhale.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.440]   And you might want to repeat that two or three times.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.880]   Typically, that will relieve the side stitch
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.700]   because of the way that it changes the firing patterns
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.400]   of the phrenic nerve.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.080]   So the side stitch is annoying, it's painful,
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.760]   sometimes where you think we're dehydrated
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.960]   and you might be dehydrated,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.220]   but oftentimes it's just that we're breathing in a way
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.460]   that causes some referenced pain of the liver.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.180]   We call it a side stitch or a side cramp,
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.700]   and you can relieve it very easily
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.980]   through the double inhale, long exhale.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.720]   That pattern, done two or three times.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.560]   Often you can continue to engage in the exercise
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.820]   while you do the double inhale, exhale,
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.980]   and it will just relieve itself that way.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.780]   So give it a try if you experience the side stitch.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.620]   Some people I know are also doing the double inhale,
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.860]   long exhale during long continuous bouts of exercise.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.680]   I actually do this when I run.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.040]   We have decent data,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.720]   although these are still unpublished data
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.220]   that can engage a kind of regular cadence
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.820]   of heart rate variability.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.780]   So there are a number of reasons
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.260]   why this physiological side can be useful,
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.060]   but it certainly can be useful for relieving the side stitch
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.660]   or so-called side cramp.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.440]   Let's talk about the acquisition of new skills.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.540]   These could be skills such as a golf swing
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.540]   or a tennis swing, or you're shooting free throws,
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.500]   or you're learning to dance,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.740]   or you're learning an instrument.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.500]   I'm mainly going to focus on athletic performance.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.920]   There are basically two types of skills,
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.760]   open loop and closed loop.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.300]   Open loop skills are skills
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.740]   where you perform some sort of motor action
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.520]   and then you wait and you get immediate feedback
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.960]   as to whether or not it was done correctly or not.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.980]   A good example will be throwing darts at a dartboard.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.900]   So if you throw the dart,
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.240]   you get feedback about whether or not you hit the bullseye,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.720]   you're off the dartboard,
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.580]   or you're some other location on the dartboard.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.640]   That's open loop.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.120]   Closed loop would be something that's more continuous.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.720]   So let's say you're a runner
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.260]   and you're starting to do some speed work and some sprints,
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.460]   and you're running and you can kind of feel
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.640]   whether or not you're running correctly
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.660]   or maybe you even have a coach
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.900]   and they're correcting your stride
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.760]   or you're trying to do some sort of skill
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.960]   like a hopscotch skill,
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.000]   which maybe you're doing the ladder work
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.880]   where you're stepping between designated spaces
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.020]   on the ground, that's closed loop.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.300]   Because as you go, you can adjust your behavior
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.380]   and you can adjust the distance of your steps
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.400]   or you can adjust your speed
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.320]   or you can adjust your posture.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.140]   And you are able to essentially do more practice
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.340]   per unit time,
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.240]   but you're getting feedback on a moment to moment basis.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.120]   Okay, so you have open loop and closed loop.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.400]   And just to make this very, very clear,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.880]   open loop would be practicing your tennis serve.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.960]   So let's say that you set a target
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.480]   on the other side of the net,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.920]   you throw the ball up and you hit the ball,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.980]   it goes over, that's open loop.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.720]   You'll know whether or not you were in the court,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.600]   you were on the location you wanted to hit
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.100]   or close to it or not.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.220]   That's open loop.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.880]   Closed loop would be if you're in a regular case.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.160]   So maybe you're learning a swim stroke
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.660]   or maybe you're trying to learn a particular rhythm
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.500]   on the drums.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.040]   So maybe you're trying to learn a particular beat.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.320]   I'm not very musical, so I'm not going to embarrass myself
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.760]   by giving an example of this, although later I will.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.540]   Where you're trying to get a particular rhythm down
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.000]   and if you're not getting it, you can adjust in real time
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.760]   and try and catch up or slow down or speed up, et cetera.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.080]   Okay, so hopefully you'll understand open loop
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.540]   and closed loop.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.940]   You should always know before you try and learn a skill
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.740]   whether or not it's open loop or closed loop
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.440]   and I'll return to why that's important shortly.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.940]   But if you want to learn something,
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.020]   ask is it open loop or closed loop?
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.500]   There are essentially three components of any skill
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.480]   that involves motor movement.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.520]   And those are sensory perception,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.900]   actually perceiving what you are doing
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.140]   and what's happening around you.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.400]   So what you see, what you hear.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.720]   Sometimes you're paying attention
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.140]   to what you're doing specifically,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.940]   like the trajectory of your arm
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.560]   or how you're moving your feet if you're learning to dance.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.080]   Sometimes you're more focused on something
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.560]   that's happening outside of you.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.780]   Like you're listening for something in music
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.700]   or you're paying attention
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.180]   to the way your partner is moving, et cetera.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.240]   So there's sensory input.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.300]   Then there are the actual movements.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.320]   Okay, so there are the movements of your limbs and body.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.900]   And then there's something called proprioception.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.380]   And proprioception is often discussed
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.080]   as kind of a sixth sense of knowing where your limbs are
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.100]   in relation to your body.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.100]   So proprioception is vitally important.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.180]   If I reach down and pick up this pen and pick it up,
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.980]   I'm not thinking about where the pen in my hand is
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.900]   relative to my body, but proprioceptively,
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.980]   I'm aware of it at kind of a sixth
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.100]   and deeper subconscious level.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.260]   I can also make myself aware of where my limbs are.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.360]   And typically when we learn,
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.180]   we are placing more focus on proprioception
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.960]   than we do ordinarily.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.580]   So if I get up from this chair
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.380]   and I happen to walk out of the room,
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.320]   I don't think about where my feet are landing
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.820]   relative to one another.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.380]   But if my leg had fallen asleep
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.060]   because I had been leaning on one of the nerves of my leg
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.360]   or something like that,
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.640]   and my leg feels all tingly or numb,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.300]   I and you, if this were to happen,
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.900]   you would immediately notice a shift in gait.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.740]   It would feel strange.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.420]   I'd have to pay attention to how I'm stepping.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.540]   And the reason is I'm not getting
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.140]   any proprioceptive feedback.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.800]   Now, skill learning has a lot of other dimensions too,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.380]   but those are the main ones that we're going to focus on.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.620]   So just to remind you,
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.460]   you need to know open loop or closed loop,
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.420]   and you need to know whether or not,
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.480]   excuse me, you need to know that there's sensory perception,
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.300]   what you're paying attention to,
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.460]   movements themselves, and proprioception.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.380]   And there's one other important thing that you need to know,
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.620]   which is that movement of any kind is generated
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.680]   from one, two, or three sources within your nervous system,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.860]   within your brain and body.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.480]   These are central pattern generators,
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.860]   which are sometimes called CSPGs.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.260]   Excuse me, CPGSs.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.160]   CSPGs are something entirely different in biology.
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.960]   CPGSs, this just goes to show that I have a module.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.180]   CSPGs are chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.820]   They have nothing to do with this topic.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.860]   CPGSs are central pattern generators,
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.340]   or CPGs they're sometimes called.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.340]   These CPGs are in your spinal cord, mine and yours,
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.940]   different ones, and they generate repetitive movements.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.020]   So if you're walking, if you're running, if you're cycling,
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.300]   if you're breathing, which presumably you are,
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.660]   and you're doing that in a regular rhythmic cadence,
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.780]   central pattern generators are controlling that movement.
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.500]   After you learn how to walk, run, swim, cycle,
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.180]   do anything really, much of the work is handed off
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.620]   to the central pattern generators.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.500]   And there were experiments that were done
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.780]   in the '60s, '70s, and '80s
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.220]   that actually looked at decerebrate animals
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.820]   and even decerebrate humans.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.600]   These are humans and animals that lack a cerebral cortex.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.280]   They lack much of the brain and yet they can engage
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.620]   in what's called a fictive movement.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.700]   So it sounds like a kind of barbaric experiment.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.540]   I'm glad I wasn't the one to have to do them,
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.580]   but this is the stuff of neuroscience textbooks
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.580]   that cats or dogs or mice that have their neocortex removed,
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.540]   put them on a treadmill, they'll walk just fine.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.780]   And they will adjust their speed of walking just fine
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.180]   even though they basically lack
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.660]   all their thinking decision-making brain.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.540]   And it turns out humans that have, unfortunately,
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.320]   massive strokes to their cortex and lack any neocortex,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.080]   but preserve the central pattern generators
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.500]   will also walk just fine
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.860]   even though they lack any of the other stuff in the brain.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.260]   So these CPGs or CPGSs are amazing
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.940]   and they control a lot of our already learned behavior.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.900]   When you're really good at something,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.020]   CPGs are controlling a lot of that behavior.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.720]   And that's true also for a golf swing,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.660]   even if it's not really repetitive.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.780]   Somebody who's really good at golf is going to,
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.540]   I guess you call it a T, you put the ball on the T,
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:32.740]   I show my knowledge of golf.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.440]   I've only done mini golf, frankly,
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.700]   but someday maybe I'll learn how to golf,
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.440]   but you set the golf ball down and swing,
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.880]   set the golf ball down, swing.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.820]   Central pattern generators are going to handle a lot of that.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.540]   If I were to go to the golf course,
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.940]   Stanford has a beautiful golf course.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.840]   If I were to go out there and put a ball on the T,
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.080]   my central pattern generators
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.220]   would not be involved in that at all.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.420]   The moment I get bringing the club back to swing,
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.820]   it's going to engage other things.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.640]   And the other things that's going to engage,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.140]   because I don't know that behavior now or then,
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.460]   is upper motor neurons.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.540]   We have motor neurons in our cortex,
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.220]   in our neocortex that control deliberate action.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.480]   And those are the ones that you're engaging
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.160]   when you are learning.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.360]   Those are the ones that you have to pay attention
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.080]   in order to engage.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.300]   And that's what's happening, for instance,
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.340]   if I decide I'm going to reach down and pick up my pen,
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.620]   which I rarely think about, but now I'm thinking about it
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.960]   and I'm going to do this in a very deliberate way.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.680]   I'm going to grab with these two fingers and lift,
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.620]   my upper motor neurons are now involved.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.300]   So upper motor neurons are very important
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.440]   because a little bit later in the episode,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.360]   when we talk about how to use visualization
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.000]   in order to accelerate skill learning,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.460]   it's going to leverage these upper motor neurons
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.080]   in very particular ways, okay?
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.740]   So we have CPGs for rhythmic movement,
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.820]   upper motor neurons for deliberate unlearned movements
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.700]   or movements that we are in the process of learning.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.440]   And then we have what are called lower motor neurons.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.960]   Lower motor neurons are the ones in our spinal cord
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.820]   that send little wires out to our muscles,
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.860]   which actually cause the firing of those muscle fibers, okay?
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.440]   So the way to think about this
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.800]   is you've got upper motor neurons,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.620]   which talk to CPGs and to lower motor neurons.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.060]   So it's really simple.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.320]   And now you know most everything there is to know
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.300]   about the neural pathways controlling movement,
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.420]   at least for sake of this discussion.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.220]   So anytime we learn something,
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.900]   we have to decide what to place our sensory perception on,
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.340]   meaning what are we going to focus on?
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.180]   That's critical.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.000]   If you're listening to this
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.420]   and you're the type of person who likes taking notes,
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.660]   this should be the second question you ask.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.800]   Remember, the first question is, is it open loop
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.000]   or closed loop?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.780]   The second question should be,
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.160]   what should I focus my attention on?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.220]   Auditory attention, visual attention or proprioception.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.340]   Should I focus on where my limbs are relative to my body
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.780]   or should I focus on the outcome?
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.600]   Okay, this is a critical distinction.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.980]   You can decide to learn how to do a golf swing
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.660]   or learn how to shoot free throws
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.080]   or learn how to dance tango
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.020]   and decide that you are going to focus on
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.740]   the movements of your partner
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.340]   or the positions of your feet.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.100]   You maybe are going to look at them.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.900]   Maybe you're going to sense them.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.940]   You're going to actually feel where they are
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.180]   or maybe you're going to sense the position
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.820]   and posture of your body, which is more proprioceptive.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.180]   Okay, so you have to allocate your attention
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.460]   and I'm going to tell you how to allocate your attention
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.460]   best in order to learn faster.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.740]   So these are the sorts of decisions that you have to make.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.840]   Fortunately for you, you don't have to think about
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.480]   whether or not you're going to use your upper motor neurons
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.500]   and your lower motor neurons or not
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.940]   because if you don't know how to do something,
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.460]   you're automatically going to engage
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.360]   your upper motor neurons.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.500]   And if you do, you are all right,
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.280]   then you're not going to use your upper motor neurons.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.800]   You're mainly going to rely on central pattern generators.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.940]   You are always using your lower motor neurons
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.100]   to move muscle.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.760]   So we can really simplify things now.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.220]   I've given you a lot of information, but we can simplify it.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.360]   Basically open loop or closed loop, that's one question.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.120]   And what am I going to focus on?
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.800]   And then your neurology will take care of the rest.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.680]   So now I want to talk about realistic expectations.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.440]   Somewhere in Hollywood, presumably,
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.880]   it got embedded in somebody's mind
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.400]   that instant skill acquisition was possible.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.460]   That you could take a particular pill
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.100]   or you could touch a particular object
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.820]   or you could have a wand wave over you
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.620]   and you would suddenly have a skill.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.660]   And so that is the result of Hollywood at all.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.660]   It doesn't exist, at least not in reality.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.000]   And I love movies, but it simply doesn't exist.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.620]   Then the self-help literature created another rule
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.260]   called the 10,000 hours rule.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.900]   And frankly, that doesn't really match the literature,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.000]   at least the scientific literature either.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.860]   I like it because it implies that learning takes time,
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.600]   which is more accurate than the Hollywood at all
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.960]   instant skill acquisition rule,
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.680]   which isn't really a rule, it's a myth.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.480]   But the 10,000 hours rule overlooks something crucial,
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   which is that it's not about hours, it's about repetitions.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.520]   Now, of course, there's a relationship
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.440]   between time and repetitions,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.820]   but there are some beautiful experiments
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.820]   that point to the fact that by simple adjustment
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.540]   of what you are focused on
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.360]   as you attempt to learn a new skill,
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.640]   you can adjust the number of repetitions that you do,
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.800]   you adjust your motivation for learning,
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.320]   and you can vastly accelerate learning.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.220]   Some of you may recognize this by its internet name,
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.920]   which is not a scientific term,
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.180]   which is the Super Mario effect.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.020]   There's actually a quite good video on YouTube
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.720]   describing the Super Mario effect.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.580]   I think it was a YouTuber who has,
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.040]   I think, a background in science.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   And he did an interesting experiment,
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.740]   and I'll talk about his experiment first,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.700]   and then I will talk about the neurobiology
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.180]   that supports the result that he got.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.220]   The Super Mario effect
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.120]   relates to the game Super Mario Brothers,
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.120]   but you'll see why at the end.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.780]   But basically what they did was they had 50,000 subjects,
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.140]   which is a enormous number of subjects,
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.320]   learn a program,
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.200]   essentially taking words from a computer program
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.700]   or the commands for a computer program
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.960]   that were kind of clustered in a column on the right.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.320]   So these are the sorts of things
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.520]   that computer programmers will be familiar with,
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.720]   but other people won't.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.080]   And those commands are essentially,
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.400]   they essentially translate to things like go forward,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.500]   and then if it's a right-hand turn in the maze,
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.720]   then go right and continue
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.760]   until you hit a choice point, et cetera.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.420]   So it's a bunch of instructions,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.840]   but the job of the subjects in these experiments
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.160]   were to organize those instructions in a particular way
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.240]   that would allow a little cursor
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.680]   to move through the maze successfully, okay?
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.340]   So basically the goal was,
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.160]   or at least what the subjects were told,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.080]   is that anyone can learn to computer program,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.840]   and if somebody can just organize the instructions
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   in the right way,
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.740]   then they can program this little cursor
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.540]   to move through a maze, very simple.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.760]   And yet, if you don't have any background
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   in computer programming, or even if you do,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.040]   it takes some skill.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.700]   You have to know what commands to give
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.720]   in what particular order,
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.760]   and they made that very easy.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   You could just assemble them in a list over onto the right.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.680]   So people started doing this.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.360]   Now, there were two groups,
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.640]   and one half of the subjects,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.700]   if they got it wrong,
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.180]   meaning they entered a command and the cursor would move,
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.920]   and it was the wrong command
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.000]   for this little cursor to move through the maze,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.880]   they saw a signal jump up on their screen that said,
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.600]   "That did not work, please try again."
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.420]   That's it.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.640]   If they put in the wrong command
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.600]   or it was in the wrong sequence,
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.160]   it would say, "That did not work, please try again."
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.360]   And then the subjects would reorganize the instructions,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.760]   and then the little cursor would continue.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.560]   And if they got it wrong again,
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.200]   it would say, "That did not work, please try again."
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.720]   The other half of the subjects,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.160]   if they got something wrong,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.160]   were told, "You just lost five points, please continue."
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.880]   So that's the only difference in the feedback that they got.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.320]   Now, I have to confess,
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.740]   I would have predicted,
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.980]   based on my knowledge of dopamine circuitry
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   and reward contingency and epinephrine and stress
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.380]   and motivated learning,
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.700]   and this other thing that we've been told
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.820]   in many, many books on behavioral economics
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.120]   and in the self-help literature,
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.740]   which is that people will work much harder
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.080]   to prevent losing something
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.600]   than they will to gain something,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.360]   that you hear all the time.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.080]   And it turns out that that's not at all what happened.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.700]   If they looked at the success rate of the subjects,
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.820]   what they found was that the subjects that were told,
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.720]   "That did not work, please try again,"
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.940]   had a 68% success rate.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.780]   68% of them went on to successfully program
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.960]   this cursor moving through the maze.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.220]   Whereas the ones that were told,
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.060]   "You lost five points," had a 52% success rate,
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.460]   which is a significant difference.
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.860]   But the source of the success
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.020]   or the lack of success is really interesting.
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.780]   The subjects that were told,
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.960]   "That did not work, please try again,"
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.920]   tried many, many more times per unit time.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.680]   In other words, they made more attempts
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.880]   at programming this thing
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.300]   to allow this cursor to move through the maze.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.440]   Whereas the people that were told,
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:07.140]   "You lost five points," gave up earlier or gave up entirely.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.380]   Okay, so let's just step back from this
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.140]   because to me, this was very surprising.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.220]   It violates a lot of things that I had heard
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.040]   in the kind of popular culture or the self-help literature
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.860]   that people will work much harder to avoid losing something
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.540]   than they will to gain something.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.380]   And it didn't really fit with what I understood
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.440]   about reward contingencies and dopamine.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.520]   But it did fit well with another set of experiments
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.620]   that I'm very familiar with from the neuroscience literature
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.300]   and I'll give you the punchline first.
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.460]   And then we're going to take what these data mean
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.340]   and we're going to talk about a learning protocol
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.060]   that you can use that will allow you to learn skills faster
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:49.460]   by willingly participating in more repetitions
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.480]   of the skill learning.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.280]   Meaning you will want to do more repetitions
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.740]   even if you're getting it wrong some or most of the time.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.300]   So the experiment that I want to tell you about
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.820]   is called the tube test.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.940]   And this is generally done in mice,
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.520]   although it's sometimes been done in rats
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.460]   and it has a lot of parallels to some things
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.460]   that you've probably seen and experienced
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.340]   even in human life, in regular life,
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.200]   maybe even in your life.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.980]   So here's the experiment.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.260]   You take two rats, you put them in a tube
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.120]   or two mice, you put them in a tube.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.780]   And mice and rats, they don't like to share the same tube.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.500]   So what they'll do is they'll start pushing each other
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.540]   back and forth, back and forth.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.700]   Sooner or later, one of the rats or mice
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.780]   pushes the other one out.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.340]   The one that got pushed out is the loser,
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.000]   the one that gets the tube is the winner, okay?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.220]   Now you take the winner, you give it a new competitor.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:48.020]   And what you find is that the mouse or rat
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.900]   that won previously has a much higher than chance
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.700]   probability of winning the second time.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.580]   In other words, winning before leads to winning again.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.900]   And the reverse is also true.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.820]   If you take the loser and you put that loser in
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.980]   with another mouse, fresh mouse, new mouse,
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.660]   the loser typically will lose
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.100]   at much greater probability than chance.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.780]   And this is not related to differences in strength
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.640]   or size or testosterone or any other of the things
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.100]   that might leap to mind as explanations for this
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.460]   because those were all controlled for.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.600]   Now, that result had been known about for decades.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.520]   But three years ago, there was a paper published
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.500]   in the journal Science, phenomenal journal.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.980]   It's one of the three apex journals that examined
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.500]   the brain area that's involved in this.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.400]   Turns out it's a particular area of the frontal cortex
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.740]   for those of you that want to know.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.180]   And they did a simple experiment
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.500]   where the experimenters increased or decreased the activity
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.540]   of this brain area in the prefrontal cortex,
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.100]   little sub-region of the prefrontal cortex.
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.340]   And what they found is if they stimulated this brain area,
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.060]   a mouse or rat, regardless of whether or not
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.100]   it had been a winner or loser before
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.360]   became a winner every single time.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.720]   And they showed that if they blocked the activity
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.700]   of this brain area, regardless of whether or not
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.740]   the mouse or rat had been a winner or a loser,
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.900]   it became a loser every single time.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.620]   And this translated to other scenarios,
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.980]   other competitive scenarios,
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.860]   where they'd put a bunch of mice or rats
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.460]   in a kind of cool chamber.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.060]   They'd have a little heat lamp in the corner
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.100]   and mice like heat.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.340]   And there was only enough space for one mouse
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.300]   to be under the heat.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.340]   And the one that had one in the tube test
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.900]   or that had the brain area stimulated
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.940]   always got the nice warm spot.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.260]   So what is this magic brain area?
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.400]   What is it doing?
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.360]   Well, the reason I'm bringing this up today
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.720]   and the reason I'm bringing it up
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.820]   on the heels of the Super Mario effect
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.900]   is that stimulation of this brain area
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.940]   had a very simple and very important effect,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.340]   which was it led to more forward steps, more repetitions,
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.500]   more effort, but not in terms of sheer might and will,
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.740]   not digging deeper, just more repetitions per unit time.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:09.760]   And the losers had fewer repetitions per unit time.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.380]   So the Super Mario effect, this online experiment
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.180]   and the tube test, which has been done by various labs
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.820]   and repeated again and again,
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.180]   point to a simple but very important rule,
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.540]   which is neither the 10,000 hours rule
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.860]   nor the magic wand Hollywood version of learning,
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.460]   but rather the neurobiological explanation
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.260]   for learning a skill is you want to perform
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.520]   as many repetitions per unit time as you possibly can,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.780]   at least when you're first trying to learn a skill.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.600]   I want to repeat that.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.640]   You want to perform as many repetitions as you possibly can,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.400]   at least when you're first trying to learn a skill.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.620]   Now that might sound like a duh, it's just more reps,
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.060]   but it's not so obvious.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.360]   There's no reason why more repetitions
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.780]   should necessarily lead to faster learning
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.900]   because you could also say, well, more repetitions,
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.100]   you can make more errors.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.600]   And those errors would lead to poor performance,
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.880]   like misstepping a number of times.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.540]   And in these cases, there's very little feedback, right?
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.740]   It's not like every time the rat pushes forward
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.620]   or moves back that it is sensing, oh, I'm winning,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.660]   I'm losing, I'm winning, I'm losing on a micro level.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.860]   It probably does that as it starts to push the other one out
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.700]   the rat or mouse probably thinks I'm winning.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.500]   And as it's backing up, it's probably thinks I'm losing.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.880]   As you play the game, the Super Mario game,
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.040]   you are told, nope, that didn't work.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.100]   Nope, that didn't work, please try again.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.500]   But the important thing is that the winners
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.460]   are always generating more repetitions per unit time.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.740]   It's just a repeat of performance, repeat of performance,
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.120]   even if there are errors.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.040]   And that points to something vitally important,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.880]   which is reps are important,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.280]   but making error reps is also important.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.980]   In fact, it might be the most important factor.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.360]   So let's talk about errors
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.900]   and why those solve the problem of what to focus on.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.740]   Because as I said earlier, if you want to learn something,
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.280]   you need to know if it's open loop or closed loop,
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.360]   and you need to know what to focus on,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.960]   where to place your perception.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.080]   And that seems like a tough task,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.560]   but errors will tell you exactly what to focus on.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.600]   So let's talk about errors and why you can leverage errors
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   to accelerate skill learning.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.880]   Okay, so we've established
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.060]   that performing the maximum number of repetitions
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.640]   per training session is going to be advantageous.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.360]   And that might seem obvious,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.320]   but there's a shadowy side to that, which is,
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.000]   well, why would I want to just repeat the same thing
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.320]   over and over again if I'm getting it wrong 90% of the time?
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.240]   And the reason is that the errors
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.160]   actually cue your nervous system to two things,
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.340]   one, to error correction.
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.780]   And the other is it opens the door
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.900]   or the window for neuroplasticity.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.240]   Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's ability
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.560]   to change in response to experience,
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.420]   essentially to custom modify itself
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.920]   in order to perform anything better.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   We did an entire month on neuroplasticity
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.640]   and I talked a little bit about errors
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.060]   and why they're important.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.360]   Now we're going to make this very concrete
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.600]   and operationalize it, make it very actionable.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.880]   There was a paper that was published in 2021
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.580]   from Norman et al.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.020]   This is a very important paper.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.520]   It was published in the journal Neuron,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   which is a cell press journal, excellent journal.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.380]   The title of the paper gives it away essentially,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.480]   which is Post-Error Recruitment
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   of Frontal Sensory Cortical Projections Promotes Attention.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   Now, what that says is that when you make an error,
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:54.620]   it causes an activation of the brain areas
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.700]   that anchor your attention.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.940]   Remember, we need perception, attention,
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.240]   which they're essentially the same thing.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.360]   We need proprioception and we need the upper
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.740]   and lower motor neurons to communicate in the proper ways.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.800]   And this vital question is what to pay attention to.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.060]   Errors tell your nervous system
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.940]   that something needs to change.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.980]   So if you are performing a task or a skill,
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.160]   like you're learning how to dance
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.820]   and you're stepping on the other person's toes
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.260]   or you're fumbling or you're not getting it right,
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.340]   those errors are opening the possibility for plasticity.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.580]   If you walk away at that point,
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.700]   you've made the exact wrong choice, okay?
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.300]   Unless the errors are somehow hazardous to your health
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.540]   or somebody else's wellbeing,
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.260]   you want to continue to engage at a high repetition rate.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.700]   That's really where the learning is possible.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.700]   Without errors, the brain is not in a position
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.180]   to change itself.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:51.180]   Errors actually cue the frontal cortex networks,
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.460]   what we call top-down processing, and the neuromodulators,
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.140]   things like dopamine and acetylcholine and epinephrine,
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.980]   that will allow for plasticity.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.660]   So while the Super Mario experiment, the maze experiment,
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.120]   was only focused on generating errors,
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.020]   telling people that wasn't right, please try again,
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.780]   or that wasn't right, you lost five points,
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.740]   the key distinction is that the errors themselves
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.880]   cued people to the fact
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.140]   that they needed to change something.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.220]   So if you're trying to learn a new skill
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.420]   and you're screwing up and you're making mistakes,
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.900]   the more mistakes you make,
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.380]   the more plastic your brain becomes,
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.800]   such that when you get it right,
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.480]   that correct pattern will be rewarded and consolidated.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.340]   And you can trust that it will
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.820]   because the performance of something correctly
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.660]   is associated with the release
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.560]   of this neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.580]   Dopamine is involved in craving and motivation,
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.780]   it's involved in a lot of things,
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.980]   but it's also involved in learning.
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.960]   We will do an entire episode on dopamine and learning,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.820]   but because some of you are probably wondering,
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.500]   this does not mean that just increasing your dopamine levels
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.780]   before learning will allow you to learn faster.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.820]   In fact, increasing your dopamine levels
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.180]   before learning using pharmacology
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.900]   will actually reduce what's called the signal to noise.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.360]   It will make these increases in dopamine
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.100]   that pop up in your brain
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.720]   that suddenly make you realize, ah, I got that one right.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.500]   It will make those smaller
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.380]   relative to the background levels of dopamine, okay?
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.500]   You want a big spike in dopamine
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.020]   when you perform a motor pattern correctly
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.060]   and you want to make lots of errors,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.600]   many, many repetitions of errors
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.160]   in order to get to that correct performance.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.940]   Now, if you're like most people,
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.740]   you're going to do this in a way that's somewhat random,
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.420]   meaning, let's say it's a tennis serve.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.580]   I can't play tennis.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.840]   I think I've probably played tennis twice.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.500]   So if I throw the ball up in the air and hit it,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.540]   I'm going to get it wrong and probably hit the net.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.380]   Then I'm going to hit the net.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.720]   Then I'll probably go too long,
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.140]   then I'll probably go over the fence.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.840]   At some point, I like to think I'll get it correct.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.500]   The dopamine signal for that is going to be quite big
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.540]   and I'll think, okay, what did I do there?
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.300]   I actually don't know, I wasn't paying attention.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.260]   What I was paying attention to
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.680]   is whether or not the ball went to the correct location
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.740]   on the opposite side of the net.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.580]   Remember, it's an open loop move.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.820]   So I don't actually know what I did correctly,
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.200]   but your nervous system will take care of that
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.660]   provided I, in this case,
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.140]   complete more and more and more repetitions.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.020]   Now, if I were to just elevate my basal level of dopamine
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.000]   by taking, I don't know,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.060]   1,500 milligrams of L-tyrosine or something,
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.460]   that would be bad because the increase in dopamine
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.680]   would actually be much lower, right?
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.340]   We would say the delta is smaller.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.260]   The signal to noise is smaller
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.780]   if my overall levels of dopamine are very, very high.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.800]   So I'm actually going to learn less well.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.420]   So for skill learning, motor skill learning,
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.100]   increasing your dopamine levels prior is not a good idea.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.540]   It might help with motivation to get to the learning,
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.460]   but it's not going to improve the plasticity process itself
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.940]   and it's likely to hinder it.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.620]   And so that's very important.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:58.620]   So these errors cue the brain that something was wrong
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.940]   and they open up the possibility for plasticity.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.820]   It's what's sometimes called the framing effect.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.620]   It frames what's important.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.820]   And so I think this is a shift
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.900]   that we've heard about growth mindset,
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:14.240]   which is the incredible discovery and theory and practice
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.820]   of my colleague, Carol Dweck at Stanford.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.740]   This is distinct from that, right?
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.060]   This isn't about motivation to learn.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.540]   This is about how you actually learn.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.740]   So the key is designate a particular block of time
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.700]   that you are going to perform repetitions.
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.960]   So maybe that's 30 minutes.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.160]   Maybe that's an hour.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.740]   Work for time and then try and perform the maximum number
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.140]   of repetitions that you can do safely
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:39.020]   for you and others per unit time.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.640]   That's going to be the best way
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.020]   to approach learning for most sessions.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.420]   I will talk about other things that one can do,
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.200]   but making errors is key.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.700]   And this isn't a motivational speech.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.360]   I'm not saying, oh, go make errors.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.260]   Errors are good for you.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.780]   You have to fail in order to win.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.500]   No, you have to fail in order to open up the possibility
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.360]   of plasticity, but you have to fail many times
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.160]   within the same session.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.060]   And those failures will cue your attention
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.880]   to the appropriate sensory events.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.060]   Now, sometimes we're working with a coach.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.700]   And so this is a shout out to all the coaches.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.780]   Thank you for doing what you do.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.200]   However, there needs to be,
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.620]   at least what the scientific literature say,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.940]   there needs to be a period of each training session
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:25.400]   whereby the athlete or the person of any kind
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.760]   can simply pay attention to their errors
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.020]   without their attention being cued to something else.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.540]   A really well-trained coach will say,
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.580]   oh, you know, your elbow's swinging too high
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.440]   or you're not gripping the racket
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.340]   in the appropriate way, et cetera.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.860]   They can see things that the practitioner can't see.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.000]   And of course that's vitally important.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.780]   But the practitioner also needs
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.940]   to use this error recognition signal.
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.940]   They need to basically focus on something
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.160]   and the errors are going to tell them what to focus on.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.420]   So put simply, there needs to be a period of time
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.380]   in which it's just repetition after repetition
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.220]   after repetition.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.460]   I think many people, including coaches,
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.400]   are afraid that bad habits will get ingrained.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.060]   And while indeed that's possible,
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.480]   it's very important that these errors occur
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.720]   in order to cue the attentional systems
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.920]   and to open the door for plasticity.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.840]   So if I'm told, look, you know, I'm standing a little wide,
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.800]   I need to tighten up my stance a little bit, great.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.680]   But then I need to generate many repetitions
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.340]   from that tightened stance, okay?
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.460]   So if I'm constantly being cued from the outside
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.260]   about what I'm doing incorrectly,
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.460]   that's not going to be as efficient, okay?
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.920]   So for some people, these learning sessions
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.820]   might be 10 minutes.
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.340]   For some people, it might be an hour.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.800]   Whatever you can allocate, because your lifestyles will vary
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.000]   and whether or not you're a professional athlete, et cetera,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.500]   will vary, you want to get the maximum number
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.540]   of repetitions in and you want to make errors.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.800]   That's allowing for plasticity.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.460]   So science points to the fact
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.500]   that there's a particular sequencing of learning sessions
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.360]   that will allow you to learn faster
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.740]   and to retain the skill learning.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.000]   And it involves doing exactly as I just described,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.080]   which is getting as many repetitions as you can
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.340]   in the learning session,
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.120]   paying attention to the errors that you make,
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.640]   and then the rewards that will be generated,
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.580]   again, these are neurochemical rewards,
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.900]   from the successful performance of a movement
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.360]   or the approximate successful performance.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.940]   So maybe you get the golf swing better, but not perfect,
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.300]   but that's still going to be rewarded
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.620]   with this neurochemical mechanism.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.700]   And then after the session,
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.440]   you need to do something very specific, which is nothing.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.660]   That's right.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:45.100]   There are beautiful data describing neurons
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.100]   in our hippocampus.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.920]   This area of our brain involved
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.960]   in the consolidation of new memories.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.900]   Those data point to the fact that in sleep,
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.180]   there's a replay of the sequence of neurons
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.940]   that were involved in certain behaviors the previous day,
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.360]   and sometimes the previous day before that.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.500]   However, there are also data that show
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.060]   that after a skill learning session,
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.020]   any kind of motor movement,
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.700]   provided you're not bringing in a lot more additional
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.200]   new sensory stimuli,
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.420]   there's a replay of the motor sequence
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.760]   that you performed correctly,
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.920]   and there's an elimination of the motor sequences
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.380]   that you performed incorrectly,
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.700]   and they are run backward in time, okay?
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.600]   So to be very clear about this,
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.860]   if I were to learn a new skill or navigate a new city,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.940]   or let's just stay with the motor skill,
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.140]   let's say the free throw or a golf swing or a tennis serve,
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.440]   dance move, novice,
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.940]   so I'm still going to make a lot of errors,
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.020]   don't get it perfectly,
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.180]   but maybe I get a little bit better
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.720]   where I perform it correctly three times out of 1,000,
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.100]   and it sounds like something I might do,
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.900]   and there I'm probably being generous to myself.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.840]   After I finished the training session,
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.860]   if I do nothing,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.900]   I'm not focused on some additional learning,
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.580]   I'm not bringing a lot of sensory information in.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.500]   If I just sit there and close my eyes
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.700]   for five to 10 minutes,
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.460]   even one minute,
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.220]   the brain starts to replay the motor sequence
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:28.120]   of the corresponding to the correct pattern of movement,
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.860]   but it plays that sequence backward.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:34.300]   Now, why it plays it backward, we don't know.
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.300]   If I were to wait until sleep,
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.340]   or regardless of when I sleep later that night,
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.320]   the sequence will be replayed forwards
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.400]   in the proper sequence.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.420]   Immediately afterward, it's played backward
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.620]   for reasons that are still unclear,
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.620]   but the replay of that sequence backwards
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.260]   appears to be important
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.040]   for the consolidation of the skill learning.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.560]   Now, this is important
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.060]   because many people are finishing their jujitsu class,
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.600]   or they're finishing their yoga class,
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.100]   or they're finishing their dance class,
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.820]   or they're finishing some skill learning,
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.240]   and then they're immediately devoting their attention
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.280]   to something else.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.100]   You hear a lot about visualization,
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.640]   and we are going to talk about visualization,
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.220]   but in the kind of obsession with the idea
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.940]   that we can learn things just sitting there
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.740]   with our eyes closed without having to perform a movement,
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.460]   we've overlooked something perhaps even more important,
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.820]   or at least equally important,
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.100]   which is after skill learning,
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.300]   after putting effort into something,
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.580]   sitting quietly with the eyes closed
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.640]   for one to five to 10 minutes
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.380]   allows the brain to replay the sequence
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.460]   in a way that appears important
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:50.860]   for the more rapid consolidation of the motor sequence
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.580]   of the pattern and to accelerated learning.
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.840]   If you'd like to learn more about this,
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.540]   this is not work that I was involved in.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.940]   I want to be very clear.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.000]   There's an excellent paper that covers this and much more
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.740]   for those of you that really want to dive deep on this,
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.780]   and we will dive deeper in a moment.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.820]   This is a review that was published in the journal Neuron,
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.040]   excellent journal.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.860]   Many of the papers that I'm referring to
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.100]   were covered in this review,
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.940]   which is titled Neuroplasticity
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:20.620]   Subserving Motor Skill Learning by Dayan,
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.060]   D-A-Y-A-N, I hope I'm not butchering the pronunciation,
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.900]   and Cohen by Leonard Cohen,
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:29.940]   but not the Leonard Cohen most of us are familiar with,
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.460]   the musician Leonard Cohen.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.020]   Dayan and Cohen Neuroplasticity Subserving Motor Skill
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.020]   Learning, and this was published in 2011,
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:43.820]   but there've been a number of updates
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.720]   and the literature that I've described
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.780]   in other portions of today's episode
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.540]   come from the more recent literature,
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.040]   such as the more recent 2021 paper, okay?
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.740]   So you have this basic learning session
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.160]   and then a period of time afterwards
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.500]   in which the brain can rehearse what it just did.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.340]   We hear so much about mental rehearsal
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.940]   and we always think about mental rehearsal
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.720]   as the thing you do before you train or instead of training,
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.940]   but this is rehearsal that's done afterward
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.380]   where the brain is just automatically scripting
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.120]   through the sequence and for some reason,
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.380]   that's still not clear as to why this would be the case,
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.780]   it runs backward.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.540]   Then in sleep, it runs forwards and certainly,
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.440]   absolutely sleep and quality sleep
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.940]   of the appropriate duration, et cetera,
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.900]   is going to be important for learning of all kinds,
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:29.900]   including skill learning.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.980]   We did an entire four episodes on sleep
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.020]   and how to get better at sleeping.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.560]   Those are the episodes back in January,
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.260]   episodes essentially one, two, three, and four,
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:42.300]   and maybe even episode five, I don't recall,
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.340]   but you can go there to find out
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.840]   all about how to get better at sleeping.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.140]   Now, there are other training sessions involved, right?
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.760]   I'm not going to learn the perfect golf swing
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:54.740]   or the tennis serve or how to dance in one session
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.300]   and I doubt you will either.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.540]   So the question is when to come back
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.120]   and what to do when you come back to the training session.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:07.340]   Now, first of all, this principle of errors,
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:11.840]   cuing attention and opening the opportunity for plasticity,
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.400]   that's never going to change.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.220]   That's going to be true for somebody who is hyper skilled,
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:21.540]   who's even has mastery or even virtuosity
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.800]   in a given skill, right?
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.340]   Remember, when you're unskilled at something,
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.820]   uncertainty is very high, as you become more skilled,
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.640]   certainty goes up, right?
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.780]   Then eventually you achieve levels of mastery
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.700]   where certainty is very, very high
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.100]   about your ability to perform yours,
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.820]   certainty and that of other people.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:42.760]   And then there's this fourth category of virtuosity
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.820]   where somebody, maybe you,
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.280]   invites uncertainty back into the practice
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.220]   because only with that uncertainty
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.700]   can you express your full range of abilities,
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:54.020]   which you aren't even aware of
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.880]   until uncertainty comes into the picture, right?
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.820]   I happen to have the great privilege
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:03.080]   of being friends with Laird Hamilton,
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.400]   the big wave surfer who is phenomenal.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.500]   I don't surf.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.240]   I certainly don't surf with Laird,
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:12.420]   but he and another guy that he surfs with, Luca Padua,
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:16.240]   these guys, they're virtuosos at surfing.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.280]   They don't just want the wave that they can master.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.540]   They want uncertainty.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:22.180]   They're at the point in their practice
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.780]   where when uncertainty shows up,
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.200]   like a wave that's either so big
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.020]   or is moving in a particular way
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.960]   that it brings an element of uncertainty for them
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.660]   about what they're going to do,
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.460]   they recognize that as the opportunity
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.940]   to perform better than they would otherwise, okay?
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.380]   So they're actually trying to eliminate uncertainty.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.260]   At the beginning of learning any skill
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.420]   and as we approach from uncertain to skilled to mastery,
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.380]   we want to reduce uncertainty.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.980]   And that's really what the nervous system is doing.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.340]   It's trying to eliminate errors
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.000]   and hone in on the correct trajectories.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.660]   If you perform a lot of repetitions
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:02.740]   and then you use a period immediately after,
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.960]   we don't really have a name for this.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.180]   Maybe someone will come up with it
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.840]   and put it in the comment section if you're on YouTube,
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.460]   if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:11.420]   a name for this post-learning
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.100]   kind of idle time for the brain.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.300]   The brain isn't idle at all.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.740]   It's actually scripting all these things in reverse
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.460]   that allow for deeper learning and more quick learning.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.380]   But if we fill that time with other things,
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.180]   if we are focused on our phones
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.880]   or we're focused on learning something else,
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.580]   we're focusing on our performance,
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.220]   that's not going to serve us well.
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.220]   It's at least it's not going to serve
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.060]   the skill learning well.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.420]   So please, if you're interested
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.440]   in more rapid skill learning,
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.820]   try introducing these sessions.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.660]   They can be quite powerful.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.300]   And then on subsequent sessions,
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.180]   presumably after a night's sleep,
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.660]   or maybe you're doing two sessions a day,
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.540]   although two sessions a day is going to be a lot
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.320]   for most people, unless you're a professional
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.080]   or a high level athlete.
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:55.660]   The subsequent sessions are where you get
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:59.420]   to express the gains of the previous session, right?
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:03.140]   Where you get to perform well, presumably more often,
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.060]   even if it's just subtle,
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.060]   sometimes there'll be a decrease in performance,
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.780]   but most often you're going to perform better
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:12.320]   on subsequent and subsequent training sessions.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.340]   And there is the opportunity to devote attention
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.900]   in very specific ways, right?
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.120]   Not just let the errors inform you
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.460]   where to place your attention,
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:27.580]   but rather to direct your perception
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.120]   to particular elements of the movement
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.000]   in order to accelerate learning further, okay?
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.980]   So to be very clear,
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.700]   'cause I know many of you are interested
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.780]   in concrete protocols,
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.220]   it's not just that you would only let errors
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.260]   cue your attention on the first session.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.980]   You might do that for one session or five sessions.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.020]   It's going to depend.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.720]   But once you're familiar with something
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.060]   and you're performing it well every once in a while,
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.700]   you're accomplishing it better every once in a while,
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.420]   then you can start to cue your attention
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.420]   in very deliberate ways.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.140]   And the question therefore becomes
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.500]   what to cue your attention to.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.580]   And the good news is it doesn't matter.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:10.480]   There is a beautiful set of experiments that have been done
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:15.420]   looking at sequences of keys being played on a piano.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:18.100]   This is work that was published just a couple of years ago.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.020]   There are actually several papers now
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.060]   that are focused on this.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:24.340]   One of them was published in 2018.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:29.340]   This is from Claudia Lape and colleagues, L-A-P-P-E.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.880]   She's done some really nice work,
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.900]   which talks about the influence of pitch feedback
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.100]   on learning of motor timing and sequencing.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.660]   And this was done with piano,
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.160]   but it carries over to athletic performance as well.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.300]   So I'm going to describe this study to you.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.940]   But before I describe it,
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.580]   what is so interesting about this study
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.220]   that I want you to know about
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:53.740]   is that it turns out it doesn't matter so much
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:57.020]   what you pay attention to during the learning sequence,
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.880]   provided it's something related to the motor behavior
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.720]   that you're performing, right?
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.260]   That seems incredible, right?
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.380]   I'm not good at a tennis serve.
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:07.900]   So if I've done, you know,
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.880]   let's say a thousand repetitions of the tennis serve,
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.060]   maybe I got it right three to 10 times.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.700]   Now I'm being even more generous with myself
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:16.080]   and I do this post-training session
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.600]   where I let my brain idle and I get some good sleep
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:21.980]   and I come back and now I start generating errors again,
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.720]   presumably or hopefully fewer errors,
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.540]   but I decide I'm going to cue my attention
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.620]   to something very specific,
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:30.820]   like maybe how tightly I'm holding the racket,
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:32.260]   or maybe it's my stance,
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:36.120]   or maybe it's whether or not I rotate my right shoulder in
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.700]   as I hit the ball across and I'm making this up again,
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.220]   I don't play tennis.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:43.340]   Turns out that as long as it's the same thing
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.220]   throughout the session, learning is accelerated.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:50.620]   And I'll explain why this makes sense in a moment,
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.660]   but just to be really clear,
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:57.660]   you can and one should use your powers of attention
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.540]   to direct your attention to particular aspects
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.380]   of a motor movement.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.440]   Once you're familiar with the general theme of the movement,
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.540]   but what you pay attention to exactly is not important.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.060]   What's important is that you pay attention
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.020]   to one specific thing.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.020]   So what Claudia Lappe and colleagues showed
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.060]   was that if people are trying to learn a sequence of keys
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:21.460]   on the piano, there are multiple forms of feedback.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.700]   There are error signals.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.340]   If for instance, they hear a piece of music
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.580]   and then they're told to press the keys
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:30.940]   in a particular sequence and the noise that comes out,
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.460]   the sound that comes out of the piano
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.740]   does not sound like the song they just heard, right?
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.780]   So instead of, and here forgive me
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.940]   because I'm neither musical nor can I sing,
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:45.940]   but instead of they hear that and then instead
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:50.580]   when they play or for me, it would sound something like,
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.660]   it wouldn't sound right.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.720]   Okay, it wouldn't sound right
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.640]   because I likely got the sequence wrong
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.180]   or I was pressing too hard on the keys
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.600]   or too lightly on the keys, et cetera.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:06.620]   What they showed was if they just instruct people
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:10.020]   about the correct sequence to press on the keys,
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.500]   it actually doesn't matter what sound comes back
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   provided it's the correct sound or it's the same sound.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.280]   All right, so here's the experiment.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.020]   They had people press on these keys
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.940]   and it was a typical piano
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.220]   and it generated the particular sequence of sounds
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.660]   that would be generated by pressing the keys on the piano.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:33.060]   Or they modified the keyboard in this case or piano
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.820]   such that when people pressed on the keys,
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.880]   a random tone, different tones were played
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.500]   each time they pressed on the keys.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.020]   So it sounded crazy, it sounded like noise,
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.180]   but the motor sequence was the same.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.680]   Or they had a single tone
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.360]   that was played every time they pressed a key
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.380]   and the job or the task of the subject
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.260]   was just to press the keys in the proper sequence.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.100]   So instead of, [vocalizing]
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.400]   it was just, [vocalizing]
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.720]   instead of, [vocalizing]
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.080]   it's even hard for me to say an even tone,
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:10.980]   but you get the idea.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.260]   So a singular tone,
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.940]   just think a doorbell being rung
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.860]   with each press of the key would be really annoying, okay?
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.760]   But it turns out that the rate to motor learning
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:27.060]   was the same whether or not they were getting feedback
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.260]   that was accurate to the keys of the piano
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.980]   or whether or not it was a constant tone.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.820]   Performance was terrible
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.740]   and the rates of learning were terrible
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.140]   if they were getting random tones back.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.680]   So what this means is that learning to play the piano,
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.460]   at least at these early stages,
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.240]   is really just about generating the motor commands.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.340]   It's not about paying attention to the sound
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.300]   that's coming out of the piano.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.300]   And this makes sense because when we are beginners,
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.320]   we are trying to focus our attention
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.700]   on the things that we can control.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.660]   And if you think about this, if you conceptualize this,
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.420]   pressing the keys on the piano and paying attention
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.920]   to the sounds that are coming out are two things.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.220]   So what this means is that as you get deeper
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.420]   and deeper into a practice,
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.980]   focusing purely on the motor execution can be beneficial.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.940]   Now, this is going to be harder to do
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.740]   with open loop type things where you're getting feedback.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.320]   I guess a good example of open loop
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.220]   would be the attempt at a back flip, right?
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.300]   If you get it wrong, you will immediately know.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.160]   If you get it right, you'll immediately know.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.820]   Please don't go out and try and do a back flip
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.840]   on the solid ground or even on a trampoline
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.300]   if you don't know what you're doing
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.180]   because very likely you'll get it wrong
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.340]   and you'll get injured.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:44.160]   But if it's something that is closed loop
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.920]   where you can repeat again and again and again and again,
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.340]   that is advantageous because you can perform
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:52.940]   many, many repetitions and you can start to focus
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.460]   or learn to focus your attention
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.040]   just on the pattern of movement.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.620]   In other words, you can learn to play the piano
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.440]   just as fast or maybe even faster
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.300]   by just focusing on the sequence
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.320]   that you are moving your digits, your fingers,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.760]   and not the feedback.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.640]   Now, I'm sure there are music teachers out there
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.960]   and piano teachers that are screaming,
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.120]   "No, you're going to ruin the practice
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.800]   that all of us have embedded in our minds
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.980]   and in our students."
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.000]   And I agree, at some point,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.360]   you need to start including feedback
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.280]   about whether or not things sound correct.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.600]   But one of the beauties of skill learning
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.040]   is that you can choose to parameterize it,
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.900]   meaning you can choose to just focus on the motor sequence
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.260]   or just focus on the sounds that are coming back
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.500]   and then integrate those.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.800]   And so we hear a lot about chunking,
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.460]   about breaking things down into their component parts.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:43.580]   But one of the biggest challenges for skill learning
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.760]   is knowing where to place your attention.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.200]   So to dial out again,
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.640]   we're building a protocol across this episode.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.700]   Early sessions, maybe it's the first one,
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.520]   maybe it's the first 10, maybe it's the first 100.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.220]   It depends on how many repetitions you're packing in.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.980]   But during those initial sessions,
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.640]   the key is to make many errors,
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.480]   to let the reward process govern the plasticity,
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.880]   let the errors open the plasticity,
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.920]   and then after the learning sessions,
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.940]   to let the brain go idle,
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.220]   at least for a short period of time.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.780]   And of course, to maximize sleep.
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.100]   As you start incorporating more sessions,
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:19.780]   you start to gain some skill level,
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.020]   learning to harness and focus your attention
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.340]   on particular features of the movement
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.860]   independent of the rewards and the feedback, right?
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.220]   So the reward is no longer in the tone
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.420]   coming from the piano,
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.340]   or whether or not you struck the target correctly,
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:38.120]   but simply the motor movement focusing your,
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.340]   for instance, in a dart throw on the action of your arm,
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.620]   that is embedding the plasticity
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.580]   in the motor pattern most deeply.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.020]   That's what's been shown by the scientific literature.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.940]   I'm sure there are coaches and teachers out there
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.820]   that will entirely disagree with me, and that's great.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.980]   Please let me know what you prefer.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.700]   Let me know where you think this is wrong.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.180]   And it rarely happens,
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.820]   but let me know where you think this might be right as well.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.360]   So we're breaking the learning process
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.340]   down into its component parts.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.060]   As we get more and more skilled,
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.540]   meaning as we make fewer and fewer errors
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.740]   per a given session per unit time,
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:16.340]   that's when attention can start to migrate
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.620]   from one feature, such as the motor sequence,
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:24.100]   to another feature, which is perhaps one's stance,
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.740]   and another component of the sequence,
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:28.700]   which would be the result that's one getting
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.980]   on a trial to trial basis, right?
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.980]   So changing it up each time.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.220]   So maybe I serve the tennis ball
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.580]   and I'm focusing on where the ball lands,
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.120]   and then I'm focusing on the speed,
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.200]   then I'm focusing on my grip,
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.880]   then I'm focusing on my stance from trial to trial.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.100]   But until we've mastered the core motor movements,
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.300]   which is done session to session,
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.260]   that, at least according to the literature
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:55.220]   that I have access to here, seems to be suboptimal.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.540]   So hopefully this is starting to make sense,
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.140]   which is that these connections
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.300]   between upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons,
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.200]   and central pattern generators,
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.040]   you can't attack them all at once.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.460]   You can't try and change them all at once.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.180]   And so what we're doing is we're breaking things down
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.280]   into their component parts.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.480]   Some of you may be wondering about speed of movement.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.580]   There are some data, meaning some decent papers out there,
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:22.020]   showing that ultra slow movements,
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:26.020]   performing a movement essentially in slow motion
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.020]   can be beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:34.980]   However, at least from my read of the literature,
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:38.060]   it appears that ultra slow movements should be performed
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.520]   after some degree of proficiency has already been gained
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.260]   in that particular movement.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.060]   Now, that's not the way I would have thought about it.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.100]   I would have thought, well,
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.360]   if you're learning how to do a proper kick
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.700]   or a punch in martial arts
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.140]   or something that ultra slow movements at first
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.840]   are going to be the way that one can best learn
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.980]   how to perform a movement,
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.940]   and then you just gradually increase the speed.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.480]   And it turns out that's not the case.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.380]   And I probably should have known that.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.580]   And you should probably know that
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.400]   because it turns out that when you do ultra slow movements,
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.380]   two things aren't available to you.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:16.020]   One is the proprioceptive feedback is not accurate
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.860]   because fast movements of limbs are very different
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.780]   than slow movements of limbs.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:21.900]   So you don't get the opportunity
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:24.420]   to build in the proprioceptive feedback.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.120]   But the other reason why it doesn't work
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.340]   is that it's too accurate.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.420]   You don't generate errors.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.100]   And so the data that I was able to find
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.940]   showed that very slow movements can be beneficial
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:40.780]   if one is already proficient in a practice,
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:43.100]   but very slow movements at the beginning
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.360]   don't allow you to learn more quickly
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.020]   because you never generate errors
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.740]   and therefore the brain doesn't, it's not open for change.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:54.640]   The window for plasticity is never swung open, so to speak.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.940]   So brings us back to this theme
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:59.140]   that errors allow for plasticity,
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.780]   correct performance of movements
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.660]   or semi-correct performance of movements
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.020]   cues the synapses in the brain areas
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.540]   and spinal circuits that need to change.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.540]   And then those changes occur in the period
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.820]   immediately after skill learning and in sleep.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.620]   So super slow movements can be beneficial
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.500]   once you already have some proficiency.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.100]   So this might be standing in your living room
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.600]   and just in ultra slow motion performing your tennis serve,
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.380]   learning to or thinking about how you're adjusting your elbow
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.680]   and your arm and the trajectory,
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.280]   exactly how you were taught by your tennis coach,
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.260]   but trying to learn it that way from the outset
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.940]   does not appear to be the best way to learn a skill.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.220]   When should you start to introduce slow learning?
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.640]   Well, obviously talk to your coaches about this,
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.540]   but if you're doing this recreationally
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.460]   or you don't have a coach,
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.860]   I realize many of you don't,
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.140]   I don't have a coach for anything that I do.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.340]   I'm going to just navigating it
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.620]   by using the scientific literature.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.820]   It appears that once you're hitting success rates
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.220]   of about 25 or 30%,
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.800]   that's where the super slow movements
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.580]   can start to be beneficial.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.220]   But if you're still performing things
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:09.160]   at a rate of five or 10% correct and the rest are errors,
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.400]   then the super slow movements
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.160]   are probably not going to benefit you that much.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.240]   Also super slow movements are not really applicable
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.020]   to a lot of things.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:21.120]   For instance, you could imagine throwing a dart
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.300]   super slow motion,
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.600]   but if you actually try and throw an actual dart,
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.180]   the dart's just going to fall to the floor, obviously.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.260]   So there are a number of things like baseball bat swing,
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.800]   which you can practice in super slow motion.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.880]   But if you try and do that with an actual baseball
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.420]   or softball or something like that,
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:38.520]   that's not going to give you any kind of feedback
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.940]   about how effective it was.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:44.360]   So super slow movements or a decelerated movement
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.620]   has its place,
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.180]   but once you're already performing things reasonably well,
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.820]   like maybe 25 to 30% success rate.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:53.820]   You know, and I've tried this.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:57.460]   I actually, I struggle with basketball for whatever reason,
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.140]   and my free throw is terrible.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.260]   So I've practiced free throws in super slow motion
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.220]   and I nail them every time.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.260]   The problem is there's no ball.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.300]   Some of you already have a fair degree of proficiency
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:14.300]   of skill in a given practice or sport or instrument.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.100]   And if you're in this sort of advanced intermediate
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:22.660]   or advanced levels of proficiency for something,
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:27.000]   there is a practice that you can find interesting data for
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.660]   in the literature, which involves metronoming.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:35.660]   So this you'll realize relates to generating repetitions
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:39.140]   and it relates to the tone experiment
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:42.300]   where it doesn't really matter what your attention is queued
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.820]   to as long as you are performing many, many reps
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.820]   of the motor sequence.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.920]   You can use a metronome and obviously musicians do this,
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.300]   but athletes can do this too.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.820]   You can use a metronome to set the cadence
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.760]   of your repetitions.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.180]   Now for swimmers, there's actually a device
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.400]   I was able to find online.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.700]   I forget what the brand name was
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.260]   and that's not what this is about,
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.820]   but that actually goes in the swim cap
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.140]   that can cue you to when you need to perform another stroke.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.140]   And for runners, there are other metronome type devices
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.900]   that through headphones or through a tone in the room
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.960]   if you're running indoors or on a treadmill
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.620]   will cue you to when you basically
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:21.820]   you need to lift your heels.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.100]   And if you do that, what athletes find
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.300]   is they can perform more repetitions,
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.580]   they can generate more output, you can increase speed.
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.220]   A number of really interesting things are being done
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.660]   with auditory metronoming and then I'm involved
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.940]   in a little bit of work now that hopefully I'll be able
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.180]   to report back to you about using stroboscopic metronoming.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.020]   So actually changing the speed of the visual environment.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.700]   These are fun experiments,
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.380]   basically changing one's perception
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.100]   of how fast they're moving through space
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.980]   by playing with a visual system,
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.700]   something for a future discussion.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.620]   But you can start to use auditory metronoming
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.540]   for generating more movements per unit time
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.780]   and generating more errors and therefore more successes
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.620]   and more neuroplasticity.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.840]   There are a number of different apps out there.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.360]   I found several free apps
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.880]   where you can set in a metronome pace.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.280]   So it might be tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.760]   That's a little fast for most things,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.280]   but you can imagine if this were darts
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.740]   or this were golf swings that it might be tick, tick,
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.940]   tick, tick, or something more like tick, tick.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:23.300]   And every time the metronome goes, you swing.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.500]   Every time the metronome goes, you throw a dart.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.180]   There are actually some wild experiments out there.
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.860]   You know, there's a world championship of cup stacking.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.100]   There's a young lady who I saw could take all these cups
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.280]   spread out on a table and basically just stack them
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.120]   into the perfect pyramid and the least amount of times
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.520]   all the kids go wild.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.660]   This is something I'd never thought to pursue
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.840]   and frankly never will pursue
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.940]   unless my life depends on it for some reason,
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.260]   but it's really impressive.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.080]   And if you look at the sequence,
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.260]   'cause these have been recorded,
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:51.580]   you can look this up on YouTube.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.600]   What you'll find is that these expert cup stackers,
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.860]   it's just all about error elimination,
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:00.020]   but there too metronoming and auditory cues
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.640]   can actually cue them to pick up the cups faster
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.440]   than they would ordinarily and to learn to do that.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.500]   You can do this for anything.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.920]   I think cup stacking is probably not a skill
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.060]   most of you are interested in doing,
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:15.060]   but for any skill, if you figure out at what rate
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.560]   you are performing repetitions per unit time
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.260]   and you want to increase that slightly,
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.400]   you set a metronome which is slightly faster
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.380]   than your current rate
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.340]   and you just start generating more repetitions.
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.920]   Now what's interesting about this and is cool
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.920]   is it relates back to the experiment from Lapé and colleagues
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.940]   which is your attention is now harnessed to the tone,
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.960]   to the metronome, not necessarily to what you're doing
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.420]   in terms of the motor movement.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.920]   And so really you need a bit of proficiency.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.120]   Again, this is for people who are intermediate
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.080]   or advanced, intermediate or advanced,
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.660]   but what you're essentially doing is
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.140]   you're creating an outside pressure, a contingency
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.700]   so that you generate again, more errors.
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.680]   So it's all about the errors that you get.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.640]   And now these aren't errors where all the cups tumble
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.660]   or you have to stop or you can't keep up.
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:04.440]   You have to set the pace just a little bit
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440]   beyond what you currently can do.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.020]   And when you do that,
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.640]   you're essentially forcing the nervous system
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.720]   to make errors and correct the errors inside of the session.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.040]   I find this really interesting
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.760]   because what it means is again,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.120]   you've got sensory perception,
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.040]   what you're paying attention to,
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.660]   proprioception, where your limbs are
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.880]   and the motor neurons in your upper, lower motor neurons
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.840]   and central pattern generators.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.320]   And you can't pay attention to it.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.820]   Well, they're my upper motor neurons,
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:28.760]   they're my lower motor neurons.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.520]   Forget that, you're not going to do that.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:33.840]   You can't pay attention to your proprioception too much.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.520]   That would be the super slow motion
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.480]   would be the proprioception,
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.200]   but you have to harness your attention to something.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.480]   And if you harness your attention
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.900]   to this outside contingency,
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.760]   this metronome that's firing off and saying,
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.560]   now, go, now, go, now, go.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.020]   Not only can you increase the number of repetitions,
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.600]   errors and successes, but for some reason,
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.360]   and we don't know why, the regular cadence of the tone
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.000]   of the metronome and the fact that you are anchoring
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.540]   your movements to some external force,
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.560]   to some external pressure or cue,
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:11.240]   seems to accelerate the plasticity and the changes
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.800]   and the acquisition of skills beyond what it would be
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.860]   if you just did the same number of repetitions
[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.700]   without that outside pressure.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.400]   We don't know exactly what the mechanism is.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.540]   Presumably it's neurochemical.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.160]   Like there's something about keeping up with a timer
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.120]   or with a pace that presumably, and I'm speculating here,
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.420]   causes the release of particular chemicals.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.880]   But I think it's really cool.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.180]   Metronomes, they're totally inexpensive.
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:36.420]   At least the ones that you use outside of water
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.440]   are very inexpensive.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.180]   You can find these free apps.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.800]   You can use a musical metronome.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.880]   So metronomes are a powerful tool as well.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.600]   In particular for speed work.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.960]   So for sprinting or swimming or running
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.040]   where the goal is to generate more strokes
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.800]   or more efficient strokes or more steps, et cetera,
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.400]   the rate of the metronome obviously
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.280]   is going to be very important.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.900]   Sometimes you're trying to lengthen your stride.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.880]   Sometimes you're trying to take fewer strokes
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.440]   but glide further in the pool, for instance.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.680]   But the value of occasionally
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.880]   just increasing the number of repetitions,
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.800]   the number of strokes or steps, et cetera, per unit time
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.220]   is also that you're training the central pattern generators
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:18.560]   to operate at that higher speed.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.240]   One of the sports that's kind of interesting to me
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.360]   is speed walking.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.560]   It's not one I engage in or ever plan to engage in.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.660]   But if you've ever tried to really speed walk,
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.120]   it's actually difficult to walk very, very fast
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.720]   without breaking into a run.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.160]   All animals have these kind of crossover points
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.040]   where you go, you know, I think with horses,
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.680]   it's like, what is it, they trot, then they gallop.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.520]   I don't know, what's the next thing?
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.480]   I don't know, clearly.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.200]   I don't know anything about horses
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.720]   except that they're beautiful and I like them very much.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.960]   But they break into a different kind of stride.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.240]   And that's because you shift over
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.040]   to different central pattern generators.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.920]   So when you're walking or a horse is moving very slowly
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.200]   and then it breaks into a jog and then into a full sprint
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.760]   or I got to get a gallop for the horse,
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.600]   you're actually engaging
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.320]   different central pattern generators.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.080]   And those central pattern generators
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.820]   always have a range of speeds
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:12.020]   that they're happiest to function at.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.500]   So with the metronoming for speed purposes,
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:19.000]   what you do is you can basically bring the activity
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.860]   of those central pattern generators into their upper range
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:23.980]   and maybe even extend their range.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.680]   And there's a fascinating biology
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.120]   of how central pattern generators work together.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.840]   There's coupling of central pattern generators, et cetera,
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.620]   in order to achieve maximal speeds and et cetera.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.720]   It's a topic for kind of an advanced session.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.160]   Costello loves this topic.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.520]   He just barked and he loves it so much he barked again.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.020]   In any event, the metronome is a powerful tool,
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.160]   again, for more advanced practitioners
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.320]   or for advanced intermediate practitioners.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   But it's interesting because it brings back the point
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.240]   that what we put our attention to
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:57.120]   while we're skill learning is important
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:59.420]   to the extent that it's on one thing,
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:02.060]   at least for the moment or trial to trial,
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:07.060]   but that what we focus our attention on can be external,
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:10.380]   it can be internal, and ultimately the skill learning
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:12.600]   is where all that is brought together.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.080]   So let's talk about where skill learning occurs
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   in the nervous system.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.260]   And then I'm going to give you a really,
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:22.480]   what I think is a really cool tool
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.120]   that can increase flexibility and range of motion
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.840]   based on this particular brain area.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.080]   It's a tool that I used and when I first heard about,
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.080]   I did not believe would work.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:32.960]   This is not a hack.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.400]   This is actually anchored deeply in the biology
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.640]   of a particular brain region that we all have
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.860]   whose meaning is mini brain.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:43.400]   And that mini brain that we all have
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.280]   is called your cerebellum.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.040]   The cerebellum is called the mini brain
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.360]   because it's in the back of your brain.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.520]   It looks like a little mini version
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.920]   of the rest of your brain.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.480]   It's an absolutely incredible structure
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.920]   that's involved in movement.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.300]   It also has a lot of non-movement associated functions.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:04.880]   In brief, the cerebellum gets input from your senses,
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.560]   particularly your eyes and pays attention
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.400]   to where your eyes are in space, what you're looking at.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.240]   It basically takes information about three aspects
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.760]   of your eyes and eye movements,
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:23.280]   which are occurring when your head goes like this,
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.880]   which is called pitch, okay?
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.400]   So this is pitch.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.380]   For those of you listening, I'm just nodding up and down.
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.100]   Then there's yaw, which is like shaking your head no
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.040]   from side to side.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.520]   And then there's roll, which is like sometimes
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.620]   if you see a primate, like a marmoset or something,
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:42.680]   they will roll their head when they look at you.
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.080]   Actually, the reason they do that
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.940]   is it helps generate depth perception.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:47.740]   It's a kind of form of motion parallax
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.080]   if you're curious why they do that.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.560]   It's not to look cute.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.440]   They do it because when they do that,
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.500]   even if you're stationary and they're stationary,
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.220]   they get better depth perception
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.860]   as to how far away from them you are.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.120]   So you've got pitch, yaw, and roll.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.520]   And as you move your head and as you move your body
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.080]   and you move through space,
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:11.220]   the image on your retina moves, pitch, yaw, and roll
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.160]   in some combination.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.460]   That information is relayed to your cerebellum.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.780]   So it's rich with visual information.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.780]   There's also a map of your body surface
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:22.660]   and your movements and timing in the cerebellum.
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:23.820]   So it's an incredible structure
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.000]   that brings together timing of movements,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.660]   which limbs are moving, and has proprioceptive information.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.000]   It really is a mini brain.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.780]   It's just the coolest little structure back there.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.400]   And in humans, actually not that little.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.740]   It's just an incredible structure.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.840]   Now, all this information is integrated there,
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.740]   but what most people don't tell us
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:47.920]   is that a lot of learning of motor sequences,
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.660]   of skill learning that involve timing
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.220]   occurs in the cerebellum.
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:55.100]   Now, you can't really use that information
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.600]   except to know that after you learn something pretty well,
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.780]   it's handed off or kind of handled by your cerebellum.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.660]   But there is something that you can do with your cerebellum
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.700]   to increase range of motion and flexibility.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.800]   Much of our flexibility, believe it or not,
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.440]   is not because our tendons are a particular length
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:16.500]   or elasticity, although that plays some role.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.560]   It's not because our muscles are short.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.980]   I don't know what that would even mean.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.120]   Some people have longer muscle bellies
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.180]   or shorter muscle bellies,
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:26.780]   but your muscles always essentially span
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:30.620]   the entire length of the bone or limb or close to it
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.480]   along with your tendons.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.880]   But it has to do with the neural innervation of muscle
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.200]   and the fact that when muscles are elongated,
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.080]   there's a point at which they won't stretch out any longer
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.860]   and the nerves fire and they shut down.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.660]   You actually have inhibitory pathways
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.480]   that prevent you from contracting the muscles
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.960]   or from extending them, from stretching them out anymore.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.500]   So you can do this right now.
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.980]   If you're driving, don't do it
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.540]   because unless you have a self-driving car,
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.160]   you'll need to take your hands off the steering wheel.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.580]   But because of the way that vision
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.580]   and your muscles are represented in your cerebellum,
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:17.380]   it turns out that your range of visual motion
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.180]   and your range of vision,
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.760]   literally how wide a field of view you take
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.460]   impacts how far you can extend your limbs.
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.740]   So we'll talk about this in a second
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.580]   about exactly how to do this and explore this.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.780]   But as you move through space,
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.860]   as you walk forward or you walk backward
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:40.680]   or you tilt your head or you learn a skill
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.320]   or you just operate in the normal ways throughout your day,
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.240]   driving, biking, et cetera,
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.320]   your eyes are generating spontaneous movements
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.520]   to offset visual slip.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.700]   In other words, you don't see the world as blurry
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.020]   even though you're moving
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.300]   because your eyes are generating
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:57.100]   little compensatory eye movements to offset your motion.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.380]   So if I spin, we could do this experiment.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.220]   There's a fun experiment we do with medical students
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:04.540]   where you spin them around in a chair
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:05.620]   with their eyes closed,
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:08.400]   and then you stop and you have them open their eyes
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.500]   and their eyes are going like this,
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.380]   doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, nice stagmas.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.740]   I don't suggest you do this experiment.
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:16.060]   When we were kids, we did a different experiment
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:17.800]   which was to take a stick
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.260]   and to look at the top of the stick
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.360]   and to spin around on the lawn,
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.420]   looking at the top of the stick,
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.340]   then put it down on the ground and try and jump over it.
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:25.700]   And you end up like jumping to the side,
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.420]   you miss the thing entirely.
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:30.960]   The reason those two quote unquote experiments,
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.660]   which I hope you don't do or for somebody else to do,
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:38.400]   the reason they work is because normally your eye movements
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.000]   and your balance and your limb movements are coordinated.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.600]   But when you spin around looking up at the stick,
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.300]   what you're doing is you're fixating your eyes
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.460]   on one location while you're moving.
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.980]   And then when you stop,
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:50.900]   those two mechanisms are completely uncoupled
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:55.020]   and it's like being thrown into outer space.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:57.760]   Never been to outer space, but probably something like that,
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.060]   low gravity, zero gravity.
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:02.820]   If you spin around in your chair with your eyes closed,
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:05.040]   you're not giving the visual input that you're spinning
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.660]   and then you open the eyes
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:09.180]   and then the eyes only have the,
[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.340]   what we call the vestibular signal,
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.020]   our eyes jolting back and forth, back and forth.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:13.940]   Again, these aren't experiments you need to do
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:16.020]   'cause I just told you the result.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:19.940]   However, if you want to extend your range of motion,
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.620]   you can do that by, these things always look goofy,
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.660]   but at this point I'm just kind of used
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.600]   to doing these things.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.420]   If I want to extend my range of movement,
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:31.000]   first I want to measure my range of motion.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.620]   So I'm trying to, if you're listening,
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:34.500]   what I'm doing is I'm stretching out my arms
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.520]   from like a T from on either side,
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.300]   and I'm trying to push them as far back as I can,
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:43.040]   which for me is, feels like it's in line with my shoulders
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.000]   and I can't get much further.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.780]   I'm not really super flexible,
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:50.780]   nor am I particularly inflexible, at least physically.
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:54.360]   So what I would then do is stop,
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.420]   I would move my eyes to the far periphery, right?
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.500]   So I'm moving my eyes all the way to the left
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.080]   while keeping my head and body stationary.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.760]   I'm trying to look over my left shoulder as far as I can,
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.900]   then off to the right.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:11.420]   It's a little awkward to do this, then up, then down,
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   but I'm mostly going to just focus on left and then right.
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.500]   Now, what that's doing is it's sending a signal
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.920]   to my cerebellum that my field of view is way over to there
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.260]   and way over to there.
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.740]   Remember, your visual attention has an aperture.
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.780]   It can be narrow or it can be broad.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.060]   And I've talked about some of the benefits
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.640]   of taking a broad visual aperture
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.400]   in order to relax the nervous system.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.660]   This is just moving my eyes, not my head,
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.840]   like I just did for a second, from side to side.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.140]   Now I can retest, and actually,
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.180]   you get about a five to 15 degree increase
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.620]   in your range of motion.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:45.460]   Now I'm doing this for you.
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:47.260]   You can say, well, you know, he gamed it
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:49.540]   'cause he knew the result that he was hoping for,
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.100]   but you can try this, okay?
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.660]   And you can do this for legs too, right?
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.420]   You can do this for any limb, essentially,
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.380]   and it's purely cerebellar.
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:01.260]   And it's because the proprioceptive visual
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:04.740]   and limb movement feedback converge
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:08.340]   in the ways that we control our muscle spindles
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.700]   and the way we control the muscle fibers and the tendons,
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.760]   and essentially, you can get bigger range of motion.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.140]   So I actually will warm up before exercise
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.220]   or before skill learning by both doing movements for my body,
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.260]   but also moving my eyes from side to side
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:22.420]   in order to generate larger range of motion,
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:24.820]   if range of motion is something that I'm interested in.
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:28.220]   So that's a fun one that you can play with a little bit,
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:29.780]   and it's purely cerebellar.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:33.060]   Some other time, we'll get back into cerebellar function.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.480]   There's all sorts of just incredible stuff
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.940]   that you can do with cerebellum.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.900]   I talked in an earlier episode on neuroplasticity
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:44.140]   about how you can disrupt your vestibular world,
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:49.140]   in other words, by getting into modes of acceleration,
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:52.460]   moving through space where you're tilted in certain ways,
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.940]   it can open up the windows for plasticity
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.280]   in yet other ways.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.980]   So you can check that out.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.220]   It's one of the earlier episodes on neuroplasticity.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:01.540]   Everything's timestamped.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.340]   But meanwhile, if you want to expand your range of motion
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.660]   before doing skill learning or afterward,
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.500]   this is a fun one.
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.880]   It's also kind of neat
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.220]   because I have this kind of aversion to stretching work.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.140]   It never seems like something I want to do,
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:15.700]   and so I always put it off.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.920]   So if I start with the visual practice
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.500]   of expanding my field of view off to one side
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.120]   or the other side or up or down,
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.380]   then what I find is I'm naturally more flexible.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.720]   I'm not naturally more flexible.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:29.540]   What's happened is I've expanded my range of motion.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:33.220]   Let's talk about visualization and mental rehearsal.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.640]   I've been asked about this a lot,
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.140]   and I think it relates back to that kind of matrix
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:43.100]   Hollywood idea that we can just be embedded with a skill.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.260]   Although in this case, in fairness,
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.660]   visualization involves some work.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:50.260]   And I've talked about this on an earlier episode
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:52.980]   that some people find it very hard
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:56.100]   to mentally visualize things.
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.740]   And some people find it very easy.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:00.620]   There was great work that was done in the 1960s
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:04.920]   by Roger Shepard at Stanford and by others,
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.660]   looking at people's ability
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:10.280]   to rotate three-dimensional objects in their mind.
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.580]   And some people are really good at this,
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:12.960]   and some people are less good at this,
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.300]   and one can get better at it by repeating it.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.940]   But the question we're going to deal with today is,
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:19.940]   does it help?
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.500]   Does it let you learn things faster?
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:26.740]   And indeed the answer appears to be yes, it can.
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:31.400]   However, despite what you've heard, it is not as good.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.780]   It is not a total replacement
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:36.540]   for physical performance itself.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.860]   Okay, so I'm going to be really concrete about this.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:44.860]   I hear all the time that just imagining contracting a muscle
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.440]   can lead to the same gains
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.460]   as actually contracting that muscle.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.860]   Just imagining a skill can lead to the same increases
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:55.340]   in performance as actually executing that skill.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:57.740]   And that's simply not the case.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:02.320]   However, it can supplement or support physical training
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:05.340]   and skill learning in ways that are quite powerful.
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.400]   One of the more interesting studies on this
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.940]   was from Ranganathan et al.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:12.840]   Forgive me for the pronunciation.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:17.140]   This was a slightly older paper, 2004,
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.260]   but nonetheless was one that I thought
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:21.220]   had particularly impressive results
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:25.420]   and included all the appropriate controls, et cetera.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.980]   And what they did is they looked at 30 subjects
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:30.420]   and they divided them into different groups.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:34.440]   They had one group perform essentially finger flexion.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.100]   So it was actually just sort of the imagine
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.080]   if you're just listening to this,
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.260]   the come here finger movement.
[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:42.840]   They also had elbow flexion.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.980]   So it was our bicep curl type movement.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:48.140]   And they either had subjects do
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:51.180]   a actual physical movement against resistance
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.660]   or to imagine moving their finger
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:55.980]   or their wrist towards the shoulder,
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.960]   meaning at the bending at the elbow,
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.760]   towards actual resistance.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.280]   Just to make a long story short,
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:06.940]   what they found was that there were increases
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.240]   in this finger adduction strength,
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.880]   abduction, excuse me, strength of about 35%
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:17.880]   and the elbow flexion strength by about 13.5%,
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.580]   which are pretty impressive
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:22.300]   considering that it was just done mentally.
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:25.660]   So they had people imagine moving against a weight,
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:26.600]   a very heavy weight,
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:30.460]   or had imagined people moving their wrist
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:33.480]   towards their shoulder against a very heavy weight.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.740]   But again, they weren't doing it.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.540]   They were just imagining it.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.460]   Other experiments looked at the brain
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.980]   and what was happening in the brain during this time.
[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:44.060]   So we'll talk about that in a moment.
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:47.840]   But essentially what they found were improvements
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:52.840]   in strength of anywhere from 13.5 to 35%.
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.500]   However, the actual physical training group,
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.040]   the groups that actually moved their wrist
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:02.540]   or moved their finger against an actual physical weight
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:05.280]   had improvements of about 53%.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.980]   So this repeats over and over throughout the literature.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:13.120]   Mental rehearsal can cause increases in strength.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.120]   It can create increases in skill acquisition and learning,
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.380]   but they are never as great if done alone
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:26.900]   as compared to the actual physical execution
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.260]   of those movements or the physical movement of those weights,
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.120]   which shouldn't come as so surprising.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.180]   However, if we step back and we say,
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:37.640]   well, what is the source of this improvement?
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.280]   You might not care what the source is
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.740]   because I could tell you it's one brain area
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.640]   or another brain area, what difference would it make?
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.420]   But again, if you can understand mechanism a little bit,
[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:47.920]   you're in a position to create newer
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.920]   and even better protocols.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.820]   What mental rehearsal appears to do
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.760]   is engage the activity of those upper motor neurons
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.860]   that we talked about way back
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:58.760]   at the beginning of the episode.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.220]   Remember, you have upper motor neurons
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.860]   that control deliberate action.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:03.180]   You've got lower motor neurons
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.420]   that actually connect to the muscles and move those muscles,
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.300]   and you have central pattern generators.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:10.140]   Mental rehearsal, closing one's eyes typically,
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.220]   and thinking about a particular sequence of movement
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:18.220]   and visualizing it in one's quote unquote mind's eye
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:21.340]   creates activation of the upper motor neurons
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:25.740]   that's very similar if not the same as the actual movement.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.000]   And that makes sense because the upper motor neurons
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.280]   are all about the command for movement.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:33.200]   They are not the ones that actually execute the movement.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.120]   Okay?
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.540]   Remember, upper motor neurons
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:37.580]   are the ones that generate the command for movement,
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:38.960]   not the actual movement.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.560]   The ones that generate the actual movement
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.800]   are the lower motor neurons
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.920]   and the central pattern generators.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.520]   So visualization is a powerful tool.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.640]   How can you use visualization?
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.700]   Well, in this study,
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:54.700]   they had people perform this five days a week.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.460]   I believe that it was 15.
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.580]   Yes, it was 15 minutes per day,
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:01.660]   five days a week for 12 weeks.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.180]   So that's a lot of mental rehearsal.
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.540]   It's not a ton of time each day, 15 minutes per day,
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.260]   but sitting down, closing your eyes,
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:13.100]   and imagining going through a particular skill practice
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.760]   or moving a weight.
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:18.220]   Maybe it's playing keys on a piano,
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.500]   if that's your thing, or strings on a guitar.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:24.700]   For 15 minutes a day, five days per week for 12 weeks
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.580]   is considerable.
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.300]   I think most people,
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.700]   given the fact that the actual practice,
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.420]   the physical practice is going to lead
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:35.380]   to larger improvements, greater improvements
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:37.300]   than would the mental training,
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.000]   would opt for the actual physical training.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.800]   But of course, if you're on a plane
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.460]   and you don't have access to your guitar
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.700]   and you're certainly not going to be sprinting
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:45.980]   up and down the aisle,
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:48.980]   or you are very serious about your craft
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:52.300]   and you want to accelerate performance of your craft
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.720]   or strength increases or something of that sort,
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:58.660]   then augmenting or adding in the visualization training
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:01.460]   very likely will compound the effects
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.320]   of the actual physical training.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.460]   There are not a lot of studies looking at how visualization
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:10.300]   on top of pure physical training
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:13.540]   can increase the rates of learning
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:16.180]   and consolidation of learning, et cetera.
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.620]   It's actually a hard study to do
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.860]   because it's hard to control for
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:20.780]   because what would you do in its place?
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.480]   You would probably add actual physical training
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.500]   and then that's always going to lead to greater effects.
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.820]   So the point is,
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:31.080]   if you want to use visualization training, great,
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:34.540]   but forget the idea that visualization training
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.740]   is as good as the actual behavior.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:38.700]   You hear this all the time.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.260]   People say, do you know that if you imagine an experience
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:42.720]   to your brain and to your body,
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.060]   it's exactly the same as the actual experience?
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:46.080]   Absolutely not.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.660]   This is not the way the nervous system works.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.720]   I'm sorry, I don't mean to burst anybody's bubble,
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:52.420]   but your bubble is made of myths.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:56.380]   And the fact of the matter is that the brain,
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.540]   when it executes movement,
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:01.100]   is generating proprioceptive feedback
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.420]   and that proprioceptive feedback is critically involved
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:06.740]   in generating our sense of the experience
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.620]   and in things like learning.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:12.780]   So I don't say this because I don't like the idea
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.220]   that visualization couldn't work.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:16.100]   In fact, visualization does work,
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.980]   but it doesn't work as well.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.580]   It doesn't create the same milieu,
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:23.320]   the same chemical milieu, the same environment
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.300]   as actual physically engaging in the behavior,
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.740]   the skill, the resistance training, et cetera.
[01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:32.480]   And I'd be willing to wager that the same is true
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.820]   for experiences of all kinds.
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:40.020]   PTSD is this incredibly unfortunate circumstance
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:43.620]   in which there's a replay often of the traumatic event
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:45.480]   that feels very real,
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.620]   but that's not to say that the replay itself
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:49.980]   is the same as the actual event.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:52.040]   And of course, PTSD needs to be dealt with
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.420]   with the utmost level of seriousness.
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:57.000]   It should be treated.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.160]   In fact, my lab works on these sorts of things,
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.560]   but my point about visualization and imagining something
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.340]   not being the same as the actual experience
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.940]   is grounded in this idea of proprioception
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.040]   and the fact that feedback to the cerebellum,
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.780]   the cerebellum talking to other areas of the brain
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:14.940]   are critically involved in communicating
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.380]   to the rest of our nervous system,
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:18.840]   that not just that we believe something is happening,
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.500]   but something is actually happening.
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.280]   And in the case of muscle loads,
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.980]   muscles actually feeling tension,
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:28.460]   the actual feeling of tension in the muscle,
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.900]   the contracting of the muscle under that tension
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:34.380]   is part of the important adaptation process.
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:36.460]   In a future episode, we'll talk about hypertrophy
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:38.600]   and how that works at the level of upper motor neurons,
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.980]   lower motor neurons, and muscle itself.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.060]   But for now, just know that visualization can work.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.060]   It doesn't work as well as real physical training
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:51.060]   in practice, but these effects of 35% or 13.5% increases
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.980]   are pretty considerable.
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.940]   They're just not as great as the 53% increases
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.900]   that come from actual physical training.
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.460]   For those of you that are interested
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:02.380]   in some of the skill learning
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:04.420]   that more relates to musical training,
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:08.780]   but also how cadence and metronoming and tones, et cetera,
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.560]   can support physical learning.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.680]   If you're interested in that, you aficionados,
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.660]   there is a wonderful review
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:19.160]   also published in the journal Neuron,
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.480]   again, excellent journal, by Herholz and Zatorre.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:27.480]   That's H-E-R-H-O-L-Z and Zatorre, Z-A-T-O-R-R-E,
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:34.880]   that really describes in detail how musical training
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.600]   can impact all sorts of different things
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.580]   and how cadence training, whether or not with tones
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:44.480]   or auditory feedback and things of that sort,
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:48.700]   carries over to not just instrumental music training,
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:51.420]   but also physical skill learning of various kinds.
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:52.780]   So if you wanted to do the deep dive,
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:53.740]   that would be the place.
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.020]   You can find it easily online.
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.620]   It's available as a complete article free of charge,
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:58.740]   et cetera.
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.620]   Many of you are probably asking,
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:03.860]   what can I take in order to accelerate skill learning?
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:06.180]   Well, the conditions are going to vary,
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.760]   but motivation is key.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.480]   You have to show up to the training session
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.380]   motivated enough to focus your attention
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:17.180]   and to perform a lot of repetitions in the training sequence.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:19.220]   That's just a prerequisite, all right?
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.460]   There's no pill that's going to allow you
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.280]   to do fewer repetitions and extract more learning
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.440]   out of fewer repetitions.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.340]   It's actually more a question of what are the conditions
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:28.880]   that you can create for yourself
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.580]   such that you can generate more repetitions per unit time?
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.200]   I think that's the right way to think about it.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.980]   What are the conditions that you can create for yourself
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:38.140]   in your mind and in your body
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:40.560]   that are going to allow you to focus?
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.600]   And I've talked about focus and plasticity and motivation
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.580]   in previous episodes.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.340]   Please see those episodes if you have questions about that.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:50.200]   I detail a lot of tools and the underlying science.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.380]   So for some people, it might be drinking a cup or two
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:54.880]   of coffee and getting hydrated before the training session.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.780]   For some of you, it might be avoiding coffee
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:57.880]   because it makes you too jittery
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.580]   and your attention jumps all over the place.
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:01.160]   It's going to vary tremendously.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.540]   There's no real, there is no magic pill
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:06.220]   that's going to allow you to get more out of less.
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:07.680]   That's just not going to happen.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:09.100]   It's simply not going to happen.
[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:10.540]   You're not going to get more learning
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:12.940]   out of fewer repetitions or less time.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.840]   However, there are a few compounds
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.940]   that I think are worth mentioning
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:20.860]   because of their ability to improve
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:22.620]   the actual physical performance,
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:25.580]   the actual execution of certain types of movements.
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:27.660]   And some of these have also been shown
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:29.620]   to improve cognitive function,
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.480]   especially in older populations.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.020]   So I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention them.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:36.600]   I'm only going to mention one today in fact.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.260]   The one that's particularly interesting
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:42.380]   and for which there really are a lot of data is alpha-GPC.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:45.800]   And I'm going to attempt to pronounce
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.380]   what alpha-GPC actually is.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:50.800]   It's alpha-glycerophosphocoline, right?
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.940]   Alpha-GPC, alpha-glycerophosphocoline.
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:55.820]   See, if I keep doing it over and over repetitions,
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:57.800]   alpha-glycerophosphocoline.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:58.740]   There, I made an error.
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:02.440]   Okay, so the point is that alpha-GPC,
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.060]   which is at least in the United States
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:05.420]   is sold over the counter,
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:10.420]   typically is taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:13.960]   That's a single dose or have been shown
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.200]   to do a number of things
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.000]   that for some of you might be beneficial.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.800]   One is to enhance power output.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.440]   So if you're engaging in something like shot put throwing
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:25.420]   or resistance training or sprinting
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:28.060]   or something where you have to generate a lot of power,
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.460]   maybe you're doing rock climbing,
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:31.700]   but you're working on a particular aspect
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:32.540]   of your rock climbing
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:36.160]   that involves generating a lot of force, a lot of power.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.640]   Well, then in theory, alpha-GPC could be beneficial to you.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.260]   For the cognitive effects, the dosages are much higher,
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:47.960]   up to 1200 milligrams daily divided into three doses
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.680]   of 400 milligrams is what the studies
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.140]   that I was able to find show or used.
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:56.520]   The effects on cognitive decline are described as notable.
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:59.540]   Notable meaning several studies showed a significant
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:03.600]   but modest effect in offsetting cognitive decline,
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.440]   in particular in older populations and some populations
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.280]   even with some reported neurodegeneration.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:13.680]   Power output was notable.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:15.800]   How notable, what does that mean notable?
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:20.700]   A study noted a 14% increase in power output.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:25.480]   That's pretty substantial, 14% if you think about it,
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.960]   but it wasn't like a doubling or something of that sort.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.840]   Believe it or not, the symptoms of Alzheimer's
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:33.600]   have been shown at least among the nutraceuticals
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.160]   of which alpha-GPC is to significantly improve cognition
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.020]   in people with Alzheimer's.
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:39.980]   Now, this episode isn't about cognitive decline
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:41.960]   and longevity, we will talk about that,
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.960]   but this is a so-called another effect of alpha-GPC.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.040]   Fat oxidation is increased by alpha-GPC,
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.960]   growth hormone release is promoted by alpha-GPC,
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.060]   although to a small degree.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:01.880]   So as you can see, things like alpha-GPC in particular,
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.560]   when they are combined with low levels of caffeine
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:07.200]   can have these effects of improving power output,
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.260]   can improve growth hormone release,
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.720]   can improve fat oxidation.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.840]   All these things in theory can support skill learning,
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:17.040]   but what they're really doing is they're adjusting
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.780]   the foundation upon which you are going to execute
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:22.000]   these many, many repetitions, okay?
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.600]   The same thing would be said for caffeine itself.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.180]   If that's something that motivates you
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.080]   and gets you out of a chair
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.540]   to actually do the physical training,
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:32.400]   then that's something that can perhaps improve
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.240]   or enhance the rate of skill learning
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:36.800]   and how well you retain those skills.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.200]   Now, on a previous episode, I talked about,
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.860]   and this was the episode on epinephrine, on adrenaline,
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:47.560]   I talked about how for mental, for cognitive learning,
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.840]   it makes sense to spike epinephrine,
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:53.740]   to bump epinephrine levels up,
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.020]   adrenaline levels up after cognitive learning.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.880]   For physical learning, it appears to be the opposite,
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:02.660]   that if caffeine is in your practice
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:05.200]   or if you decide to try alpha-GPC,
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.420]   that you would want to do that before the training,
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:09.500]   take it before the training, use it,
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.600]   its effect should extend into the training,
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.240]   presumably throughout, and then afterward,
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.580]   if you're thinking about following
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.400]   some of the protocols that we discussed today,
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.300]   that you would use some sort of idle time
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:23.560]   where the brain can replay these motor sequences in reverse,
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.700]   and then of course you want to do things
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:26.360]   that optimize your sleep.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.000]   A lot of the questions I get
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.040]   are about how different protocols
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.120]   and things that I described
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.700]   start to collide with one another.
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:35.380]   So let's say, for instance, you go to bed at 1030
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:39.800]   and you're going to do your skill training at 930,
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:42.080]   well, taking a lot of caffeine then
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.020]   is not going to be a good idea
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:44.660]   'cause it's going to compromise your sleep.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.220]   So I'm not here to design the perfect schedule for you
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.420]   because everyone's situations vary.
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:55.420]   So the things to optimize are repetitions, failures,
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:58.740]   more repetitions, more failures,
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:00.300]   at the offset of training,
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.900]   having some idle time that could be straight into sleep,
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:05.460]   or it could be simply letting the brain
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:08.120]   just go idle for five to 10 minutes,
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.340]   I mean, not focusing on anything,
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:12.260]   not scrolling social media, not emailing,
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:13.700]   ideally not even talking to somebody,
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.260]   just lying down or sitting quietly with your eyes closed,
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:18.780]   letting those motor sequences replay.
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.860]   Then we talked about how one can come back
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.740]   for additional training sessions,
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:25.420]   use things like metronoming,
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:29.140]   where you're cuing your attention to some external cue,
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:31.460]   some stimulus, in this case, an auditory stimulus,
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.260]   most likely, and trying to generate
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.740]   more repetitions per unit time.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:37.860]   So again, it's repetitions and errors, that's key.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:40.540]   And then we also talked about some things that you can do
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:42.740]   involving cerebellar neurophysiology
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:45.940]   to extend range of motion if that's what's limiting for you,
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:49.820]   or to use visualization to augment the practice,
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:53.700]   or let's say your particular skill involves nice weather
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.280]   and it's raining or snowing outside
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:57.220]   and you can't get outside, a thunderstorm,
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:45:59.140]   then that's where visualization training
[01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:01.980]   might be a good replacement under those conditions,
[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:04.480]   or in most cases, it's going to be the kind of thing
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:05.420]   that you're going to want to do
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:08.100]   in addition to the actual physical skill
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:10.860]   or strength training session done,
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:12.380]   at least in the study that we described,
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.200]   for 15 minutes a day, five days a week,
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.220]   over a period of 10 to 12 weeks or so.
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:20.780]   So hopefully that makes it clear.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:23.340]   Today, we've covered a lot of mechanism.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:26.260]   We talked so much about the different motor pathways,
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:27.460]   central pattern generators.
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:31.540]   So you now are armed with a lot of information
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:33.360]   about how you generate movement.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:35.720]   And I like to think that you're also armed
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:38.900]   with a lot of information about how to design protocols
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:41.160]   that are optimized for you, or if you're a coach,
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:46.160]   for your trainees in order to optimize their learning
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.380]   of skills of various kinds.
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:53.040]   Today, we focused almost entirely on motor skills,
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.700]   things like musical skills or physical skills.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.020]   These have some overlap.
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:00.340]   They're partially overlapping with neuroplasticity
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:03.540]   for learning things like languages or math or engineering
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.160]   or neuroscience for that matter.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:09.500]   Before we depart, I just want to make sure
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:13.320]   that I return to a concept which is the ultradian cycle.
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.480]   Ultradian cycles are these 90-minute cycles
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.200]   that we go through throughout sleep and wakefulness
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.920]   that are optimal for learning and attention
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.340]   in the waking state.
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:24.780]   They are the stages of sleep
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.060]   in which we have either predominantly
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:27.900]   slow-wave sleep or REM sleep.
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.760]   Some of you who have been following this podcast
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.040]   for a while might be asking,
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.280]   well, should a physical practice be 90 minutes?
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:38.120]   That's going to depend because with physical practices,
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.340]   oftentimes, for instance, with strength training,
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.460]   that might be too long.
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.980]   You're not going to be able to generate enough force output
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:45.440]   for it to be worthwhile.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.400]   For golfing, I don't know, I've never played golf,
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.500]   although my friends that play golf,
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.600]   they disappear under the golf course for many hours.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:53.660]   So I know there's a lot of walking and driving
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:54.660]   and other stuff.
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:57.560]   I even hear that somebody carries your stuff around for you.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:02.280]   Sometimes, not always, but it's going to differ.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.160]   In a four-hour golf game,
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.660]   you're probably not swinging the golf club for four hours.
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:07.560]   So it's going to depend.
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.940]   I would say that the ultradian cycle
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:12.920]   is not necessarily a good constraint
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.480]   for skill learning in most cases.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.220]   And I should say that for those of you
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:20.300]   that are short on time or have limited amounts of time,
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:22.140]   10 minutes of maximum repetitions,
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.020]   maximum focus skill learning work
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:26.760]   is going to be very beneficial.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:29.820]   Whereas two hours of kind of haphazard,
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:32.180]   not really focused work,
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:34.500]   or where you're not generating very many repetitions
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.060]   'cause you're doing it for a few repetitions,
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.360]   and you're texting on your phone
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:38.500]   or paying attention to something else,
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.140]   that's not going to be beneficial.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.300]   It's really about the density of training
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:43.180]   inside of a session.
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:46.520]   So I think you should work toward maximal
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.980]   or near maximal density of repetitions and failures,
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:52.960]   provided they're failures you can perform safely
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.560]   in order to accelerate skill learning.
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.780]   And don't let some arbitrary,
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.520]   or in this case, the ultradian constraint
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.320]   prevent you from engaging in that practice.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.660]   In other words, get the work in,
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:05.180]   get as much work done as you can per unit time.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:06.780]   And based on the science,
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:08.200]   based on things that I've seen,
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:10.260]   based on things that I'm now involved in
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:11.460]   with various communities,
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:16.460]   you will see the skill improve vastly at various stages.
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:18.140]   Sometimes it's a little bit stutter start.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:20.780]   It's not always a linear improvement,
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:23.560]   but you will see incredible improvement in skill.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.000]   If you're enjoying this podcast

[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:10.740]   The sponsors that we mentioned
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.860]   at the beginning of each podcast episode
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:14.420]   are really important in order to support
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:15.820]   our production team.
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:17.940]   And as well, we have a Patreon.
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.700]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:23.580]   There you can support us at any level that you like.
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.660]   In previous episodes and in this episode,
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.300]   I mentioned some supplements.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:31.240]   Supplements certainly have their place for various things.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.240]   They aren't necessary,
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:33.780]   but many people, including myself,
[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:35.620]   derive benefit from supplements
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:38.660]   for things like improving sleep and immune system function
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:40.520]   and learning and so forth.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.740]   If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take,
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:46.100]   you can go to thorn.com/u,
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:48.460]   that's the letter U, /huberman,
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:50.720]   and you can see the supplements that I take.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.280]   If you want to try any of those supplements,
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.660]   you can get 20% off simply by accessing the Thorne webpage
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:57.820]   through that portal,
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:00.300]   as well as 20% off any of the other supplements
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:01.540]   that Thorne makes.
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:03.040]   The reason we've partnered with Thorne
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.880]   is because Thorne has the very highest levels of stringency
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:08.540]   in terms of the quality of the supplements
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:11.640]   and the accuracy about the amounts of each supplement
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:12.480]   that are in the bottle.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.940]   One of the major problems in the supplement industry
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.040]   is that when supplements get tested,
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:21.080]   often it's the case that the amount of a given ingredient
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:23.860]   is far lower or far greater
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:25.300]   than what's reported on the bottle.
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:26.800]   That's not the case for Thorne.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.760]   Thorne has very high levels of stringency.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.280]   They partnered with the Mayo Clinic
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.720]   and all the major sports teams,
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:34.720]   and that's why we've partnered with them as well.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:35.900]   So if you want to check those out,
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:40.900]   again, it's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, /u, /huberman,
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:45.120]   to get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.360]   And last but not least,
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.620]   I want to thank you for your time and attention.
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:51.200]   I very much appreciate your interest in neuroscience
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:54.140]   and in physiology and in tools that are informed
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.160]   by neuroscience and physiology.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.800]   Today, we talked all about skill learning.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.980]   I hope that you'll consider the information.
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.760]   You might even decide to try some of these tools.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.380]   If you do, please let us know your results with them.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:07.080]   Give us feedback in the comments.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.860]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:12.440]   [upbeat music]
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:15.020]   (upbeat music)
