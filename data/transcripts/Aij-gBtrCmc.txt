[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.240]   - Carolyn from Derbyshire, England writes in to ask this,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.920]   Dear Pastor John, how should I handle friends or family
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.800]   visiting overnight who are non-Christians
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.720]   and who are sinfully living together
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.520]   or who are living in same-sex relationships?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.240]   Likewise, Wayne writes in to ask,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.400]   Pastor John, how far should I go to impose my values
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.600]   on non-Christians or even nominal Christians
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.240]   when they stay in my home?
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.120]   For instance, if an unmarried couple wants to share a bed
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.880]   when spending the night in our home,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.960]   should I insist that they not share a bed
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.840]   even at the risk of destroying the relationship?
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.780]   - I don't find this question easy, first of all.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.700]   Some might think it's a no-brainer, but I don't.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.080]   Because I agree that in general,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.360]   we're not responsible for the sins of unbelievers.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.680]   In the church, among believers,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   we seek to admonish each other and encourage each other
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.520]   to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.560]   and we discipline those who are unrepentant
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.480]   in flagrant sin.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.360]   But what about those outside?
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.800]   So here's the key passage.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.560]   One of our elders preached on this a couple Sundays ago.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.400]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 5, 9,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   I wrote to you in my letter
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.440]   not to associate with the sexually immoral people,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.760]   not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world,
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.480]   for what have I to do with judging outsiders?
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.140]   Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.500]   God judges those outside.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.500]   So I feel the concern that Caroline and Wayne express
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   in not wanting to police the bedrooms of unbelievers,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.600]   and not to let such a policing drive people away
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.620]   when you were hoping that a friendship
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.960]   might lead them to Christ.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.900]   But what makes it difficult is that there's another thing
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.840]   we want to avoid besides undermining the relationship.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   Namely, we want to avoid communicating the message
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.320]   that we are indifferent to their sinful behavior.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.160]   Behavior in fact that Paul says will bring them to ruin,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.180]   will bring the wrath of God on them, Colossians 3, 6.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.960]   Add to that the concern
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.840]   that a common cultural expectation in our culture
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.840]   is that guests generally conform to the expectations
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.800]   of the host without feeling controlled or policed.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.920]   And add, here's a third thing that makes it difficult.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.500]   The possible application of Romans 13, 14.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.400]   It says, "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.440]   "and make no provision for the flesh
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.720]   "to gratify its desires."
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   Make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.440]   Now, I know that this applies first and foremost
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.760]   to our own behavior.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   Don't make provision for your own fleshly sin.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.720]   Don't make it easy, don't plan for it,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.960]   don't put anything out there
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.920]   as a base of operations for it.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.360]   But might it not also have implications
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   for our participation in other people's flesh?
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.960]   We're not called to police the private sins of unbelievers,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.720]   but neither are we called to make provision for them
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   in our own home.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   So my answer is a non-absolute encouragement,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.560]   this is what seems to me to be wise,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.240]   given all those factors,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   a non-absolute encouragement to live the kind of life
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.560]   and speak the kind of robust faith upfront,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.880]   upfront, at work, in the relationship, at school,
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.520]   so that people know we are Christians
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.600]   with standards drawn from scriptures.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.320]   It's not a shock if we bring something up.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.600]   And then we seek to delicately and humbly,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.720]   I spoke this, I told Noelle about this question,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.440]   my wife and daughter, and got their input.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.360]   And Noelle is always wise when I bring these up to her.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.520]   And she said, "You know, how you talk about it
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.280]   "is gonna make all the difference."
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.720]   And that's right.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   And so humbly and delicately,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.320]   you say maybe something like this.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.440]   You know, as a Christian,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.160]   I think sleeping together is something
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.760]   that God reserves for marriage.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.080]   I think that's what he taught us in the Bible.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.100]   I know you don't see things that way,
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.100]   and I don't want that to drive a wedge between us,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.440]   but it would make me feel better
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   if in my home, you would stay in different rooms tonight.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.860]   And my daughter added, she said,
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.320]   "Anytime anybody that I go visit
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.180]   "gives up their bedroom for me, I feel honored."
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.360]   'Cause it probably would cost that, right?
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.840]   You don't have that many bedrooms to go around.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.360]   Somebody's sleeping on the couch,
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.160]   and it would be awkward for you
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.360]   to put one of them on the couch,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.320]   because then they're gonna feel like,
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.680]   "Oh, well, they made it difficult."
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.320]   But you give them your bedroom,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.080]   the guest room to one, your room to the other,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.360]   and you go to the couch.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.560]   She thought that would possibly have an impact for good.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.720]   What that simple statement says
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.260]   is a desire for the relationship to continue,
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.960]   sends the signal that you have firm convictions,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.360]   different from the surrounding culture,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.960]   which is what the world really expects
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.800]   from serious Christians.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.680]   It will be far less confusing for them
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.880]   when you talk someday about what it means
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.600]   to follow Jesus.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.740]   It would prove awkward if they said,
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.340]   "Oh, I didn't know you had a problem
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.920]   "with us sleeping together, since we did it at your house."
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.720]   So that's my estimate of the situation.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.320]   Communicate both a desire for the relationship
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   and a firm conviction about sexual abstinence
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.920]   outside marriage.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.760]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.040]   and thank you, Carolyn and Wayne,
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.440]   for the very practical questions.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.880]   Keep them coming in.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.560]   On a related note, see episode number 365
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.840]   in this podcast series where I ask Pastor John,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.200]   will you marry a couple already living together?
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.560]   That's episode number 365.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.080]   Tomorrow we'll be back to talk more about God's will,
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.520]   specifically how God can be sovereign
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.440]   over what he finds to be morally objectionable.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.380]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.540]   (upbeat music)
