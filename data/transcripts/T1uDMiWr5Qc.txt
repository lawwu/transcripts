[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Christmas is Saturday. It's a great time to take a fresh
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   look at Christmas, particularly in what Christ's birth
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   represents in the big picture. As the Apostle Paul says of us,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Christians, we are those "on whom the end of the ages
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   has come." 1 Corinthians 10, 11.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   The end of the ages has come upon us. And the end of the ages
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   has come upon us by the incarnation of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is a big concept. It's a hard one, but it's
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   worth the time. Theologian Richard Gaffin has developed this
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   point really well in a really good book, his magnum opus coming out next year
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   titled "In the Fullness of Time," an introduction
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   to the biblical theology of Acts and Paul. There he writes
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   this of why the Apostle Paul was so amazed that he and us are ones in which
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   the end of the ages has come. Paul, Gaffin
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   writes, "is deeply conscious of living in the fullness of
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   time, when at last God has sent his Son,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and when the new creation has already dawned."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   His vantage point in history is characterized by the fact that he is
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   privileged to be able now to look back on the climactic
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   events of the history of redemption, the birth and
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   death and resurrection of Christ as having occurred.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Using a sometimes cited analogy from the Second World War,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Paul knows himself to be among those for whom the great D-Day
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   kingdom battle is over, for whom the era of
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   conflict between the kingdom of God and the dominion of Satan is in the past
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and has been decisively resolved.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The redemption of God's people is an accomplished and secure
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   reality. Get that? D-Day is
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   done. V-Day is yet future in the Second
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Coming. Nevertheless, D-Day, that decisive battle, is over.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's won. The kingdom has dawned.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   In other words, Gaffin writes, "God's revelation in his Son
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and his incarnate person and work has a finality
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   that cannot be superseded or surpassed."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   That is the significance
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   of the incarnation. The new creation has
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   arrived. The kingdom of God has dawned. The future full arrival
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   of the kingdom and the new creation, V-Day to come, is now inevitable
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and unstoppable because there is a finality to redemptive
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   history at Christmas. Paul never lost his
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   amazement at this, that something climactic, something decisive, something
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   marking the end of time happened in a dusty
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   manger in Bethlehem. To use the
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Apostle Paul's very words, "When the fullness
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   of time had come, God sent
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   to redeem those who were under the law so that we might receive
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   adoption as sons." Galatians 4, verses 4 and 5.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That first Christmas marked the fullness
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   of time. Or to say it another way, history ended
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   on Christmas. As John Piper explains in this clip from
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   his 1981 Christmas sermon preached 40 years ago.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   40 years ago. Here's 35-year-old John Piper.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   The meaning of Christmas was a total
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   blur for some 30 years until
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   the Apostles broke through to the insight that,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   "Oh, this is the first half of
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   the final act of redemption and the second half
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   will only come later." And when they finally saw
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   that, God counted them prepared to interpret
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Christmas for us. And that's what they did in the New Testament.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Interpreting the incarnation in view of
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   the second coming. Now, everything
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   they wrote in their interpretation of the incarnation
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   has a trademark about it. A very unusual
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   trademark that stamps it as apostolic.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   The words of the Apostles. The
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   trademark is that even though
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   the Apostles looked forward to the second
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   appearance of the coming of the Messiah, they nevertheless
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   called the first appearing of the Messiah
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   the end of the ages. History
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   ended at Christmas. That's the trademark of the Apostles.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   They do not treat Christmas
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   as just another bend in the river
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   of redemptive history. With Christmas comes the
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   end. Let me show you some examples of where this trademark
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   is found. In 1 Corinthians 10, 11, the
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Apostle Paul says that all the events of the Old Testament
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   happened to them as a warning, but
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   they were written down for our instruction upon
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   whom the end of the ages has come.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   That's Paul speaking 2,000 years ago. The end
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   of the ages has fallen upon us.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   The Apostle Peter, do you remember what he said when he stood up on
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Pentecost to interpret what was happening in the fall
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   of the Holy Spirit? He said, quoting Joel,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   "This is what was spoken by the prophet Joel. In the
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   last days it shall be, God declares, that I will
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   pour out my spirit." Those were the last days.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Again, the Apostle Peter in his first letter
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   wrote in the text that was read earlier in chapter 1, verse 20,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that Christ was destined before the foundation of the world
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   but was made manifest at the end
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   of the times for our sake. Manifest
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   at the end of the times. The appearing of Jesus at Christmas
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   marked the end of the times, or as Paul called it,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   the end of the ages. One other text
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   from Hebrews 9, 26, which is especially
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   important because here the two comings of the Messiah are held side by
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   side, and still the first one is called
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   the end. Hebrews 9, 26, "Christ has appeared
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   once for all at the end of the age
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, and
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   just as it is appointed unto men once to die and after that the judgment, so
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Christ, having been offered once to bear
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   the sins of many, will appear a second time
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   not to deal with sin but to save those
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   who are eagerly waiting for him." Now,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   what this text shows is that even though time had elapsed
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   between Christmas and the writing of Hebrews, and he
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   looked forward to another uncertain elapse of time
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   till that second appearing, nevertheless he still looked back
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and said that first coming was the end
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   of the age. That's the trademark of the Apostles.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   That's the way they thought about Christmas, and I think the
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Holy Spirit preserves that trademark for us because
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   there is a tremendously important truth in it, namely,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   don't trivialize Christmas
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   into just another great event in the stream of
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   redemptive history. Creation out of nothing was an
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   awesome event. I try to imagine what the angels
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   thought when matter, the universe,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   flashed into existence at the Word of God.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Never had imagined such a thing, and there it was.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   The fall was an awful event
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   that shook creation. The exodus was an amazing
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   display of power and love. The giving of the law, the wandering
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   in the wilderness, the conquest of Canaan, the rise of the monarchy, the prophetic
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   word, great demonstrations of the power of God
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   along the river of redemptive history. But
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   don't align Christmas on the same
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   continuum with those great events.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   We trivialize the incarnation if we make it
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   just another stage along the way
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   to the end. It is the end of
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   redemptive history, and I think the analogy of the river
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   helps us see how. Picture this for me.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   If you're familiar with the Mississippi River all the way to the Gulf,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   put the Mississippi in your mind. If you want to use another river, do that.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Picture redemptive history now flowing from creation right
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   on through as a river, and picture the
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   ocean into which it is flowing as the final
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   kingdom of God, eternal, glorious beyond all
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   description. At the mouth of this river, at the
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   end of the river, the ocean presses back
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   with its salt water a ways up into
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   the river. I've always wondered what kind of fish live in this
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   no man's land where the freshwater and the salt water
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   are mingling where the river meets the ocean.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Therefore, at the mouth of the river, there's a mingling
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   of freshwater and saltwater, and one might say
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   that the kingdom has has pressed its way back
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   up into the stream of history a
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   short way. It has surprised the travelers
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   on that river very, very much. They can taste it
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   if they put their dipper down into the water, they can
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   smell it. They can see the seagulls circling
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   the deck. The end has come upon them, even though
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   they're still on the river. Christmas
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   is not just another bend in that river. Christmas is
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   the arrival of the salt water of the
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   kingdom back up into the river for a
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   ways and that salt water is
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   beckoning us, welcoming us, alluring us on out into
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   the deep. Christmas is not just another
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   great bend in the river. It is the end
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   of the river. Let down your dipper. Taste Jesus Christ.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Taste his birth, his life, his death, his resurrection has
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   not the age to come fallen upon us has not
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   the kingdom arrived. Do you not taste the powers
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   of the age to come? I think those who can
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   taste it, lift up their eyes and they see a big
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   blue bow on the horizon
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   between sky and ocean
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   and they are hankering and longing
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   to go on out of the delta and the mouth of the river
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   into the ocean. Amazing. That's a huge perspective
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   of Christmas in light of history, the end of history.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   That clip was taken from John Piper's sermon on December 20th, 1981 titled
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Christmas as the end of history 40 years ago.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Piper was just 35 years old. This clip is older than Piper was
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   when he preached it. That's funny. Well, 40 years later that preacher is
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   75 years old now and I'm going to ask Pastor John about what makes Christmas
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   precious to him all these decades later. I'll ask him that
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   on Christmas Eve when we return on Friday. I'm your host Tony Rehnke
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and we will see you back here next time for that. Thanks for listening.
