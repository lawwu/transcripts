[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   A male chimp is more than enough to kill any human
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.320]   on the planet, including Gordon Ryan.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.280]   - So Gordon Ryan fighting a chimp, a good size--
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.120]   - Did.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360]   - No, a thousand times, how many times does he win?
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.680]   - He loses a thousand times.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.800]   It's not even competitive.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.880]   It's not even remotely competitive.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.960]   - Do you think he will disagree?
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.240]   - No.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.080]   - Okay.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.560]   Do you think anyone will disagree?
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.400]   Anyone?
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.360]   - Yeah, morons.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.600]   (laughing)
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.360]   - The following is a conversation with Jon Donaher,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.520]   his third time on this podcast.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.960]   He's widely considered to be one of the greatest minds
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.040]   in martial arts history.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.360]   This is a Lex Friedman podcast.

[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.680]   in the description.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.600]   And now, dear friends, here's Jon Donaher.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.040]   The ADCC is the premier submission grappling tournament
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   in the world.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.880]   We just had it a couple of weeks ago.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.320]   We saw many demonstrations of greatness
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.000]   from athletes you coached.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.440]   But a year ago, the team and you were at a very low point.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.680]   Take me through that journey.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.360]   What was the lowest point?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.640]   - We had a very, very tight team for many years,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.480]   which began in New York City.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.440]   During the peak of COVID, training in New York
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.240]   became very difficult to sustain.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.240]   So most of the team despised the city of New York.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.640]   I was the only person in the group
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.040]   that liked living in New York.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040]   I think part of the problem was that I was the only one
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.640]   who actually lived in Manhattan.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.880]   The others had to commute to New York.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600]   And there's a world of difference between living in New York
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.440]   and commuting to New York.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.200]   So most of them had a very negative view of New York City.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.800]   That was compounded by COVID,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.960]   when even the basic act of training
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.160]   became very, very difficult.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.480]   And so everyone decided they want to leave.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.320]   So there was a prospect of a complete breakup
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.920]   between myself and the team,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.800]   or I would have to leave New York.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.320]   It was a difficult decision for me to make,
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.200]   'cause I'd lived in New York for 30 years.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   I'd built my life there
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.160]   and had most of my friends and associates
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.360]   that I know here in America were New Yorkers.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.080]   So I thought, you know,
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.440]   these guys have been incredibly loyal to me as students.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.240]   So I should also be loyal to them, of course.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   So I decided that if they wanted to leave,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.800]   I would go with them.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.040]   We decided to go to Puerto Rico
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.840]   because there was a private gym
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440]   where we could train through the COVID period.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.400]   I personally wanted to go to Texas.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.720]   I thought that Texas was a better place for the team to go.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.400]   But many of the students,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.360]   including senior students like Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones,
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.840]   had been to Puerto Rico
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   and stayed with one of the head officials of ADCC, Mo Jassim.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.400]   So they loved their experience in Puerto Rico
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.720]   and almost everyone wanted to go down there.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.920]   So I tried to explain to them
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.960]   there's a world of difference
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.440]   between going to a place for vacation versus living there.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.160]   But that didn't have any effect.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.200]   So the decision was made,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.720]   a majority decision was made to go to Puerto Rico.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.320]   In Puerto Rico,
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.840]   the conditions in which the team lived
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.880]   changed significantly.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.720]   When you're in New York,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.620]   New York is such a big city
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.720]   that if there's any tension between team members,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.920]   and inevitably there will be in a competitive sport
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.080]   where everyone's fighting each other,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.640]   you can kind of bury them in the size of the city
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.480]   because there's so many distractions in New York.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.840]   You come in, you do your workout,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.920]   you go outside and it's New York City.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.280]   In Puerto Rico,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.800]   we lived in a very small local town, Dorado.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.640]   And most of the athletes were living with each other.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.120]   And so unlike New York where there was always a break,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   you trained together,
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.440]   but when training was over,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.080]   you went about your life in New York and New Jersey.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.020]   With everyone living in very close proximity to each other,
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.380]   any tensions got magnified
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.740]   because there was no relief from them.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.860]   You didn't get to get away from people.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.740]   If you had a problem with someone on the mat,
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.020]   well now you had to live with them
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.980]   for the rest of the day and the night.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.600]   And this goes on for long periods of time.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.460]   So I believe it had the effect of magnifying
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.600]   whatever tensions there were.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.260]   In particular, there was a family tension
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.480]   between two brothers, which magnified over time.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.900]   And so often as the case,
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.820]   you get two brothers growing up,
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.020]   one older, one younger,
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.740]   and the younger one wants to grow
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.180]   and feel somewhat like a young tree
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.900]   underneath a bigger tree.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.540]   And sometimes people just need their space.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.540]   So there was some unhappiness.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.500]   - As a younger brother, I can understand.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.980]   - As a little tree that had to grow up under a bigger tree.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.420]   - Yeah, so--
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.060]   - Fuck the big tree.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.900]   - My God.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.780]   - There's a lot of aggression I have to work on, I'm sorry.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.900]   - Unresolved family issues coming out here.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.100]   - I'm just kidding, I love you.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.360]   - He doesn't, he's lying.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.620]   So as time went by, these tensions started increasing.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.220]   They came to a point where it was difficult
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.260]   for them even to be in the training room together.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.020]   At that point, you're starting to,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.580]   once training takes a hit,
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.640]   then you gotta start to address these.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.140]   The attempts at reconciliation fell through
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.140]   and a decision was made to move to Texas.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.180]   I wanted everyone to move as a team.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.460]   What I wanted to do was keep the team together
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.020]   as long as the period leading up to ADCC
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.380]   so that everyone could train together.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.940]   So I said, okay, there's problems,
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.620]   but let's just tough it out one year.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.620]   We move to Texas, let's just go there and keep unity.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.260]   If some people don't wanna train with other people,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.300]   that's fine, but I believe that the team
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.980]   would be weakened by breaking apart.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.020]   I believe that they had an excellent rapport
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.060]   as training partners.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.540]   Their technical level was increasing dramatically.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.860]   Many of the younger athletes
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.360]   are really starting to come into their own
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.900]   and really develop well.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.540]   And so my take on it was, okay, if there's problems,
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.820]   so be it, but let's all just stay together
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.260]   until ADCC 2022 as a unified team.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.360]   Go out, prepare yourselves as best you can.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.340]   And then after that, we can make a decision
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.620]   as to whether we break up or not.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.780]   But that was rejected and the team split.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.860]   They moved to Austin.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.980]   We'd made prior arrangements to go to a local gym
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.980]   and they took that gym and we were left with no gym
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.580]   and more or less homeless in Austin.
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.020]   - A year out from ADCC.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.220]   - Yes, this is one year out.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.780]   So roughly three quarters of the competitive athletes
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.820]   left in one week.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.880]   So at that point, that was probably the lowest point
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.560]   because at that point,
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.360]   not only did we not have a place to train,
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.400]   we had very few training partners
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.020]   for the few that had remained.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.920]   And the main athlete in the team, Gordon Ryan,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.000]   was going through a particularly bad spell
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.880]   with his unresolved stomach issues.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.280]   And there was doubt as to whether or not
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.800]   he could compete at all
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.640]   and was actively thinking about retiring from the sport.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.400]   - So maybe not compete ever again, potentially.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.120]   - Yeah, so that was a time when it was like,
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.680]   man, the whole program seems to be dead in the water
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.520]   at this point.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.240]   Most of the competitive athletes were gone.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.880]   There were very few training partners
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.840]   for the few that remained.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.920]   And the main athlete around whom the group
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.640]   had initially bonded was seemingly out of action,
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.560]   possibly permanently.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.680]   - Where was your mind?
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.880]   Where were you mentally?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.720]   - My thinking is everything bad passes in time.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.560]   I've had a lot of bad points in my life.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   So my life experience is whenever things seem dark,
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.200]   have patience.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   Time will ultimately cure most ills.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.440]   Not all of them, but most of them.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.840]   And I'm confident that if you give me
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.560]   a new crop of students, I can produce magic,
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.040]   but it's gonna take time.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.120]   - So that confidence was in part a source of strength.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.800]   - Yes, it's just like, I wasn't confident
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.880]   that ADCC 2022 would go well
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.920]   because we only had one year without a gym
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.480]   and with a team that was completely broken up
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   to even attempt to get into ADCC.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.920]   So things looked a little grim,
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.680]   but I was confident given enough time,
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.720]   I'd get in a new group of students and work.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:37.160]   As it turns out, one of the demonstration partners
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.200]   that I used during filming for instructional videos
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.640]   who lives in Boston, Giancarlo Badoni,
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.400]   was interested in the idea of coming down and training,
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.640]   but he'd always felt like it would be difficult
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.440]   because there were people in his weight class
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.000]   who were already there and he felt it would be awkward.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.800]   But now that they had left, that opened up an area for him.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.200]   So he was the first one to come down.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.000]   He moved from Boston to Austin, Texas.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.160]   I began teaching at a local school.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.360]   It was rather like going back
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.040]   into my earliest days in Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.920]   I went from teaching at the big Henzo Gracie Academy
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.560]   to a tiny school in Puerto Rico
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.360]   and now an even smaller school in Austin, Texas.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   And locals would come in and train
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.600]   and I would watch every day,
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.160]   teaching there twice a day, seven days a week.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.760]   And I would see people come in and train
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.720]   and I would say, "This guy has some potential
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.600]   "or this guy has some potential."
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.760]   And I would recruit people and bring them to another gym
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.360]   where they would train with the professionals.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.120]   And if they proved adept and hardworking
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.000]   and someone who can work well in a team,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.600]   they would stay and build their skills.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.840]   As time went by,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.400]   more and more such people started coming in.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.320]   And we had some remarkable people
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.440]   like a young South African purple belt, Luke Griffith,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.560]   came in.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.440]   He had lost in the European trials for ADCC
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.720]   and he was down on his luck.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.600]   He came into Austin.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.360]   He did a show against a local purple belt and lost again.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.040]   So he was feeling bad about his performance and his future.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.720]   He came in and I thought he was a lovely kid
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.080]   who worked hard and trained well.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.800]   So he became one of the main training partners.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.720]   He was similar size to Gordon.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.080]   So I encouraged him to train with Gordon whenever he could.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.680]   And more and more people started coming in to train
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.160]   under that kind of basis.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.480]   One day I got a text from Gordon
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.680]   who was filming an instructional video in Boston.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.160]   He said, "Hey, Nicholas Miragali was training at this.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.760]   "He was shooting video at the same time as me
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.680]   "and we just did some grappling.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.600]   "He's a really nice guy
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.560]   "and he's literally never trained without a gi before."
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.520]   For those of you who don't know,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.440]   Nicholas Miragali is one of the outstanding
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.200]   gi jiu-jitsu competitors of his generation.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.760]   Has an amazing game and is a superstar
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.200]   with the gi side of the sport.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.840]   But had never even trained without a gi once in his life.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.800]   So his first ever no-gi training session
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.320]   is with Gordon Ryan, the best no-gi competitor of all time.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   And I remember Gordon texting me saying,
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.960]   "Hey, he's really talented, he's a nice guy
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.760]   "and he wants to come down to Texas and train."
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.000]   So I was like, "Yeah, sounds great."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.920]   So over time, just more and more people started coming in.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.120]   And I told everyone,
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.200]   "You guys are at a severe disadvantage.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.800]   "You've got very little time to get ready for ADCC."
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.080]   Luke wasn't even in ADCC, he had to win trials.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.640]   Same for Dan Manasoyo, he failed at trials
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.320]   and needed to get a win to even get into ADCC.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:53.160]   So around this time, a doctor suggested by Mo Jassum,
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.200]   who himself had stomach issues earlier in his life,
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.760]   began working with Gordon Ryan.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.680]   - And Mo's the organizer of ADCC.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.520]   - Yes.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.360]   - For people who don't know.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.120]   - Yeah, he's the head organizer.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:12.040]   He was able to get Gordon Ryan not cured,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.160]   but significantly better than he was before.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.880]   And to a level where Gordon could train
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.720]   up to five to six days a week.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.400]   And that was a big improvement on what was going on
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.320]   during the end of the time in Puerto Rico.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.440]   So things started moving.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   We had a core group of athletes training at a local gym,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.560]   which was very, very generously offered to us
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.560]   by the head manager of Roka Sunglasses,
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.120]   a company here in Austin, Texas.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.960]   They have a private corporate gym,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.320]   which we were able to train in.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.520]   And these talented youngsters from around the globe,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.960]   essentially, came together and I said,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.640]   "You guys are gonna have to train harder
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.840]   "than you've ever trained in your lives,
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.160]   "'cause you've got less time to get ready for this
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.960]   "than anyone, and you're gonna be going up against people
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.160]   "potentially who know exactly what I teach,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.520]   "'cause I've been teaching them a lot longer
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.440]   "than I've been teaching you."
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.520]   In addition to the other best people in the world.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.640]   So it was an incredible challenge for them.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.800]   And I must say, all of them gave
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.400]   literally everything they had.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.320]   Everything I asked for, they gave twice as much.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.040]   And we had a crazy training schedule,
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.600]   as many as three classes per day.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   I know that sounds easy, three classes a day,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.520]   but try doing it sometime.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.240]   These classes are not your average classes.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.560]   These are preparation for ADCC.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.840]   - So they're both mentally and physically draining.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.080]   - Very, very hard.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.840]   And we had many people come in
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.160]   and try to train alongside us,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.120]   and they fell off by the side of the road within days.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.260]   Forget about weeks, months, or a full year of this.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   I gave a very abbreviated set of skills for the athletes.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.640]   I chopped everything down to what I believe
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.560]   were the most essential skills.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.120]   Anything that wasn't essential to ADCC preparation
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.680]   was just pushed aside.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   And they had to focus almost entirely on ADCC,
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.080]   with one exception, I'll come to that soon,
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.080]   over the period of their training here in Austin.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.280]   So it was compacted by time
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.040]   and also by the breadth of skill that I taught.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.440]   Everything was just purely for ADCC preparation.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.040]   In a very short period of time,
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.520]   Dan Manasoyo and Luke Griffith and Oliver Tarza
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.920]   all won European trials and got into ADCC.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.920]   Nicholas Miragalli was already a superstar,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.480]   so he was invited, but he had to show himself.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.880]   So we enrolled him in local shows here in Austin
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.500]   where he had his first three no-gi matches.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.800]   And with each match, you could see progress being made.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.640]   And so that convinced the ADCC people,
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.840]   okay, he's good enough to compete.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.600]   He ended up winning decisively a match
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.960]   against one of the greatest American grapplers of all time,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.600]   Rafael Lovato.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.360]   And this was a clear sign that his skill level in no-gi
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.920]   was sufficient to justify an invite.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.920]   And by the way, Lovato had an incredible
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.440]   set of matches in this ADCC.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.760]   - Yes, that was actually very impressive.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.840]   - And retired.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.960]   - Yeah.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.200]   - Which is really impressive and heartbreaking as well.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.720]   But if you go out, that's a good way to go out.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.200]   - Indeed.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.400]   So there was this long and tough preparation,
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.760]   and it was compounded by the fact
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.080]   that as Gordon felt better,
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   he felt a need to build up his own competitive record
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.440]   prior to ADCC,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.200]   because he'd been inactive for so long
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.680]   with his stomach issue.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   So he proposed one of the most ambitious fight camps
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.520]   that I've ever heard of in grappling,
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.600]   which was he would take on the current WNO champion,
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.320]   Pedro Mourinho.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.620]   - Who's number one is WNO, yeah.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:24.800]   - And also, I believe, the current no-gi world champion
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.120]   in IBJJF as a tune-up match, as a warm-up match.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.800]   Then he would fight his old nemesis, Felipe Pena,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.480]   the only man who submitted Gordon at black belt
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   and had defeated Gordon in an ADCC match in 2017.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.680]   And then ADCC itself.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.120]   So there was gonna be three big high-profile matches
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.520]   back to back,
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.680]   and very different rule sets.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.600]   So WNO was a 15-minute match.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.220]   The fight with Felipe Pena was no time limit,
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.760]   which is a very different format to compete in,
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.280]   and then ADCC.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.120]   So we had to drag out a 14-week camp
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.480]   covering three matches with three different rule sets,
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.680]   which went in diametrically opposite directions.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.240]   And the entire team had to go through all of this
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.400]   over this 14-week period,
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.820]   in addition to the previous year
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.640]   that they had been working hard.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.600]   There was a further complication in the midst of all this.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.920]   Nicholas Miragalli had to go to the Ghee World Championships,
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.260]   and we had to throw an extra morning class for that
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.300]   to help him get ready.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.280]   Nicholas went on to win the openweight gold medal
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.740]   in the Ghee competition,
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.100]   and then the next day had to come back to Texas
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.760]   and begin his ADCC preparation.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.840]   It was a crazy, crazy time.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.340]   But they all came through it so well.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.620]   I'm immensely proud of what they did.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.500]   And shockingly, in the space of less than 12 months,
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.400]   we went from rock bottom
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   to having a more successful ADCC team performance
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.260]   than we did the previous ADCC.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.080]   It was, in fact,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.560]   the most successful team performance of the event,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.200]   and as testimony to how hard those young men worked
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.000]   in the course of less than a year to prepare themselves.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.240]   - If we could just linger on the low point,
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.640]   is it heartbreaking to you
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.480]   that the so-called Donahoe Death Squad split,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.160]   or the team as it was originally called split?
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.560]   You know, we live a short life on this earth,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.600]   and you put so much of your love and work into this team,
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.200]   and everybody put in the work.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.560]   Does it break your heart?
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.660]   - It was a sad time, yeah, it was.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:52.560]   It was, you know, I'm not a particularly emotional person,
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.960]   but it was an emotional time for everyone.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.080]   It was, it had an element of tragedy insofar as,
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.720]   not only was it a team breakup,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.560]   it was also a family breakup, which is much more serious.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:08.040]   I do believe that in time,
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:16.880]   even the most intense family breakups can be reconciled.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.920]   And I also believe that once dialogue begins,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.960]   people will remember just how easy it was
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.200]   for us to get along and how tight we were
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.620]   for many, many years.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.640]   It's so easy to let a minute of anger
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.640]   destroy 10 years of friendship.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.400]   So, but there's also the weight of those 10 years.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.120]   Like when I ran into the old squad members at ADCC,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.680]   we got along like a house on fire.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.840]   It's like we never had a problem.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.040]   - A house on fire is a good thing.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.880]   - Yes, yes, sorry, that's a New Zealand expression, yeah.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.440]   Yeah, that definitely could have gone the other way, right?
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.880]   So-- - Only a New Zealander
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.720]   would say that is a good thing, yeah.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.080]   - So there's, I still believe, you know,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.800]   in time things will be fine,
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   but there was an element where youngsters need to grow.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   And sometimes, think about it this way,
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.800]   from the athlete's perspective,
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.400]   there's definitely a generational problem.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.520]   I'm much older than my students, okay?
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.800]   And the years and the viewpoint that I have
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.600]   is a reflection of the time in which I grew up.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.920]   And they're from a completely different generation
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.820]   with a completely different worldview.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.680]   It's gotta be hard from the athlete's perspective
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.600]   when you're training seven days a week
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.120]   and you're getting very, very good.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.080]   You're beating everyone that's getting put in front of you.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.800]   You're losing very, very rarely,
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.640]   and it's always a tough competitive match when you do.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.120]   Everyone around you is calling you a superstar.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.680]   And you look phenomenal.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.640]   You check social media,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.400]   everyone's saying you're a god on the mat.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.480]   And then you come into the gym
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.240]   and there's some old guy telling you you're not good enough.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.120]   And every day it's like,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.880]   well, what does this guy want from me?
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.720]   How hard do I have to work?
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.080]   Like, you're not good enough.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.040]   Like, I want you to be the best in the world.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.840]   I want you to be good, I want you to be great.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.280]   And all of your friends are telling you all day,
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.000]   man, you're incredible, you submit me so easily to do this.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.280]   And then this old guy's just saying,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.600]   nah, you gotta get better, you gotta work more.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.160]   You're not working hard enough.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.480]   At some point, you're gonna be like,
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.080]   you know what, fuck this old guy.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.040]   Like, it's tough.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.680]   You know, mentally, I get why they left.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.320]   When I was 20 years old,
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.240]   I didn't get along with the authority figures at all.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.560]   And to have someone telling you,
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.520]   you've always gotta work that little bit harder,
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.040]   though your skillset's not complete,
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.720]   you still need this, this, and this,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.040]   when you're already doing very, very well,
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.640]   and far better than all but a tiny, tiny percentage
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.600]   of people, and then you've got this guy
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.840]   just constantly telling you, no, more has to be done.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.920]   You're not there yet.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.440]   I can, you know, of course I understand.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.080]   Let me just enjoy this more.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.200]   Like, it's always a choice in life.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.800]   You can be the best you possibly can,
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.880]   or you can go a route where you just get
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.080]   to enjoy life a little more.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.280]   You do other things, you know,
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.080]   like there's more to life than just the inside of a gym
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.000]   and learning how to do a better heel hook
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.240]   or a better double leg.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   So of course, you know, years go by,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.560]   you wanna try other things,
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.320]   and you have to make this choice in life
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.900]   between extreme excellence versus being incredibly good,
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.200]   but maybe just enjoying my life a little more.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.000]   - It's so interesting that incredibly good
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.640]   is a hard thing to deal with.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.680]   I saw, like, when Kayla Harrison won her first gold medal
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   at the Olympics, you know, to go back to the gym
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.600]   and to trust, again, maybe the old man,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.560]   you're being too harsh on yourself,
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.160]   but to trust the old man.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.920]   So Jimmy Page, you're on Jimmy Page,
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.280]   you're senior in that case, to say,
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.400]   "Okay, we're gonna go back to this grind."
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.380]   And there's still a path to improvement.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.600]   There's still a lot to grow and still have the humility,
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.280]   even though you've just demonstrated greatness.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   So really good is just a stepping stone to greatness.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.840]   That's really tough for athletes.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.320]   Like, winning is actually very difficult.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.880]   Gold medals are very difficult.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.960]   Plus there's the personal stuff of depression
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.320]   that comes with that, which is you give so much of yourself
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.960]   to trying to win that.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.280]   And once you do, there's a lot of personal stuff
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.000]   you have to deal with, which is like,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.300]   what do I want from life?
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.560]   To understand what is exactly what am I chasing?
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.740]   Is it just winning,
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.680]   or is it some bigger picture of excellence
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.560]   that's beyond just winning?
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.920]   So all of that mixed up together.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.840]   And then when you have to be, as a team,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.080]   really close together, there's the personal relationships,
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.560]   all of that gets exacerbated.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.860]   Do you think the team ever gets back together?
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.120]   - I think there's definitely a chance of that.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.440]   Right now, I think they have an excellent team themselves,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.480]   and they're doing very well.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.680]   They had an excellent performance at ADCC.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.300]   So there's not a need for them to come to us.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.660]   It's not like they lack anything.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.080]   They still remember everything I taught them.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.660]   They still coach and teach
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.080]   with the same methodology that I taught them.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.040]   So I don't think they have any need to do so.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.220]   If they did, it would be because they wanted to.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.880]   I still think many of the same personality conflicts
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.380]   that originated the conflict would reemerge currently
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.120]   if they started training together.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.860]   - By the way, to pile on the compliments,
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.220]   they have really nice merch too.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.820]   The t-shirts are just excellent.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.500]   What have you learned from that process
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.700]   about how to have a team with personal conflicts?
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.340]   Do you have to deal with these giant egos as well?
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.180]   - Yeah.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.140]   - 'Cause the ego is in part a superpower too,
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.260]   so you don't wanna-
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.780]   - Yeah, you don't wanna suppress egos.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.020]   I always laugh when people say,
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.580]   "Leave your ego at the door."
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.340]   It's like, what do you think drives competition?
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.580]   If you wanna be good at anything in life,
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.680]   you gotta have an ego.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.620]   No, I don't believe it's good or even a healthy thing
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.540]   to suppress egos.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.460]   I'm a realist and I understand that this is a sport
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.340]   where they make one gold medal per weight division.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.820]   As guys get better, they're gonna be looking
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.660]   at their training partners and thinking like,
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.780]   I'm gonna have to fight this guy one day.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.300]   And they're training next to each other.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.740]   Of course, there's gonna be tension.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.620]   There's always gonna be disagreements
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.620]   about what's the right way to act around certain people,
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.820]   certain issues, and people are gonna come into conflict.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.820]   Everyone's being programmed to be an alpha competitor.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.500]   You get a room full of people like that,
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.140]   there's gonna be conflict.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.300]   Now, your question was,
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.180]   well, is there a way to resolve this?
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.020]   Yeah, there was.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.420]   And for eight to nine years,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   I was very successful with this.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.600]   But there's also a tipping point
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.100]   where things can flare out of control
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.180]   and there will be periodic breakups.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.380]   You're not the first students I had that left.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.500]   I've been coaching a lot longer
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.540]   than I've been coaching the squad.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.580]   And I'm sure in the future,
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.980]   there'll be other students who leave me.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.100]   That's just the nature of the beast.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.800]   It's sad when it happens, but life goes on.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.980]   - Like Bukowski said, love is a fog that fades
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.100]   with the first daylight of reality or something like that.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.040]   So even love is temporary.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.500]   Let me ask you about leading up the preparation
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.340]   for the athletes.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.100]   I mean, this is such, given the darkness from a year ago
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.280]   from which you had to find glimmers of light
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.240]   and try to get greatness out of athletes,
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.380]   what was the mental preparation like?
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.580]   For Gordon, for Nicholas, for Giancarlo,
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.780]   for the other athletes,
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.420]   what was the mental side of things like?
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.820]   Is there some key insights you can give
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.220]   to their mental preparation?
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.500]   - I really think that people,
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.400]   when they talk about mental preparation,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.060]   need to take a step back and realize
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.460]   that almost every element of what people describe
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.440]   as mental preparation has physical underpinnings.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:52.980]   Literally 95% of what I teach the athletes
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.460]   is physical skills.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:00.460]   And it's my belief that every mental aspect of competition,
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.220]   the most important, which will be confidence on stage,
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.220]   is a direct result of the accumulation of physical skills.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.140]   People tend to see things like confidence
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.280]   as a mental state.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:22.100]   It is, but it comes out of the performance
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.540]   of physical skills.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:29.100]   All my life, I've seen sports psychologists
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.260]   try to create confidence in athletes
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.540]   through non-physical means.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.540]   And it always ends up being the same kind
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.500]   of cheesy motivational speeches,
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.260]   highlight video reels where they try
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.460]   to pump artificial confidence into people.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.060]   And I've never been impressed by this,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.540]   nor have I seen it have any kind of positive effect
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.940]   on athlete performance.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.420]   What I do see build confidence is the sense
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.780]   that athletes are developing skills
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.860]   and using them successfully under conditions
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.220]   that closely mirror the event they're preparing for.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.040]   Once they get this down,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.740]   that's where true confidence comes from.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.660]   Confidence doesn't come from words,
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.860]   it comes from accumulated skills,
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:23.860]   which experience shows you have been responsible
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.060]   for successful performances in the past.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.660]   And if you accumulate enough of these,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.820]   your confidence rises.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.940]   So when it comes to the mental aspects of competition,
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.660]   I created a program where everyone was given a set
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.700]   of skills that they had to work on,
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.540]   skills directly related to what I believe
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.740]   is the most important elements of success
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.940]   in ADCC competition.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.100]   In the gym, they accumulated those skills over time.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.140]   I do it in two different ways,
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.100]   depending on whether these are offensive skills
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.900]   or defensive skills.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.100]   For the accumulation of offensive skills,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.340]   I like to have my athletes work with athletes
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.740]   who are lesser than themselves in ability,
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.700]   so that they start to gain confidence over time.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.300]   Just as you would never send a beginner
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.940]   into a weightlifting gym and put 500 pounds on the bar
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.220]   and tell them to lift it.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.980]   Rather you would start with a wooden bar,
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.900]   then the metal bar,
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.660]   and then gradually accumulate weight over time
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.460]   so you get a progression in weightlifting.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.700]   So too in jiu-jitsu, you don't take a brand new move
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.940]   and say, "Okay, do it on Gordon Ryan."
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.140]   Never gonna succeed.
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.740]   I have the athletes practice their offense on blue belts
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.860]   and work their way up.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.140]   Defense, on the other hand,
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.020]   you've got to start them in the deep end of the pool
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.620]   so that they start to see what are their vulnerabilities.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.500]   So I put them with highly competitive athletes
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.780]   at the start so they can see,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.460]   "Okay, there is a problem here."
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.020]   And then even in defense,
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.460]   they start off with lower belts
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.380]   and build up their confidence over time.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.700]   So just as a weightlifter builds up his ability
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.900]   to build weight, sorry, to lift weight over time,
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.340]   so too a jiu-jitsu player does it
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.540]   by gradually increasing resistance.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.820]   Now in jiu-jitsu, resistance is not done by weight,
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.500]   it's done by skill level.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.300]   And so over time,
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.460]   they started to accumulate this experience.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:22.900]   In time, we were able to switch off
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.460]   and have them go against very, very tough athletes,
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.380]   each other.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.180]   So Luke Griffith will do a full power match
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.340]   with Gordon Ryan.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.540]   Now they're fully aware that there's no one better
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.660]   in the world than Gordon Ryan.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.780]   So if you have a competitive match with Gordon Ryan,
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.660]   that's a very, very healthy sign.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.380]   So they went from the start
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.940]   where they were being programmed
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.340]   going against relatively mild resistance
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.780]   and building up over time,
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.580]   and then building up to the greatest resistance possible
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.500]   in the sport of jiu-jitsu.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.700]   And their goal is not to win, obviously,
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.260]   but their goal is to provide a competitive match.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.380]   Now, Gordon doesn't have any confidence issues.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.540]   So for him, it's just good, hard competitive training
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.940]   against people that are in some ways better than those
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.860]   you'll be facing in competition.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.940]   For the other guys, it's getting a clear assessment
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.180]   of what their current skill level is
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.700]   by going against the best there is.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.020]   Then we add to this a competitive schedule
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.180]   where the athletes have to go out into competition
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.860]   so they get used to the idea of performing
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.900]   in front of strangers on stage,
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.140]   getting used to the strange elements of going out,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.260]   being observed and judged by people you don't know
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.540]   in a performance atmosphere.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.580]   And so they were all given matches
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.300]   and WNO competition leading up to the event,
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.660]   ADCC trials, local grappling events here in Austin,
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.740]   and given a competitive schedule to fight
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.660]   and prepare them for ADCC.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.860]   Obviously, as ADCC got closer and closer,
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.620]   this was pulled back because of the danger of injury.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.780]   So within about three weeks out
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.380]   was the last time we had a competition.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.660]   And by this method, confidence starts to grow.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.220]   And so the mental preparation
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.020]   came out of those physical underpinnings,
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.300]   the idea of progressive resistance increasing over time
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.140]   for both offense and defense,
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.780]   building up to a peak where they go in
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.660]   against the best athlete in the world
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.580]   so they can get an accurate assessment of where they stand.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.140]   Once you're given a competitive match
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.620]   to the best guy in the world,
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.140]   you know damn well that when you go out in ADCC,
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.260]   you're ready to fight anybody.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.460]   - And defense is broadly defined.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.460]   So defense in symmetrical positions,
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.860]   like positions like guard,
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.700]   and then defense also includes
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.420]   escaping from horrible positions.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.980]   - Yes, we're big believers in the idea of depth of defense.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.980]   The idea that you should be able to mount defense
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.580]   all the way through from early stages
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.860]   based mostly around anticipation
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.380]   of identifying danger visually before it emerges,
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.740]   and all the way through to the deepest levels of defense
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.900]   where you are 100% defensive in terrible positions,
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.420]   and you have to claw your way out over time
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.060]   and get back to a neutral position,
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.620]   or even better, back to an attacking position.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.020]   - You have an Instagram post on this topic.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.740]   When you get ready to step out
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.900]   for the biggest moment of your life,
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.020]   ask yourself one question.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.500]   How different is this really from what I do every day?
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.980]   If the answer's not very different at all,
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.460]   then step forward with confidence,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.860]   and do what you do every day in the same manner,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.860]   and ignore the hype and distraction.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.220]   You're ready for action.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.460]   By the way, for people who don't know,
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.620]   you need to follow @donahardjohn on Instagram,
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.260]   'cause you have nuggets,
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.180]   or large buckets of nuggets of wisdom, often,
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.980]   which is quite profound, even bigger than jiu-jitsu.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.380]   But anyway, so there's some aspect
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.540]   where you want to mimic the conditions
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:02.100]   of your daily training in intensity,
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.860]   and in what force, or physical,
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.500]   to that of the actual matches.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.260]   - You asked a question about mental training.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.700]   For me, the central focus of whatever small amount
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.100]   of mental training I give my students
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.680]   comes down to a very, very simple concept to understand.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.340]   This is the idea of identifying competition
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.180]   in terms of its normalcy.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.700]   Most people see training and competition
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.540]   as two different things.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.420]   Training is normal activity that you do every day,
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.540]   and competition is the exception.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.460]   Okay, it's different.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.340]   You're going out, there's people watching you.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.840]   There's a big crowd, they're making lots of noise.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.940]   In fact, the promoters of shows
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.140]   go out of their way to reinforce this.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.000]   Look at, for example, ADCC,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.420]   when Gordon Ryan went to fight Andre Galvan.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   Okay, do they just come out on the mat and fight each other?
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.260]   Absolutely not.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.060]   There's music, there's pageantry, there's fireballs.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.820]   They're literally shooting fireballs.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.340]   - Yeah, some dude in a tie sitting with Joe Rogan.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.180]   - I heard about that guy.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.380]   - Some meathead podcaster, comedian, whatever.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.340]   - Which one was the meathead?
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.300]   - Well played, John Donahue, well played.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.440]   - But you see what they're trying to do.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.880]   They're trying to create theater and pageantry,
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.700]   when in fact, it's just a grappling match.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.460]   It's just two athletes, a referee and a rule set.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.300]   That's the reality.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.580]   Now what they try to sell you is something
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.900]   which is not reality,
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.200]   which is this is somehow bigger and different.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.800]   And they reinforce this with pageantry and theater
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.860]   so that it becomes not just a grappling match,
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.500]   but a grappling performance,
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.180]   the same way you have a theater performance.
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.700]   And my goal as a coach is to dispel that
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.300]   and say when you go out there,
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.500]   there's only one reality,
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   you, him and the referee reinforcing a rule set, that's it.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.620]   Everything else you see, the smoke, the fire,
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.600]   the music is an illusion.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.980]   And it's put there intentionally
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.660]   to make you feel a certain kind of way.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.780]   And your whole goal is to see this as an illusion
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.060]   and walk out and see only the reality,
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.300]   which is that this is the same damn thing
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.580]   you do every day in the gym.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.020]   The only difference is you're going with a guy
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.740]   you've never grappled before.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.460]   - So the actual act of removing the illusion
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.180]   or realizing that it is an illusion,
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.500]   how do you practice that?
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.620]   So when you step on the mat--
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.180]   - Once you're aware of it, I always have them,
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.900]   it's like when you see a magician
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.140]   and you have his tricks explained to you,
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:44.260]   you never see the magic again.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.860]   The first time you see a good card trick
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.500]   from a good magician, it's oh my God.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.820]   Then when they explain it to you,
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.820]   I did this, this, and this, step one, step two,
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.220]   then you look at it like, it's not that special.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.780]   And when you explain to people
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.120]   this idea of the pageantry as an illusion,
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.980]   then just as when you watch the magician
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.180]   and you learn the trick, all the magic flies out the window,
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.580]   so too with the nervous response.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.660]   - So that's for the pageantry,
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.340]   but what about maybe the physical intensity of competition?
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.740]   Isn't there an extra--
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.900]   - No, it's the same in every competition.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.500]   It's not like they're twice as strong
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.820]   in ADCC as they are in the IBJF World Championships.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.060]   The physical intensity is always pretty much the same.
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.300]   They experience it every day in the gym.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.740]   If you go out and you grapple Gordon Ryan,
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.980]   it's not like the next guy you grapple
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.740]   is gonna be twice as strong as him or twice as fast.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.180]   He's gonna be a little stronger, a little faster,
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.820]   but not so much so that it completely changes
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.120]   your approach to the game.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.940]   There's not that much difference
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.060]   between the human bodies out there on the stage.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.260]   So if you've felt intensity before,
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.020]   you're not gonna be shocked by ADCC.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.580]   - But in terms of in training,
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.020]   do you have to try to match the intensity of competition?
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.220]   - No, that would be foolish.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.180]   Every athlete in the gym would be injured.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   You can do it for short periods of time,
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:15.180]   but the training has to be carefully monitored
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.100]   in terms of intensity levels.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.980]   We're training seven days a week,
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.460]   a minimum of twice a day.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:25.300]   You've gotta keep things under wraps.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.420]   Every other workout, you can have one of the five rounds
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.980]   can be full power, but not seven days a week,
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.820]   three times a day.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.660]   That's just gonna break bodies.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.980]   - And the full power is just a reminder of--
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.660]   - It's more about skill development.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.780]   For us, it always comes back to skill development.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.900]   - But what about matching the feeling
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.820]   of the intensity of competition?
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.980]   - Yeah, periodically.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.300]   - Periodically, rarely. - But it can't be
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.500]   every single time.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.940]   Not really, it's not rare.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:58.180]   - Meaning like one--
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.860]   - Out of three hours of hard sparring per day,
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.780]   15 minutes might be 100% full power.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.420]   That way, that's more than enough
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.620]   to get psychologically ready for the intensity of conflict,
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.540]   but won't break your body over time.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.540]   - Intensity of conflict, that's well put.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:23.220]   Competition, doesn't it have that extra level of animosity?
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.940]   It's a little bit more conflict than it is--
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.780]   - It can.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.420]   Sometimes there's personality differences.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.980]   For example, like Gordon Ryan and Felipe Pena,
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.100]   they admire each other a lot.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.300]   They respect each other's skills,
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.020]   but they certainly don't love each other, that's for sure.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.980]   So there can be certain matchup
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.780]   where there's more intensity.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.380]   But then there's other matchups
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.420]   where the two athletes come out
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.460]   and it's no more intense than a hard sparring session.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.140]   - So first of all, 'cause I would love to look
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.500]   at a couple of matches with you.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.180]   And before that, let me say big thank you to Flow Grappling
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.700]   for first of all, helping the sport of grappling
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.700]   and jujitsu in general by having organized footage
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:17.140]   and tournaments that sort of show the sport
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.580]   in its best light to the world.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.260]   And they do an incredible job of that.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.780]   So if you're interested in supporting grappling
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.740]   as a sport, helping it grow,
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.380]   you should definitely support Flow Grappling.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.940]   Go to their website, sign up.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.900]   Also Flow Wrestling, I'm a huge fan of wrestling.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:34.700]   So maybe there'll be a Flow Judo at some point.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.100]   They don't currently, I don't think,
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.340]   do any major judo stuff.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:41.100]   So anyway, I'm a big supporter of theirs
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:46.060]   and I do have criticism that they know about,
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.980]   which is I hope they continue to improve
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.060]   on the aspect of making the footage discoverable
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.340]   and accessible, making it easy for you to do search
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.340]   through Google and on their website to find matches,
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.180]   to get excited.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.540]   Like if me and Joe Rogan are getting excited
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.420]   about a particular match,
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:05.420]   we wanna be able to pull it up super quickly.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.460]   Wanna be able to pull up Gordon Ryan's matches
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.620]   super quickly from ADCC, make it super easy to show
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.340]   and share if we have to pay for it, fine,
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.740]   but make it easy.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:20.140]   And when you sign up for Flow, it should be one click,
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.260]   not five clicks.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.260]   It should be one click.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.340]   It should be easy.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.140]   I think it's inexpensive.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.300]   If you care about grappling,
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.900]   it's definitely worth it, you should sign up.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.740]   Anyway, my love goes out to Flow Grappling
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.660]   and also my love goes out to Moe Jassim, as we said.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.580]   He's the organizer of ADCC.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.660]   The next one is in 2024.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.140]   - It should be 2024.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.500]   - Well, you should follow ADCC_official on Instagram
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.020]   and just send as much love towards Moe and ADCC in general.
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.500]   It's the, like I said, the most prestigious,
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.660]   it's like where the best grapplers in the world show up.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.460]   And the magic happens.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.260]   It's like some of the most historic matches
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.660]   in grappling and jiu-jitsu ever happened on that stage.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.220]   Anyway, if I could talk about some
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.140]   of the interesting performances for the athletes you coach,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.300]   you post on Instagram, let's start with Gordon Ryan.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.180]   Gordon Ryan, ADCC 2022.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.860]   The greatest event in grappling history is over.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.740]   New stars emerged, established stars shone bright again,
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.060]   but one man stood above all like a colossus,
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.340]   Gordon Ryan.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.780]   You have a way with words, John Donner.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.340]   I have seen many incredible feats of grappling,
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.500]   but I've never saw a performance like this.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.540]   For many, Mr. Ryan is a polarizing figure in the sport.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.060]   For many others, an inspiration to look up to.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.500]   But after this weekend, there was no disagreement
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.260]   amongst haters and fans about his merit.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.060]   He is the best ever.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.700]   It was a long and difficult journey to ADCC 2022.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:58.540]   Just one year ago, and so on as you told the story,
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.580]   it was a virtuoso performance of unmatched technique,
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.220]   preparation, and confidence.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.940]   No one else can claim credit for this achievement.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.780]   This was his and his alone.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.260]   No one else today brings together technical depth,
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.300]   tactical insight, and confidence to use them
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.020]   on stage as he does.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.140]   I had many students, but I only one Gordon Ryan.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.820]   And I think Gordon responded,
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.020]   "All this is true besides the credit that sits with you."
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:26.500]   Thank you, and a heart emoji, very nice.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.900]   So anyway, that's as a way of introduction to Gordon Ryan.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.260]   Can you take me through his set of performances
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.300]   and maybe any matches that stand out?
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:40.180]   So he competed in his division,
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.220]   which is the plus 99 kilos,
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.500]   and in the Superfight against Andre Gauvard.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.460]   - That's correct.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.540]   This was in fact the first time in history
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.100]   that this was allowed.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.140]   For your listeners who don't follow grappling,
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.420]   we may have been very rude
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.900]   and just throwing a lot of stuff at you
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.060]   without explaining ourselves.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.300]   First of all, ADCC is like the Olympics of grappling.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.740]   It occurs every two years.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.740]   You can either qualify for the event
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:11.260]   through winning matches in a qualification process,
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.740]   or you can be invited.
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.340]   The only people who get invited are either former winners
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.300]   or people in the sport who are just
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.020]   widely recognized superstars
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.620]   who bring some kind of brand value,
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.860]   who have proven in the past
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.100]   that they have what it takes to compete at that level.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.700]   In this format, there are two kinds of matches.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:37.540]   There are weight division matches
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.340]   in which you compete against people
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.100]   roughly your own size and weight.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:50.180]   There is an open weight where anyone of any size can enter.
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.540]   So you can have very small people
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.940]   fighting very large people.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.620]   And there is a second category called a super fight
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.620]   where established champions
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.620]   who have won previous open weight tournaments
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:07.820]   fight each other in one-off battles,
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.500]   one athlete against another.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.580]   So in most of the matches,
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.260]   you will fight repetitively over time
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.980]   towards a gold medal.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.420]   But in one category, you fight one fight,
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.580]   the so-called super fight,
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.260]   which is usually the headline fight of the event.
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:26.300]   Traditionally, if you were in the super fight,
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:30.140]   you could not compete in the weight categories.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.940]   It was seen as too risky
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:35.740]   because you might get injured during the weight category,
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:39.260]   or you might have to fight four very tough fights in a row
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.300]   and get exhausted so that you're ineffective
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.500]   during the main event of the show, the super fight.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.940]   So throughout its history,
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.100]   ADCC has always resisted the idea
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.140]   of an athlete being allowed to do both weight category
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.300]   and a super fight.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.220]   It's never happened before.
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.860]   Gordon Ryan requested to be able to do this
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:03.340]   because of his extraordinary stature in the sport,
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.420]   the ADCC organization granted his request.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.900]   That was the first time ever.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.540]   In addition, Gordon Ryan would be fighting
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.140]   to be the first person to win three gold medals
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.540]   in three different weight categories.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.140]   This has never been done before.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.620]   So it was a huge event on Gordon's part.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.180]   And bear in mind also that prior to this event,
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:28.820]   he had fought just a month and a half earlier
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.980]   against a former ADCC open weight champion, Felipe Pena,
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.180]   who had defeated him in the past
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.540]   in a completely different rule set.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.780]   And then previous to that,
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.420]   against the current world champion.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.660]   So there'd been a buildup to this.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:45.420]   So he'd been very active coming up to the event.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.660]   And then he went in to fight arguably
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:51.380]   the greatest ADCC champion of all time, Andre Galvan,
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.540]   which would occur late on Sunday
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.740]   and would have to fight the toughest people,
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:01.780]   including the possibility of fighting his nemesis,
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.420]   Felipe Pena in the weight division
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.500]   prior to getting to the super fight.
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.060]   So there was genuine concern here
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.940]   that he may have completely overstepped himself.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.540]   The biggest concern I had as a coach,
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.700]   and I'm sure the organizers, Mojaz,
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.060]   must've had the same concern,
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.780]   is that he would get injured or exhausted
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.380]   fighting in his weight division.
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:27.660]   There were two athletes in particular, Felipe Pena,
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.780]   who had given Gordon a very tough 40 minute match
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:35.780]   in a no rules setting shortly before ADCC.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:39.380]   And his former training partner, Nick Rodriguez,
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.740]   who were expected to give Gordon very, very tough matches
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.060]   if they came up against each other.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.940]   So there was a genuine concern
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.780]   that Gordon may burn himself out
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.540]   before he even got to fight the guy
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.380]   who most people believe
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.560]   is the greatest ADCC champion of all time.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.940]   So our concern was how do we manage this?
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:04.700]   So what we looked for is extremely efficient methods
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.340]   of reducing the time of the matches,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.340]   making the matches as short as possible.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:14.420]   Our favorite way to fight bigger, stronger athletes,
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.900]   and I think Gordon was the lightest athlete
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.140]   in his weight division.
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.900]   Everyone goes, "Oh, Gordon's so big and strong."
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.220]   He's actually quite light.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:28.660]   I think he was outweighed by almost all of his opponents.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.260]   - It's nice to see Gordon looking small
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.460]   relative to his opponents, which is absurd to say,
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.660]   but it is the open division, plus 99 kilos.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.980]   - It was plus 99 kilos.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.060]   - Right, that's what I mean, sorry, by open, plus 99 kilos.
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.220]   - Everyone looks like the Incredible Hulk, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.740]   - So our big thing is when we fight bigger,
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.100]   stronger opponents, we always go in two directions.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.580]   You either go for the legs or you go for the back.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:55.220]   And so we constructed strategies
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.740]   based around those two methods.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.740]   - So going for submissions.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.940]   And we should also mention that ADCC rule set
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.860]   is for regular matches, I think it's five minutes
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.500]   and five minutes, total is 10 minutes,
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.940]   and then for finals matches, it's 20 minutes.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.500]   And half the time is spent with no points.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.260]   - So these can be very, very long matches.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.820]   I mean, to put this into perspective,
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.180]   a modern judo match is five minutes.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.780]   A modern wrestling match, I believe,
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.660]   is six minutes in international freestyle.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.620]   So these matches can be 40 minutes long.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:28.500]   Now that's a long, long grappling match.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.300]   - And depending on how you compete in it,
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.660]   that can have a huge toll on you.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.820]   - Absolutely, you can get to the finals
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.140]   and just be absolutely spent.
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.780]   So our whole thing is, okay, Gordon's gotta
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.420]   not only get to the finals, then he's gotta fight
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   the toughest ADCC grappler of all time,
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.460]   after that.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:48.300]   So we were looking for quick and energy efficient matches.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.900]   And that meant going to the back or going to the legs.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.980]   And in the overwhelming majority of cases,
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:54.900]   that's exactly what he did.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.260]   He was able to get some very, very quick matches,
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.220]   courtesy of leg lock finishes.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.980]   And in the few cases where he didn't finish on legs,
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.260]   then he would simply take his opponents back.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:11.260]   And that's a very low stress position to occupy.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.460]   In one case, his opponent deliberately kept his back
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.980]   on the ground to prevent the back take,
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.980]   and he just chose mounted position instead.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.300]   And so he was able to go through his weight division
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:24.020]   with extremely low energy expenditure,
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.700]   which set him up well to go into the finals.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.500]   No injuries, very little energy expenditure.
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.660]   Now it sounds easy to say that,
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.860]   okay, the strategy worked.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.620]   But in order to get that strategy to work,
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.180]   you have to have one hell of a set of skills.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.500]   And we can see those now.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:45.340]   Would you like to?
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.460]   - Yeah, I would love to go through them.
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.420]   And I should also mention,
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.060]   for people just listening to this,
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.180]   I'll try to commentate on different things we'll look at.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:57.340]   But the thing that was made clear is,
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.940]   maybe you can speak to that.
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.180]   Maybe to you it looks like efficiency,
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:08.540]   but to me it looked like Gordon was not even trying.
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:13.340]   There was a relaxed aspect to the whole thing.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.100]   So maybe it had to do with saving energy,
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.340]   but he made it look very easy.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.980]   And he made the path to submission look very easy.
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.260]   So here the first match against an opponent
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.940]   that again looks bigger than him.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:29.860]   - Okay, I'll just give an initial comment here.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.580]   First, you'll see that Gordon elected
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.660]   to sit to the bottom position.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.140]   The hardest work in submission grappling
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.900]   is when two athletes take the standing position
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.860]   and joust for takedowns.
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.300]   That's where most of the energy gets burned up.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.580]   So working on the idea of energy efficiency,
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:50.100]   let's go out and we chose to sit into guard position
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.780]   and then start looking to access our opponent's back.
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.380]   Because of our opponent's head position,
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.220]   a far side arm drag makes a lot of sense.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.300]   Gordon's able to beat the arm
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.180]   and quickly get behind his opponent.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.300]   Now the question is gonna be
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.780]   getting into a scoring position.
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.740]   It's too early to score at this point,
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.740]   but we're just concerned at this stage
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:06.980]   of just energy expenditure
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.460]   and make the other guy work harder than us.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.940]   - So Gordon did arm drag to the back
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:12.740]   and now is working on the hooks.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.700]   - The hooks are not particularly important here.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.980]   He'll use it just to get stability on his opponent.
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.460]   But interestingly, his opponent here
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.900]   had an interesting strategy too,
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.460]   which was to occupy bottom turtle position
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:31.100]   and look to get to the critical five point,
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.380]   sorry, five minute demarcation point
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.620]   where points begin to get scored.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.580]   His idea, I believe, I'm speculating here
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:38.940]   based on his actions,
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.500]   was to keep Gordon at bay in a defensive turtle position
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.500]   until a five minute mark occurred.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.980]   In which case he would shake Gordon off,
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.900]   walk away and force a takedown battle.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.220]   - How many people are comfortable in that?
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.740]   And what do you think about the defensive turtle position
[00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.140]   versus always trying to come back to guard?
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.460]   - Turtle position is the second bottom position of Jiu Jitsu.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.060]   Many people only associate guard position
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.380]   with bottom position in Jiu Jitsu.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.860]   That's naive.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.540]   There's two, there's guard position and turtle position.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:10.380]   Now, as a general rule,
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.460]   guard position offers a much, much greater variety
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.020]   of attacking options than turtle position does.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:22.060]   But that's not to say turtle position
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.980]   absolutely can be an effective bottom position.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.900]   You can work effectively from there.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.980]   - So there's some case to be made that
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.300]   to wait out five minutes, turtle might be-
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.020]   - I mean, I personally think against Gordon Ryan,
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.940]   I mean, I admire the fellow's courage.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.060]   It's not easy.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.580]   But there was a logic to what he was doing.
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:45.700]   People think, oh, he just got his back taken so easily,
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.180]   but he did have a strategy.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.900]   Now, did he pick the right person
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.060]   to use that strategy against?
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:51.940]   Probably not.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:56.580]   - So Gordon's able to break the turtle down,
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:57.980]   get one hook in.
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:03.380]   At which point is this becoming
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.140]   an extremely controlling position with Gordon in the back?
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.940]   At which point is there, are you happy with where it is?
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.740]   - At this point, it just started to dawn on me at this point
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.380]   that this guy actually had a strategy,
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.980]   which was to maintain a prone position that he's in now
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:22.420]   and then shake Gordon off after the five minute mark.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:25.820]   So once that became obvious,
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.780]   then I was now starting to look at the clock
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.660]   and how close we are.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:31.500]   If we can take it up to five minutes.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:37.020]   Right now, this guy's only intention
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.500]   is to stop Gordon from strangling him and finish.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:50.300]   Okay, now the guy's trying to go up in vertical,
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.140]   freeze it there.
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:53.780]   Now, do you see how he's taking his elbows off the mat
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.180]   in turtle position?
[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.460]   In jiu-jitsu, there's only one reason
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.260]   you take your elbows off the mat from turtle position,
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.220]   that's to stand up.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.500]   So now it's clear at this point what his actual strategy is.
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.180]   It's to get up, force a standing confrontation,
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.500]   win a takedown battle and beat Gordon by points.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.220]   So he did have a strategy.
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.260]   Now, our counter strategy is always based
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.900]   around the power half Nelson.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.940]   This is a common move in the sport of wrestling
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.740]   and it's a great way to break people down
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.380]   as they try to stand up.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.460]   - That looks so heavy.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.020]   - Yeah, I mean, Gordon is a master of it.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:24.740]   - So there's a power half Nelson that Gordon has on him
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.900]   as the elbows are off the ground
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:28.940]   and knees are off the ground.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:31.180]   - He's going to return his opponent to the mat.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.580]   And as you can see, he's successful in doing so.
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.060]   And now it's clear what the man's strategy is.
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.140]   So I'm calling to Gordon to break him down to a hip.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.660]   You put a man on a hip, he can't stand up.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.940]   Gordon successfully does it, traps the shoulder
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.860]   using that one-on-one grip with his right hand,
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.420]   puts him down to a shoulder and a hip.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.460]   That means standing up is no longer an option
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.660]   for his opponent.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.060]   Now Gordon goes in, he's already scoring
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.380]   because of the turtle position that he's in.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.700]   His opponent stays down on his shoulder.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.820]   Now Gordon's responsibility is to start looking
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.140]   for the stranglehold.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.580]   His opponent has basic defensive structures,
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.860]   discipline with his chin, keeps the chin down.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.220]   Gordon is a master of tying up defensive arms
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.700]   and penetrating under the chin to get to a strangle.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.100]   And you'll see that shortly.
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.260]   There's the trapping of the arm.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:19.860]   Notice that no advanced grips were required.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.260]   It was just a spontaneous trap.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.860]   There's the penetration of the neck.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.500]   - So the arm was trapped with the leg.
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.300]   - Yeah, so now he's only got one defensive arm
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.340]   and he's just taking that away with his left hand
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.740]   and he gets a one-handed strangle for the finish.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:38.860]   - And it looks like not much energy was expanded
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.220]   during that process. - Very little, yeah.
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.900]   So that's, the tournament got off to a very smooth start.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.340]   Very little energy expenditure, no injuries,
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.580]   and a submission win.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:53.220]   - Does that, there's a kind of certain look to Gordon
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.180]   of, that could be interpreted as nervousness.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.180]   That was an incorrect interpretation?
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.580]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.820]   - So there's a,
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:05.700]   - What do you interpret as nervous behavior?
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.420]   - Well, this is, part of me is trolling,
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:12.740]   but sometimes on the surface,
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:17.740]   confident behavior can look like, almost like anger.
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.600]   And there's,
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:27.580]   Gordon's face had like a vulnerability to it.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.020]   - Almost like a,
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.180]   - When you go to judge confidence, don't look at the face.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.900]   Look at the extremities of the body.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:35.780]   - Yeah.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.460]   - That's where the truth comes out.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:38.780]   You see it in body language.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.500]   And the further from the face and chest,
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.900]   the more honest the body becomes.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.480]   Look at the feet and the hands.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.900]   - Well, there were, I mean,
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.020]   - That's when you see if people are nervous or not.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.660]   - He was very relaxed in the extremities, that's true.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.660]   - See, you look more confident in this than anything.
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.060]   What are you thinking about?
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.580]   What's going through your head here?
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.620]   Is this the same stuff?
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.420]   Are you intimidated by the two meat heads,
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.960]   one in a suit and tie?
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.540]   Or are you not thinking about that at all?
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.620]   - I know.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.060]   For me, it's just about, okay,
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.820]   what's the most efficient path to victory
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.080]   against this particular opponent?
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.300]   It's just, okay, I've done my job.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.740]   I've taken them through an extensive fight camp
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.500]   to prepare them for every conceivable situation
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.020]   that they're in.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.620]   I've run an efficient warmup.
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.060]   Their body temperature is perfect.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.260]   The elasticity in the muscles is perfect.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:40.340]   My main role when I corner is I avoid
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.980]   what most people do when they corner,
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.200]   which is to be a cheerleader.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.680]   Most cornermen, they're not cornermen, they're cheerleaders.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.940]   They're there to express some kind of emotional support
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.980]   to their training partners or their student.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.140]   Sometimes they're even worse than cheerleaders.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.860]   They express their own emotional fears
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.960]   as the match goes on.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:07.260]   I always believe that 99.5% of the job of the trainer
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.860]   is done, the coach is done,
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.500]   when the athlete steps their foot on the mat.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.940]   At that point, you shouldn't need me at all.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.900]   Everything I needed to tell you should have been
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.140]   not just told to you, but imprinted into you.
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:25.900]   Remember, there's 15,000 people in that crowd.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.860]   For half of the match, you're not gonna hear a word
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.700]   that I can say.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.020]   There's too much noise.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.260]   But you'll hear my voice inside your head
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:36.100]   because you've heard it so many times
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.300]   over the last 14 weeks.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.300]   You're sick of hearing it at that point.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.420]   And they're programmed, know what to do.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.660]   So I'm usually pretty confident.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:52.300]   I'm also very confident that even in worst case scenarios,
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.220]   they can have effective solutions
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.300]   because they train those worst case scenarios
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.340]   every single day in the gym.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.940]   - And so in part, you're there to have a front row seat
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.100]   to analyze what happened
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.140]   so that you can take that to the next match.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.300]   - The biggest danger an athlete faces is tunnel vision.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.860]   Sometimes they will hit upon a certain move or strategy
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.500]   and just say, "I'm gonna go with this,"
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.620]   when there's much easier alternatives.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.900]   But because they're so focused on the alternative
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.980]   they've chosen, they get this tunnel vision
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.660]   and just focus only on that.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.380]   The most constructive thing the corner man can do
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.500]   is alert them to the presence of time,
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.220]   which is very important in an ADCC match
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.900]   'cause all the scoring is structured by time,
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:39.020]   and to alleviate problems associated with tunnel vision.
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.460]   That, okay, you're doing this,
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.700]   but if you just did this, it'd be so much easier.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.820]   So that's the main goal.
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:50.460]   - So here, this was one of several anticipated matches
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.460]   against, second one against Victor Hugo,
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.180]   which is a very tough opponent.
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.380]   And--
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.620]   - Again, this was a situation where Gordon
[01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:03.060]   was considerably outweighed by his opponent,
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.220]   so the main thing here was efficiency.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.580]   His opponent elected to avoid the standing position
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.060]   by jumping into guard, so now--
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:10.900]   - Close guard, yeah.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.220]   - Gordon would be in top position this time.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.020]   - He has a very good close guard.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.180]   - But unfortunately, Gordon has very good guard passing.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.860]   So he's an excellent guard player, very talented,
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:26.460]   but Gordon is renowned as the eminent guard passer
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.420]   in the world today.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.500]   So it's a tall order to hold Gordon off
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.260]   for a 10-minute match.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.300]   - Is there something you can say about this guard passing?
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.860]   Gordon is making it look very easy.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.180]   It's middle distance guard passing here.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.420]   He eventually passes to mount, I believe,
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.980]   in a very, again--
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.220]   - Why don't you run through the sequence
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.060]   where he gets mounted?
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.660]   There's a couple, I believe he gets mounted twice.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.940]   There's some, back just a little bit further.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.140]   - Yeah.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.620]   So he's trying one arm under--
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.380]   - Yeah, this is a stacking position.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.660]   Now, normally, we always insist on the idea
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.420]   of getting advantageous angle first,
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.980]   controlling the feet and getting angle.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.100]   But there's a height advantage that Victor Hugo has here,
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.780]   and the length of his legs means that he can play
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:16.260]   very, very wide with his legs.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.580]   So getting an advantageous angle might be difficult.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.540]   In these circumstances, it often makes sense
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:21.860]   to go right up the middle.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.260]   Now, Gordon could just go back for legs
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.860]   because the legs, Victor Hugo's legs
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.180]   are so far apart at this point
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.020]   that you could easily isolate a leg and attack that.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:37.420]   But Gordon wanted to show off his passing prowess.
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.260]   Very often, he'll go into a match and just say,
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.140]   "Okay, I'm gonna show this skill."
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:43.860]   And he'll often use it as a demonstration
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.180]   of techniques he teaches in instructional videos.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.300]   So he wanted to show that he could pass to mount readily
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.140]   on a world champion.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.260]   - Like this part here, this little step.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.780]   - Okay, just freeze it right there.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.260]   Go back one step.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:02.020]   Okay, you can clearly see that all of his opponent's
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:06.020]   defensive frames are built on his opponent's left-hand side.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:09.060]   So everything is defense on the left,
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.660]   but you can see this comes at a price
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.460]   and that price is back exposure on the right-hand side.
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.340]   You can literally see his opponent's back on that side.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.780]   So Gordon's whole game is to place sufficient pressure
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.460]   that the opponent overcompensates on the side of pressure
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.460]   just to set up a quick switch across to the other side.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.420]   There's the vulnerability, there's the back exposure.
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.140]   His opponent has to put his back on the ground,
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140]   switch his back.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.140]   That's a world champion right there on bottom
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.540]   who does a good job of recovering from the first danger,
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.380]   but unfortunately Gordon has been here a thousand times
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.100]   and just switches his hips and kicks out.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.100]   - Little step.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.940]   - And so you see there's two changes in direction,
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.700]   left, right, in a very short period of time
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.780]   that people find very, very hard to keep up with.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.260]   Now his opponent builds up to an elbow.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.860]   He's looking to create more and more space from here,
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.300]   but Gordon counters by just stepping over the hips.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.980]   It's just when you feel like every move,
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.540]   he's doing the right things.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.900]   The man on bottom is doing well.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.340]   He's doing the right things,
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.140]   but the other guy's just been here too many times
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.780]   and is just a half second ahead of every decision being made.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.340]   - Going up on the elbow.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:21.380]   Gordon makes it look so easy here.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.980]   It almost seems like Victor's out,
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.300]   but this turning of the hips
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.220]   with the arm over the opponent's back,
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:35.580]   he's able to bring him back down and Gordon takes mount.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.740]   (silence)
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.420]   - Notice how Gordon is never satisfied
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.140]   with the mounted position itself.
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.580]   He's only satisfied with an extended mounted position
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.340]   where the elbow comes up over the shoulder line.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.100]   - Yeah, only then does he show,
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.540]   there's a little bit of relief right there, right?
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.580]   Right?
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.660]   There's a little bit of relief.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.860]   - No, that's the look of a man who's just proved a point.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.780]   - I, this is very Michael Jordan,
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.020]   like sticks his tongue out.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.540]   So yeah, I mean, there's no points at this stage.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.260]   He really is going for submission.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:14.140]   And then this happens again.
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:26.780]   Is this the match that wasn't Gordon's?
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.260]   - This was the only match where Gordon didn't finish
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.820]   his opponent by submission.
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.260]   - Was this very frustrating for him?
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.100]   Was there a--
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.860]   - It's actually interesting that when he came off the mat,
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.220]   he was visibly frustrated.
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:44.980]   He wanted to get a finish.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:49.700]   And I think he was more upset about not finishing
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.100]   Victor Hugo than he was delighted
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.820]   by winning his two gold medals.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:59.500]   So I think that says a lot about the perfectionism
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.380]   of Gordon Ryan.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:04.340]   Most people would be thrilled to beat one of the great
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.620]   grapplers of this generation decisively in this fashion,
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.780]   but he was not happy.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:16.140]   - And so this is Gordon's third match against Sousa,
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.660]   Roosevelt Sousa, another guy who's very big.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.700]   - Yeah, this is different because now we're onto
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.300]   the second day.
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.140]   Your listeners should be aware that the event occurs
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.580]   over a two day period.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.660]   So the previous two matches occurred on Saturday.
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.060]   Now we're into Sunday.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.780]   Now this puts a different context on things.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.460]   If we could just freeze it right there,
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:34.780]   maybe go back one step.
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.060]   Now we're on Sunday morning.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.660]   And the idea is that Gordon will be fighting
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.820]   the biggest fight of his life late that afternoon.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.900]   So now we're into the idea of energy conservation.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.340]   It's okay to have two hard matches on Saturday
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.380]   'cause you get to rest on Saturday night.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.500]   But now Gordon has to beat two people back to back
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.100]   and save energy for the biggest fight of his life
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.260]   on Sunday, late Sunday afternoon.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.860]   So now the emphasis is on a quick win
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:09.540]   and you can see Gordon Ryan certainly delivers on this.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.580]   Now, when you go to entangle your opponent's legs,
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.500]   the basic choice you have is between straight Ashigarami
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.060]   and cross Ashigarami.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.900]   In the last five years, cross Ashigarami has proven
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.780]   to be statistically the more important of the two.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.420]   And as a result, many people have forgotten the value
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.820]   of straight Ashigarami leg based leg locks
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:37.260]   and undervalued them.
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.340]   Gordon has outstanding heel hooks
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.140]   from both straight and cross positions.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:45.620]   And his opponent was probably more concerned
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.180]   about the danger of a cross Ashigarami
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.020]   left the right leg undefended for far too long.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:58.020]   And as a result, Gordon goes into a very classical Ashigarami
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.660]   you would normally expect to see from five or six years ago
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.940]   and gets a very, very quick finish.
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:06.020]   - So lifts his opponent.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.900]   - There's the Ashigarami, the entanglement
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.380]   of one of his opponent's legs with two of his.
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.940]   Now he's got to turn and expose his opponent's heel.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.220]   So there's an initial off balance to the left
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.700]   to get a defensive reaction.
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.860]   The opponent overcompensates, exposes his heel
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.660]   and then there's the submission.
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.780]   There's a danger of a leg being broken here.
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.740]   Gordon has a absolutely ferocious outside heel hook
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:34.260]   until you felt it, it's quite different.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:38.340]   - So the opponent probably before he even felt the heel hook
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.300]   felt the control and that it's screwed.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.140]   - Yeah, it's--
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.580]   - That he's screwed there.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.660]   He doesn't even want to--
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.460]   - When someone who knows what they're doing
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.660]   gets a bite on your leg like that,
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.100]   you feel it deep inside your knee
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.180]   and ankle tendons immediately.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:59.060]   And it's--
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:02.020]   - There's a sense in which you almost tap,
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.300]   he got a couple of taps, almost like as if they're early.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.140]   Because the opponent knows--
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:07.980]   - Yeah, people came up to us,
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:10.140]   obviously this guy tapped early, it's like--
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:10.980]   - No, he knew.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.980]   - He knew that late would be a big problem.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.900]   Got it.
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.780]   So this is within like 30 seconds, within 10 seconds.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.020]   - I think it was within 10 seconds.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.940]   So this was an excellent example of someone saying,
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.780]   "Okay, I'm gonna conserve energy with a short match.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.380]   "I'm not just gonna go down into a neutral position,
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:33.260]   "I'm gonna directly pull into a leg lock attack
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.820]   "from standing position."
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.420]   You don't see that much in heavyweight divisions,
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.540]   that's something you see more in the lightweight divisions.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:43.140]   - So we gotta go to the final match of Gordon's
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.900]   within his division, which I think,
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:51.900]   as opposed to facing Felipe Pena, who lost to Nicky Rod.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.140]   - Nicky Rod had a great match against Felipe Pena
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.300]   and passed Felipe Pena's guard.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.540]   I think only the second person in ADCC competition
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:03.380]   to accomplish that.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.380]   - I believe with a body lock.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.500]   - It started as a body lock,
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.420]   but he converted to half guard, top head and arm,
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.300]   and passed out of half guard, top, chest to chest.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.780]   - I think I listened to Craig Jones sort of interview
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.780]   summarizing what happened in ADCC,
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.100]   and he briefly mentioned that Nicky Rod
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:25.260]   might have the best body lock pass that he's ever felt.
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.100]   So like--
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.540]   - He's very, very good with the body lock.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.220]   - The way to face Nicky Rod is don't let him
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.340]   get the body lock.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.300]   - But there's a problem, if you stand up,
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.380]   he's a good wrestler, so there's a dilemma there.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.980]   Like you have to sit down to guard,
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.660]   but that goes into his body lock.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.060]   But then if you stand up,
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.580]   now you go into his wrestling skill.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.340]   So it's a great dilemma that he has.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.900]   - And that's what,
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:55.500]   in facing Nicky Rod, going Ryan here, chooses to,
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.620]   (laughs)
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.420]   yeah, if you look at the limbs, there's a relaxation there.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.700]   - We should also explain some things here.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.940]   This is a finals match.
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:10.020]   So instead of being 10 minutes long,
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.020]   it's 20 minutes long with the option
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.940]   of a 20 minute overtime.
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:16.580]   So this could potentially be a 40 minute match.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.700]   So you can see why the ADCC people were very concerned
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.500]   about Gordon doing this match,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.780]   because what if this match had gone 40 minutes
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.740]   and then an exhausted Gordon Ryan has to go out
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.980]   to fight Andre Galvan, who's fresh and ready to maul him.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.900]   - And on top of that is two former teammates--
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.500]   - Who know each other's game very well.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.580]   So there was a high likelihood in most people's minds
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.420]   that this would go the distance.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.580]   'Cause when you train with each other for years,
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.260]   every single day in the gym, seven days a week,
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.060]   you get to know each other's tricks.
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.820]   One big problem here for Nicky Rod is that
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:52.340]   his body lock guard passing game,
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.500]   which is his main weapon on the ground
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.420]   was taught to him by us.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:01.220]   So it's not like we're gonna be taken by surprise by it.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:04.180]   So that must've been figuring in his mind.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.180]   - Do you think psychologically for Gordon
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.260]   and psychologically for Nicky Rod, it's tough?
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.620]   So for him with that body lock, for example,
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:15.540]   do you think it's tough for him to know what to do here?
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.500]   - It's tough because he would have remembered
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.660]   the outcome of the training sessions.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:23.340]   It's hard to go up against a guy
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:26.740]   who used to dominate you in training
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:29.300]   and then say, "Okay, I'm gonna beat him in competition."
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.860]   - Can you shut all of that off?
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:32.460]   Because-- - It's tough, man.
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:33.660]   Memory is memory.
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.460]   You can't lie to yourself.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:36.900]   - What do you think about competition?
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:40.140]   Sort of there's been a lot of, Olympics bring this out.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.660]   There's been a lot of big upsets at the Olympics.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:46.260]   There's something where people find something in them.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.620]   I mean, judo is a different sport than grappling.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.260]   - In judo, there's much more room for upset
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:57.140]   because a mistake in judo
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.780]   will have ramifications that will be felt
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.620]   within half a second.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.780]   Like if you take the wrong grip in judo,
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.660]   you can be thrown in half a second and there's no recovery.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.740]   If your two shoulders hit the mat with momentum,
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.780]   it's over, it's done.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:16.900]   In jiu-jitsu, you could, especially in ADCC
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.540]   where there's no points in the first five minutes,
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:21.300]   you could get taken down and mounted by your opponent
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.500]   and still win.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.740]   Like you can recover from a bad start.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:29.460]   In judo, boxing, kickboxing, MMA, you get hit,
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.540]   there's no recovery time.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.820]   You just get swarmed on.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.700]   And jiu-jitsu is a much more forgiving sport
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.300]   where you can make a series of blunders
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.860]   and you just recover from them.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.460]   You don't make a series of blunders in boxing,
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:41.300]   you're unconscious.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.900]   - So there's the blunder case,
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:46.900]   but there's also been just people where it's their day.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.140]   I mean, again, maybe it's romanticizing the notion,
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:53.100]   but there's been some epic performances
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.620]   in Olympic wrestling, in Olympic judo.
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.260]   As an example, Satoshi Ishii, he had a 2008 performance.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.180]   We talked about all Japan and all that kind of stuff,
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:07.180]   but the Olympics, he destroyed everybody out there.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.340]   Everybody on this path to the Olympic gold medal.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.660]   And that's when Teddy Rene was also competing,
[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.100]   he got the bronze.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.980]   So, I mean, that,
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:18.820]   and you could say he was at that time
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.220]   the best in the world also, but he,
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.940]   I mean, some people have a say.
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.860]   - Yeah, but I think it would be very fair to say
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.420]   he was the best in the world.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:28.460]   Think about the people he beat
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.940]   to win three all Japan championships.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.940]   Like he beat Kosei Inoue, he beat Keiji Suzuki,
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.540]   they were Olympic champions.
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:38.500]   Like he was already--
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.940]   - So you don't believe on free will?
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:41.700]   That this is all written--
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:45.180]   - I don't believe that a person can walk on stage
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:47.940]   and be better than what they are supposed to be.
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:50.380]   You have a skill level, it's set in stone.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:51.620]   This is your skill level.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:52.900]   You don't just go on stage
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.540]   and suddenly your skill level gets here.
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.100]   What you do have is a situation
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.980]   where you have a skill level, okay?
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.340]   Another opponent has a higher skill level,
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:04.760]   but he runs into confidence issues.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.500]   So that he only uses a small percentage of his actual skills
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.900]   and then he will fall below someone
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:14.940]   who is technically lower on the skill scale than he is.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.580]   That can happen,
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.740]   but you can't just magically acquire skills--
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:23.500]   - Yeah, but all of us are able to fall in confidence.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.980]   - Yes, so the question becomes who manages that fall best?
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.500]   And that can create upsets, absolutely.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.140]   - So you don't think Gordon could have fallen in confidence
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.620]   against a former teammate
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.940]   when the pressure is so high?
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.940]   - There was just no basis for a fall to occur.
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.520]   - You said he doesn't have confidence issues.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.980]   What do you attribute that to?
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.620]   - That's because he never loses in the gym.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.580]   There's no experience in his head
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.460]   that would make him say, "I shouldn't be this confident."
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:52.860]   - So it's the physical,
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.420]   it's like we talked about mental preparation--
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.260]   - Hey, don't get me wrong.
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:59.100]   If Gordon lost 20 matches in a row,
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.900]   of course his confidence would drop
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.480]   because experience is now,
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.560]   there's gonna be a psychological dissonance
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:10.600]   between his experience, his recent experience,
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.240]   and what he believes.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.600]   Okay, if you believe you're the best in the world,
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:14.840]   you just lost 20 matches,
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.040]   at some point reality's gonna break in.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.400]   But if you're just never losing in competition,
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.240]   dominating people in the gym,
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.580]   then there's nothing in your experience
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.240]   that would shake your confidence.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.560]   - Can I ask you this just in a small tangent?
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.240]   Why is Gordon Ryan so good?
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.960]   So we're looking at,
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.600]   you've trained a lot of special athletes,
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.000]   you're a special human being yourself.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.220]   I could just look at human history.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:44.520]   There's a lot of, not a lot,
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.680]   there's some special humans.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.840]   It seems like Gordon Ryan is one of them.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.120]   - I totally agree with that.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.680]   - Can you try to dissect--
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.840]   - That's what I meant when I said
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.120]   I had many students but only one Gordon Ryan.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.440]   I've taught many, many people,
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.120]   but they don't all have his skill level.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.760]   So there's an obvious elephant in the room here.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.400]   What distinguishes him from other athletes?
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.600]   Great question, I'll try and give an answer.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:14.720]   More than anyone else that I've ever taught,
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.160]   he has a memory for things that were taught to him.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.360]   He has an ability to recall information
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.960]   that is extraordinary compared with other people
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.800]   in the room.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.100]   So that's definitely a big part of it.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.740]   (inhales)
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:35.740]   Secondly, he has a pride in technique and technical prowess
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:41.820]   that will not allow him to settle
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.180]   for anything less than perfection.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:47.660]   And he will hate himself when there is imperfection.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.140]   So there is a love of excellence
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.900]   and a hatred of anything less than excellence.
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:56.640]   (inhales)
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   He has an ability to pull the trigger
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:10.760]   when opportunity arises, which is truly extraordinary.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.080]   Many people know what to do,
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.160]   but when the moment comes, they back off
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.400]   and they'll doubt themselves.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.400]   If Gordon sees the opportunity,
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.960]   the trigger pulls every time.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.360]   - So can I just link on that briefly?
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.520]   There's a few times where he gets
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.840]   a little bit of an advantage
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.840]   and he just chases it to get a big,
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.140]   like with Andre Galvao, you get,
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:39.360]   it's like there's a dance and you get one step ahead
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.960]   and he's able to chase that,
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.560]   get a little glimmer of the back
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.360]   and he's able to chase that all the way to back control.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.280]   So is that kind of the trigger that you're referring to?
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.440]   - Yes, it runs deeper than that too.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.680]   It's the idea that good athletes are greedy athletes.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.600]   When they see a small opportunity,
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.560]   they try and get as big a bite of it as possible.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.600]   So that a mantra that we always have in training,
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.040]   if you can see the back, you can take the back.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.880]   And if Gordon sees an inch of your back,
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.380]   you know that's the direction he's gonna be going.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:15.040]   If your far shoulder is within an inch of the floor,
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.880]   he's gonna be mounting you.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.160]   If your shoulder comes off the floor,
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.120]   he'd be on your back on the other side.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:24.120]   He's a maximalist with opportunity.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.000]   He's not satisfied with,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.280]   oh, let me get a good enough outcome.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.800]   It's like, I want the maximal outcome.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.640]   So when you combine all these things together,
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.600]   an ability to recall information,
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.440]   which is just far superior to anyone else I've ever coached,
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.840]   an ability to work in the training room
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.760]   towards not just good technique, but excellent technique,
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.160]   the confidence to pull the trigger
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.840]   whenever the opportunity arises,
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:00.840]   a maximalist mindset where it's never enough
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.320]   to have a good enough outcome.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.720]   It's always gotta be the best possible outcome.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:11.720]   And the fifth element,
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.720]   which I believe is very, very important,
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.640]   is extraordinary depth in his technical prowess.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:27.400]   In particular, with regards his defensive acumen.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.680]   Everyone looks at Gordon and focuses
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.240]   on his offensive prowess
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.760]   'cause they see him dominate other athletes.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.520]   But what they don't see is what I see every day in the gym,
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:43.360]   where he works from impossibly bad defensive position.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.440]   Someone locked in on a full heel hook on his body,
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.320]   on a full judogitame armbar,
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.600]   in a complete pin mounted with Gordon's two arms
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.680]   stretched out over his head
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.280]   in what looks like a hopeless position.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.960]   And Gordon will work in these positions.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.680]   And of course, because it's such a bad position,
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.080]   sometimes he'll have to tap.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:10.040]   But he just works so relentlessly in these bad positions
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.960]   that when he steps on stage, he's like,
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.680]   if this guy got the worst possible position on me,
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.400]   there's nothing he could do with it.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.160]   And within 30 seconds, I could turn it around on him
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.400]   and win this match.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:30.760]   That gives his game an overall breadth and depth,
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.440]   which is very, very hard to deal with.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.680]   It means there's no obvious weak point
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.480]   where you can just say, okay, I'm gonna attack him here
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.520]   and use this strategy to beat him.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.720]   And that goes back to his confidence.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:53.800]   The reason why most people lack confidence
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.080]   is 'cause they fear bad outcomes.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:00.080]   If you're a strong guard player,
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.480]   you've got an excellent guard,
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.080]   but you're terrified of leg locks
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.720]   and your opponent has strong leg locks,
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.600]   you will shut down your own guard
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:12.040]   and won't play as freely and well as you normally do
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.440]   'cause you're afraid of the leg lock danger.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.280]   You'll pull your feet in,
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.040]   you'll play a very conservative guard game.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:23.760]   But if you had extremely adept leg lock defense,
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.600]   then you just play with all the confidence
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.840]   you normally do from guard position.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.080]   Gordon puts himself in that situation.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.960]   He's so defensively sound
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.040]   that it translates into his offensive confidence.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.520]   - When you talk about memory recall, which is interesting,
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.760]   I can't help but see parallels
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.840]   between him and Magnus Carlsen, who's a chess player,
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.600]   who's the number one in the world,
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.720]   arguably the best ever, certainly the best ever
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.880]   if you just look at absolute numbers.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.500]   The chess has the luxury of having a rating,
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.960]   which you cannot have in jiu-jitsu
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.680]   because it's a game of human chess.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.160]   Chess is just a board game,
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.520]   so you can actually calculate the probability
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.360]   that you could win.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.200]   So he has the highest ELO rating ever,
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.760]   and he's maintained that rating.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.080]   He can, without competing against
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.120]   the number two in the world,
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.040]   he can just prove that he's the number one
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.960]   in the world for many years.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.440]   Anyway, there's certain similarities.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.460]   One is ability to recall.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:31.280]   So memory recall of information is fascinatingly good.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.520]   And the other one is not so much a love for perfection,
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.840]   which is something you mentioned,
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.200]   but the flip side of that,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.560]   which is what you also mentioned,
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.760]   is the hate of imperfection.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.600]   Now, in the case of Magnus,
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.840]   it almost creates a level of anxiety for him
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.780]   that's almost destructive.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.760]   So the thing he seems to hate the most
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.480]   is imperfection against people he knows are worse than him.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.200]   So the thing he loves is competing against people
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.700]   that are close to his skill level,
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:10.000]   or the favorite is people who are,
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.840]   might actually be better than him,
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.520]   especially in certain positions.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.160]   He loves competing against them.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.820]   He hates competing against people that are,
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:23.400]   still, from the perspective of everyone else,
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.080]   what are called super grandmasters,
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.920]   so top three in the world,
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.880]   but he knows he's much better than them.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.380]   And the anxiety of being not perfect against those people,
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:36.340]   that's why he, I don't know if you're paying attention,
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   but he stepped away.
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.600]   He's not gonna defend his world championship.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.160]   Because he hates the anxiety
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.960]   of playing people worse than him.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.240]   - Interesting.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.680]   He figures they would somehow make him look bad, or?
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:52.840]   - No, he just, for him, at least the language he uses,
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.160]   it's just not fun.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.440]   And he likes having fun.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.880]   To him, it was fun to win, no matter the skill level,
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.400]   the world championship the first time.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.160]   But then defending it is a very grueling process.
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.920]   It's, with classical chess, you play these many hour,
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.360]   it could be seven hour long games.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.360]   And on top of that, he really hates the fact that it's only,
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.000]   I forget what it is, but it's single digit number of games.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.840]   He says it's low sample.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.840]   So I can't, I would like to play 20, 30, 40, 50 games
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.160]   if we're gonna do it this way.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.880]   But then they're too long.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.480]   It's gonna take too long.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.600]   So he really emphasizes the fun of it
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.240]   and the clear demonstration of who's the best.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.800]   Now, chess is an interesting game.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.240]   It's probably different than grappling
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.960]   because it's been played for centuries.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.400]   So there's this giant body of people that are playing it.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.320]   Like, there's other Gordon Ryans out there.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.960]   Imagine a world where there's multiple Gordon Ryans
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.800]   or something like that, different dimensions.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.720]   But you have sharks everywhere.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.840]   And so there, there is fun to be had
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.880]   even at the very, very, very, very top.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.080]   But the memory recall is the thing that stands out
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.760]   and the hate of imperfection.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.800]   More intense than anybody else in the game.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.720]   - Fascinating.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.000]   - That takes us back to the final.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.200]   - Ah, yes.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.040]   - So here, Gordon is facing Nicky Rod,
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.800]   former training partner.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:38.560]   And again, the intention here is,
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.240]   this has to be put in the context
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.720]   that Gordon will be fighting
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.240]   the greatest ACC grappler of all time
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.080]   in a few hours after this.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:51.080]   So what we're looking for is a quick resolution.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.920]   Still the shortest possible match.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.760]   Now, there's a complicating factor here.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.080]   Nicky Rod was a wrestler before he was a jiu-jitsu player.
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:08.520]   On paper, the way his route to win is via wrestling.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:14.320]   He's not gonna be able to submit Gordon Ryan
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.360]   and he's not gonna be able to pass his guard.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.880]   So he has to win by wrestling.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:23.600]   In the ADCC finals, you cannot sit to guard.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.240]   So the approach that Gordon used earlier
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.840]   that we saw on video cannot be used in the finals.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.680]   Gordon must wrestle his opponent.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:34.680]   So on the way out,
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:39.880]   Gordon and I were talking
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.920]   and we'd had discussions obviously during the cam,
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.520]   what's the appropriate thing to do here?
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.160]   And there had been some
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:52.200]   matches earlier in the event
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.280]   where it was becoming obvious that stalling
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.840]   was being heavily punished by referees.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:04.600]   So I said to Gordon on the way out,
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:08.120]   just give him your leg, let him take you down.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.400]   Because in the first 10 minutes of the finals,
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.960]   takedowns don't score anything.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.400]   There are no means of scoring the first 10 minutes,
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.480]   but you can't sit to guard.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.840]   That will award you a negative point.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.240]   So I said, just let Nicky Rod take you down.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.600]   And he's like, Nicky Rod's not gonna take the bait.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.920]   And I said, if he doesn't, I'll call him for stalling.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.240]   And so--
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:31.800]   - And then Craig Jones also commented after the fact,
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.000]   is I don't know why Nicky Rod took the bait.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.040]   - So if we see the start of the match,
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.080]   you see Gordon comes out and offers a leg.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.160]   Now it's not that, you know, Nicky Rod is smart.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.400]   He knows what's happening here.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.400]   And what's he gonna do?
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.400]   Stall for 10 minutes
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.760]   and get like five stalling calls put against him?
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.240]   So Gordon gives him the takedown.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.720]   That way they go to the ground immediately with no effort.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:58.480]   And the match now favors Gordon
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.480]   'cause Gordon is significantly more skilled on the ground.
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:06.520]   The question is,
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.760]   how can we make this match as short as possible?
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.120]   And as is so often the case, the answer comes back to legs.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:16.200]   - So for people just listening to this,
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.040]   Gordon's in an open guard
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.920]   and Nicky Rod appears to be trying to keep his hips away
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:21.800]   from Gordon's legs.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.920]   - Yes, the big, now Nicky Rod knows there's a danger here.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.200]   So he's elected to go to his knees
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.560]   that will set up his favorite body lock passes.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.840]   And it will in some ways mitigate
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.480]   some of the dangers associated with leg locks.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.520]   So Gordon's whole thing is,
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.640]   how am I gonna get my body weight underneath him?
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.760]   He has a choice between linear entries
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.640]   where he enters between his opponent's knees
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.720]   and circular entries where he inverts
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.160]   and spins underneath his opponent
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.880]   to get under a center of gravity.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.520]   - Is there a way for somebody to try to get a body lock
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.120]   without giving Gordon an opportunity to get under them?
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.480]   - Well, the body lock is an excellent way
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.400]   to shut down leg lock entries,
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.200]   if you can get to the body lock.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.320]   But you can see Gordon's very, very disciplined
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.640]   with his elbow and knee position.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.560]   Elbows and knees work in a position
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:08.920]   where it's very, very hard for his opponent
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.240]   to access his waist.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:15.040]   That shoulder's always either across the hip
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.400]   or in front of the shoulder.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.320]   Sorry, his knee is either in front of the shoulder
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.440]   or in front of the hip.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.240]   - And we're one minute into the match.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.320]   And just if I were to look at the video player here,
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.360]   it appears that the match is over soon.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.360]   So I guess Nikki Rod is facing this.
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:35.920]   I need to get close in order to do the body lock.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.320]   And the closer you get, the more danger there is
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:45.760]   to let Gordon get under you and get the leg control.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.920]   (silence)
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:33:04.360]   Now they're starting to get close here.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.440]   Gordon's gonna try and get his head underneath his opponent,
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:08.440]   make a circular entry into the legs.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.840]   He's clearing his opponent's head out of the way
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.760]   by faking the arm drag on the far side.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.840]   The first move that he used against his first opponent
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.040]   earlier in the tournament.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.040]   And there's the leg.
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.160]   Spins underneath it.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:23.600]   Goes circular, rotates through,
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:25.720]   gets his body weight underneath his opponent.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.560]   - Okay.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.880]   - And now he's gonna trip him down to the mat.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.880]   - Now, I believe Nikki Rod tries to pull out his foot here.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.960]   And Craig also said that Nikki Rod has gotten used
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.520]   to being able to pull that foot out from anybody.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:43.200]   And that he was very surprised at the grip
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.280]   that Gordon was able to actually hold on.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.320]   So I just wanna comment.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.720]   I'm just parroting commentary.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:54.640]   - If you look at what's happening here.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.680]   - From the internet.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.880]   - If you just freeze it, you'll see that Gordon,
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.640]   like any good leg locker, will always treat
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.480]   his opponent's foot like a knot at the end of the rope.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.600]   Just as you slide down a rope,
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.080]   if there's a knot at the end, your hand will catch.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:13.440]   So too with the human leg.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.600]   When they go to extract by pulling,
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.480]   you just keep your fist as close to your shoulder as possible
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:20.560]   and narrow the gap.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.200]   The foot will always catch.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:23.400]   The failure that many people have
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.560]   is they let their hand drift away from their own shoulder.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.640]   And so there's room for the foot to extract.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.440]   But you'll see Gordon's extremely disciplined
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.640]   with thumb close to his own shoulder,
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:34.080]   which creates a situation that's very, very hard
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.840]   just to simply pull your foot out.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.440]   - You're focusing on the knot of the foot.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.280]   - Yeah, also it's very early in the match.
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.760]   There's very little sweat.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.520]   Both athletes are still pretty dry.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:49.240]   Now Gordon has to climb the leg.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.360]   And now he's already captured his opponent's shoelace.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.800]   There's the heel exposure coming up.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.320]   Nicky Rod already knows things are getting bad.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.320]   And there's the win.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.640]   - Actually, the comment I made, I guess,
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.760]   was from a little bit earlier.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.240]   There was an earlier time
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.560]   where Nicky Rod was trying to pull out the foot
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.480]   and Gordon was able to hold onto the knot,
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.880]   which is interesting.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.600]   - Now that was a brilliant day's work by Gordon Ryan.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.240]   He's had two matches against opponents
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.940]   considerably bigger and stronger than himself.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:23.520]   And the time of the two matches can be measured
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.480]   in I think less than two minutes.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.000]   So he's done what he set out to do.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.320]   No injuries, no exhaustion.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.520]   He's beaten four guys back to back,
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.960]   all of whom are excellent athletes
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.880]   with minimal energy expenditure.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.440]   And he's ready to go on to his super fight.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:44.200]   - So, and that's against one of the greatest,
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.560]   arguably for a long time,
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:49.840]   really, really up there,
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.960]   jujitsu practitioners, competitors,
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.160]   grappling no-gi competitors of all time,
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.000]   which is Andre Gavar.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.480]   - Yes, Andre Gavar is almost certainly at this point
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:01.440]   the greatest ADCC competitor of all time.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.920]   He won more super fights than anyone else by a landslide.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.960]   - So if I may just read a few words
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.240]   you've written on Instagram about this match,
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.720]   about Andre Gavar on greatness.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:15.600]   "How great you become in any given endeavor
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.160]   will always be assessed by the degree of difficulty
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.440]   of the barriers you had to overcome to get to the top.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:23.780]   Just as the lion became king of the jungle,
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:26.100]   not by living among sheep,
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:29.160]   but by dominating a world of elephants, hyenas,
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:32.040]   buffalo, leopards, crocodiles.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.120]   So too, the greatness of an athlete will be determined,
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.720]   not just by his own ability,
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:39.440]   but by the greatness of the athletes he faces.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.760]   Thus, in his quest for greatness,
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.460]   Gordon Ryan owes a debt to the greatness
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.480]   of his toughest opponent, Andre Gavar."
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.540]   And you go on to sing him praises.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:52.160]   So, and that introduces this match.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:54.960]   You know, there was an interesting moment.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.960]   I didn't even listen to the words exchanged,
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.200]   but because I had the great fortune
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.500]   of sitting next to Hodger Gracie,
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:08.960]   there was this fascinating moment before the match.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:11.920]   And I can't believe Gordon is sufficiently relaxed
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.680]   to do this, but he walked up to Hodger Gracie
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.000]   and had a discussion.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   What do you think?
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.640]   You've faced Hodger Gavar before.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.000]   What are your suggestions?
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.520]   And they've talked to back and forth.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.160]   They brainstormed ideas, like minutes before the match.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.440]   And it was just a beautiful moment of like, I don't know,
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.000]   like Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan talking to each other,
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   something like that.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.400]   I mean, I wonder how much brainstorming there really was
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:44.400]   and how much was it just kind of like spiritual inspiration
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.600]   or something like that.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.400]   - Yeah, I think it's more spiritual inspiration.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.240]   He looks up to Hodger as a very close friend
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:55.080]   and mentor of mine.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.200]   So, I always tell my athletes,
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.640]   "Look to Hodger as your example."
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:02.280]   This is a guy who always fought for the finish.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.200]   He tried to express the highest ideal of Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.960]   which is control leading to submission
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.200]   in every match he was ever in.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:11.960]   He even lost matches on tactics against people
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.380]   that he could easily have defeated
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.780]   if he adopted a different tactic.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:19.160]   But he always insisted on victory by submission.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.920]   It defined his career, it made him who he was.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.880]   And I always try to have my athletes emulate him.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.400]   - So, what was the strategy going into this match?
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.240]   What were you thinking?
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.640]   - Okay, for Andre Galvant,
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:36.080]   there's a sense in which Andre Galvant had to fight
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.160]   literally the perfect match to win this.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.280]   Okay, this is a match that's gonna be 20 minutes long
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.600]   and potentially 40 minutes long.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.680]   Andre Galvant cannot win by submission.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.080]   Gordon's submission dominance here is just too great.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.800]   It would be exceedingly difficult
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.080]   for him to win on the ground.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.760]   Gordon's ground positional game is just too advanced.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.860]   And so, for Andre Galvant, he had to win.
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:09.880]   If he was going to win,
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:13.760]   it was going to be in a standing wrestling exchange
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.360]   where most people assessed him
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.260]   as having a measure of superiority over Gordon Ryan.
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:25.720]   The problem is that it's hard to get a win
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   to just keep a potentially 40 minute match on the ground,
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.780]   sorry, off the ground that whole time.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.800]   It's very, very difficult indeed.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.000]   So, he would have had to fight
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.960]   literally the perfect tactical match to make it happen.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.080]   And he would have to do it
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.240]   without getting called for stalling points.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:46.400]   Gordon has the luxury that if at any point
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.360]   they go to the ground, he has complete dominance.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.140]   But Gordon too has a problem
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:54.340]   that he can't pull guard without being penalized.
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:58.640]   And if Andre Galvant can play this tactical game
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.440]   of forcing Gordon to pull guard
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.680]   and then staying at a distance where he doesn't,
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.720]   he's doing enough action not to get called for stalling,
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.460]   but not so much to engage
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.900]   with the dangerous Gordon Ryan on the ground,
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.460]   then it's feasible he could have won.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.640]   But it would have been, as I said,
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.120]   it would have required the most perfect application
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.800]   and integration of technique and tactics
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.920]   that he's capable of.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.620]   - How much intimidation was there?
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:31.680]   Or are these assets already beyond that?
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.380]   - When you say intimidation, be more precise.
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.440]   - Do you think there was some degree,
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.120]   if you were just to empathize with Andre Galvant,
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.240]   do you think there's some degree
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.880]   in which Gordon was in his head?
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.320]   Because of the trash talk leading up to certain events,
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.240]   because of the level of dominance
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.840]   that Gordon has shown in this competition
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.400]   and in the months and years leading up to it.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.360]   Also the fact that Andre Galvant is also a coach
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:03.880]   of a large team, so there's some pressure
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.360]   to demonstrate to the team that the old lion still got it.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.800]   - Yeah, I can't speak for Andre,
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.800]   but I know for Gordon, it's hard to be intimidated
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:19.920]   when you know the other guy has no method of finishing you.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.240]   It just takes so much pressure off.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.400]   When you just go in there saying,
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.760]   there's literally no way this guy can finish me.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.080]   And there's no way this guy can pin and control me.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:35.800]   I can't be finished, I can't be pinned and controlled.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:39.600]   The only way I can lose this
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.240]   is if this guy plays a tactical game.
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.220]   So in his best case scenario,
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:48.960]   I lose by a tactical game.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.520]   But from Andre's perspective, it's like,
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:53.300]   if I make one screw up, this kid could finish me.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:58.000]   You can see which way the intimidation game goes.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.820]   Now, for the start, things get interesting here.
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:04.160]   We've already said, if you could just freeze it right there,
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:07.280]   Andre's only realistic path to victory
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:09.160]   is standing grappling, okay?
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:12.560]   That would require him to take Gordon down
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.160]   presumably multiple times after the first 10 minutes
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.900]   and not be taken down at all by Gordon.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:22.320]   So it's a tall order, it's possible, but difficult.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.840]   And here's where things get interesting.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.240]   I told Gordon before the match,
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.020]   just go out and offer him the leg.
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.560]   Same way you do with Nicky Rod.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.360]   And that's where things get interesting.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.600]   I must say that I loved what Andre Galvan
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600]   did at the start of this match.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.900]   He's a little crazy here.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:42.980]   There was just so much energy in the room at this point
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:44.080]   that his hand finding got--
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:44.920]   - For people just listening,
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.400]   there's a bit of hard slapping.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.240]   - Yeah, that's fine.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.120]   - That should be considered a strike.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:50.960]   - It's fine.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.280]   There was just a lot of electric atmosphere in the room.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:56.240]   So now things settle down a little bit.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:58.860]   But here's where things get interesting.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:03.440]   Andre throws the whole tactical game out the window
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:05.320]   right from the start.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.420]   He goes for the takedown.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:08.080]   Gordon doesn't try to fight the takedown
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.720]   'cause it's in his interests to go to the ground.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.400]   But I love this about Andre.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.500]   He's literally like, "Fuck you, kid.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:18.040]   "Let's see how good your ground game is."
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.680]   So he shoots the takedown.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:22.760]   And Gordon accepts it, obviously,
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.280]   because it's to his advantage to accept it.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.760]   But I love the fact that Andre was like,
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.240]   "I'm not even gonna try and stall this out.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.520]   "I'm just gonna bang, there it is."
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.760]   So he's like, "Okay, let's see what you got, kid.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.720]   "They say you're good on the ground.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.720]   "Let's see what you fucking got."
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:40.120]   And I love that about Andre.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.560]   Unfortunately, he's entered the hornet's nest now.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.280]   - What happened there real quick?
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.400]   'Cause that was very--
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.760]   - Gordon immediately went into ashigurami.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.840]   Not just any ashigurami,
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.120]   but ashigurami where he's holding both legs.
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.880]   - He's in open guard and he's scooted forward.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:57.080]   Oh, wow, that's really nice.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.200]   - So he splits the legs. - Against Andre Galvao's.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:43:59.920]   - Now he dominates the space between the knees.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.360]   So there's a guaranteed straight ashigurami here.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:06.300]   - He split the knees against Andre Galvao,
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.760]   like effortlessly right there.
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:09.960]   Wow.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:13.380]   - So already, Gordon's in his preferred domain now.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.080]   So he's starting to off-balance his opponent.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.560]   He's looking for a reaction to get heel exposure.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.200]   He does get heel exposure.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.400]   Andre does a good job of monitoring the feet
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.340]   to try and reduce the breaking pressure.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:28.680]   But the brute fact is it's in Gordon's realm now.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.740]   This is where he has all the advantage.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:36.740]   So, and the match is gonna be 20 minutes in Gordon's realm.
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.660]   That's gonna be a very, very tall order.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   - Was there a moment here, again, Gordon's on the legs.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.960]   Are you impressed that Andre's able to get out
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:52.800]   from this corner?
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:53.640]   - I would expect this.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.240]   Andre's been preparing for this for two years.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:58.920]   And remember, Andre has gone against
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.600]   some of the greatest leg lockers in grappling before
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.480]   and prevailed.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.400]   So he's not naive.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.560]   He knows how to defend himself.
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:08.680]   The big problem is that he's gonna create
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:12.020]   defensive reactions, which lead into other aspects
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:14.660]   of Gordon's game, in particular, back exposure.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.840]   - So here, Ashi Garami goes to a single leg type
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.680]   of position where Gordon runs to Andre's back.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:29.000]   - Now he has to return him to the mat.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.640]   The most efficient way to do so is always
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.840]   courtesy of foot sweeping.
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:34.080]   So he pulls out a de-ashi hirai from the back
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.540]   to sweep him down to the mat.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:38.040]   And now Gordon's on top.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:41.960]   And this is a serious problem for any grappler in the world.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.120]   Once Gordon gets top position, he's just relentless.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:51.200]   - But just getting Andre Gavar's good,
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.480]   just getting the guard back, all of that, it's great.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.960]   - There's also a sense here in which Gordon
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:59.320]   is pacing it too, just to physically fatigue an opponent.
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:04.600]   - So he's passing the guard, but not rushing it.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.000]   - Now what Gordon's looking for here
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.600]   is complete chest-to-chest contact.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.600]   He's getting very close to it now.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:17.400]   And once he gets chest-to-chest on an opponent
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.120]   in top position, past one of his opponent's knees,
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:21.960]   it's gonna be awfully, awfully difficult
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.320]   for an opponent to recover.
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:29.760]   - What is he waiting for here?
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.240]   Is there pressure here?
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.480]   Over time, he just wears you out.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.240]   - Yeah, it's part of a campaign of attrition,
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:37.720]   of pressure over time.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.840]   Now he's creating a situation where he's either
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:43.600]   gonna get back exposure or mount exposure,
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.320]   and either way is pretty much fatal
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.160]   when you're dealing with Gordon.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.320]   Andre elected to go the route of back exposure.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:59.960]   - Now Gordon got the body triangle, is on his back.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:02.920]   And now it's a--
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.760]   - Now there's one physical problem here,
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.440]   that Andre Gavar has a neck like a bull,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.760]   and he has a very short and very thick neck.
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:14.160]   So penetrating under the chin for a strangle
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.800]   can be a real problem.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:18.160]   He also has extremely well-developed shoulders
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.160]   and upper arms, so when the head comes down
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.360]   and the shoulders go up, there's very little
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:25.560]   real estate to work with, with regards to your strangleholds.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:29.320]   So Gordon in time will trap one of his opponent's arms
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.040]   with his legs in order to take away
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.520]   one of those strong defensive arms.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.640]   There you can see the arm has been trapped,
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:35.480]   and now he can start--
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:36.320]   - Heating the body triangle.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.000]   - Heating towards the strangle.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.960]   - And now here is still difficult.
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.880]   - It's still difficult, but things are looking good.
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:45.200]   There's still considerable amount of time left on the clock.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.880]   Gordon is well ahead on points,
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.800]   so all the pressure, all the tactical pressure
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:49.640]   now is on Andre.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:48:03.680]   You'll see the critical penetration of the jaw.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:06.480]   - With the wrist, yeah, wow, yeah.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.840]   - Now Gordon elects for a one-handed strangle.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:15.560]   - Wow.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.000]   - Andre fought very bravely,
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.920]   but a strangle, it doesn't matter how brave you are.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.280]   - And where does the strangle actually happen
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   in terms of, it felt like the strangle was at the blade
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.320]   of the, it wasn't even fully sunk in.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.720]   So where does, is that like a full,
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.640]   almost like a one-handed choke?
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.320]   - There's a sense in which once you get underneath,
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.680]   you know the inevitable follow-up is coming.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:45.800]   - So it's again, the inevitable,
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.000]   you're feeling the inevitable.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.400]   - It's like a, to go back to your chess analogy,
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.120]   it's like resigning in chess.
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.440]   - Yeah, in chess it's considered almost like impolite
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.960]   to let it run out when you understand,
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.160]   when you understand that death is on the horizon.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.320]   And there's a lot of respect.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.280]   That was the beautiful thing,
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.200]   with all the trash talk and everything like that,
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.480]   Gordon always shows respect.
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.600]   I love that about the drama of combat.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.560]   It's trash talk in the beginning and respect at the end.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.320]   - I think it's, you know, when you feel someone,
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:25.400]   Andre has great skills, and when you grapple someone,
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:27.200]   you feel just how skilled they are.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:32.200]   And whatever issues you had prior to the match evaporate,
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.400]   when you feel, okay, they're just like you,
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:39.560]   they do the same moves and same kind of concepts,
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:43.080]   and you see that there's more that bonds you together
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.080]   than separates you.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.800]   And that's the feeling at the end of most grappling matches.
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.840]   - So if we could talk about Giancarlo,
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.680]   who had an incredible performance.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.480]   And I mean, there's a lot of things we can say,
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.880]   we can probably go through his matches,
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:59.000]   but if we could just talk without that,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.120]   about some of the most impressive things he saw about him.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:05.840]   One of the things I think you mentioned elsewhere in here
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:06.800]   is about confidence.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.080]   So one of the things you saw that could really benefit him
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.320]   as an athlete and competitor is to build up his confidence.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.200]   Is there, can you speak to that?
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.280]   - First of all, I should give you some background.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.280]   Giancarlo Badoni was a strong local black belt in Boston,
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:27.880]   teaching at Benard Faria School.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.560]   When I would film instructional videos,
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:30.840]   I would often talk to him
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:34.040]   and talk to him about his competitions and training.
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:36.200]   And he would do local competitions.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:38.680]   He was trying to go from Gi training,
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:41.480]   which was the majority of his competitive background
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:42.800]   into no Gi.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.280]   And he was struggling in local competitions,
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.840]   especially with things like leg locking,
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:50.000]   where he had no background in leg locking
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.760]   and would often get submitted.
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:55.120]   So as we worked together in instructional videos,
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.320]   we would talk and discuss,
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:00.120]   he would periodically come to the gym in New York City
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.680]   and come into work out with the guys.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:04.400]   And he often struggled in the training room.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.800]   He had no experience with things
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:07.120]   like body lock guard passing.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:10.280]   And this used to mean that he was,
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.720]   many of the training sessions didn't go well for him.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:18.520]   So he was always like a very polite,
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:21.520]   well-spoken young man and worked hard.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.400]   When we went to Puerto Rico
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.200]   and the team ended up drifting apart,
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.240]   when we moved into Austin,
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:38.200]   he said, "Now that many of your athletes have left,
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.440]   "could I come down and train with you guys full time?"
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:42.320]   And I was like, "Yeah, I'd love to."
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:43.560]   I thought it'd be a great training partner
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.040]   for Gordon and Gary.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:48.200]   We didn't really have any training partners at that point.
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:52.040]   And sure enough, he literally just picked up
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.240]   everything he had and moved down to Austin.
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:58.040]   Now, anyone who just moves halfway across the country
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.440]   to begin training, that already gets my respect right there.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.960]   That's a big commitment.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:04.640]   And he began training.
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:08.320]   We put him on a training schedule
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.200]   where first he had to cover up his big weaknesses.
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.840]   He had limited attacks from bottom position.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:18.400]   He had poor leg lock defense,
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.200]   and he was very, very vulnerable
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.120]   to certain kinds of guard passing,
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.840]   which weren't part of his experience.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.760]   - This is all a year out from AGCC.
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.600]   - Yes.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:32.800]   - And we should also maybe give the spoiler,
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:37.520]   which is he wins his division in a dominant fashion.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:40.400]   He also does incredibly well at the absolute.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:43.200]   - It was an amazing thing.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:45.080]   To give you an idea, when he first moved to Austin,
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:48.520]   he competed in a WNO event,
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:51.000]   and I don't think he scored a single point,
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.680]   lost a couple of matches,
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:59.040]   including matches to people who were in this ADCC.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:03.040]   So he came out of that looking very depressed,
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:08.040]   and he lost to Kenan Duarte, he lost to Mason Fowler.
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.640]   So John Cutler always struck me
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.640]   as someone who was positionally sound.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.640]   He had good guard retention, things like this,
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.320]   but he had no offense, he had no leg lock defense,
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:21.640]   and he just wasn't able to assert authority on matches.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.640]   He was a guy who was always gonna be tough to beat
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:26.120]   'cause it's hard to pass his guard, that kind of thing,
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.520]   but he wasn't dangerous.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.480]   - Can I ask you a question on that?
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.320]   - Yeah.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.160]   - 'Cause my interaction with him early on
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:33.000]   when he came to Austin,
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.760]   I remember he interacted with me a bunch on the mat,
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:39.360]   showing me stuff, but I wonder if that kindness
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.000]   is a detriment to the confidence?
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.440]   Is there some connection?
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.880]   - Again, confidence--
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.000]   - Killers can be nice too.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.760]   - Absolutely, confidence comes from skill level,
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:53.760]   and confidence is a much more rational thing
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:56.120]   than most people ascribe it.
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:59.040]   People think of confidence as like this esoteric,
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:02.080]   ethereal element that you either have or you don't,
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.120]   when in fact, confidence is much more a reflection,
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:08.120]   a rational reflection on your past experience.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:10.200]   And if you're successful with your past experience
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:15.200]   and you're expecting to compete in a situation
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.440]   which is similar to your past experience,
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.880]   and that past experience has mostly been successful,
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.240]   you'll be confident.
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:25.240]   Are you pretty confident that the sun will rise tomorrow?
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.160]   Of course you are,
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.840]   because it's done so every time in the past.
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:31.120]   Now, there's no, as people like Hume pointed out,
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.720]   there's no supreme rational reason for believing this,
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:36.680]   but nonetheless, your confidence is high,
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.240]   and it's the same thing in jiu-jitsu.
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.240]   If you're performing well and skills are the reason for that,
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.080]   your confidence will be high in the future,
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.000]   regardless of what your mindset is.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.600]   So it's not a question of this personality
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.360]   does better in competition or that personality.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.840]   Ultimately, it's gonna come down to your skills,
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.320]   and your confidence will be a reflection
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:00.960]   of your accumulation of skills.
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.960]   - So what was his journey like to a person who lost,
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.480]   to a person who dominated the competition?
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.200]   - Yeah, first things first, we had to say,
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:13.680]   okay, you've got an obvious weakness, leg lock defense.
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:17.720]   So every day in the gym, he would be taught,
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.560]   okay, this is where you put your feet.
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.200]   This is where you position your knees.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.360]   You point your knee this way, not this way.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:29.160]   Then he would have to start sparring situations in leg locks
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.880]   and have to work his way out.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:36.040]   Initially, these were like heartbreaking sessions for him.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:40.360]   I mean, I've got to give that kid full credit.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:43.200]   Like he just worked his way through it patiently,
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.920]   dealt with frustration, initial failures,
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:47.960]   and just said, I'm going to get better.
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.040]   - Can we just linger on that?
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:51.600]   So what's the experience of those early training sessions
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.600]   like from an athlete perspective?
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.440]   - It's daunting.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:55.280]   - It's daunting.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.360]   Are you basically dealing with the rational thought
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.560]   that you're not going to ever be good?
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:04.520]   - Yeah, you're wondering, have I even got what it takes?
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:06.320]   Like, you know, think about it.
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:09.680]   He's an established player who's been in IBJF competition.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:12.320]   I believe he's a brown belt world champion in the Gi.
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:16.160]   And suddenly a group of kids
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.480]   that he's never even seen before
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.520]   repeatedly submitting him with leg locks in the gym.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.560]   And he's like, man, this is terrible.
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:26.520]   Like a year from now, I'm supposed to fight ADCC
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.920]   against people like Craig Jones,
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.080]   like some of the best leg lockers in the world.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:33.820]   Like it must've been hard, you know?
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:37.360]   But he just stayed in there
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.880]   and no one worked harder than him.
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:42.720]   He just was in the gym three times a day,
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:44.200]   studying every day.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.860]   And unlike so many other people,
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:47.240]   every time he was shown something,
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:50.600]   he consciously and deliberately tried to enact it,
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.560]   even at the price of initial failure.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.080]   - Do you advise that that's a good way to go?
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.440]   - It's the only way to go.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:01.080]   Like if you can't wrap your head around the idea
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:05.440]   that trying to acquire new skills
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:08.080]   will create a temporary time
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:11.120]   where your effectiveness diminishes
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.760]   as you're trying to bring on new skills,
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:14.160]   you're never gonna make it
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:17.400]   'cause you'll always stay at whatever skill set you are.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.600]   The whole mental trick is to
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:25.360]   imbue this idea of delayed gratification
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:30.880]   that you have to accept that when I bring on new moves,
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.140]   my overall effectiveness will diminish.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:37.520]   But there's the belief that in time,
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.640]   as my skill performance increases,
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.720]   it will increase over time,
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:43.120]   but it will come at the price
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.860]   of initial frustration and failure.
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:50.520]   And Giancarlo made that mental switch
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.520]   early on in his time in Austin.
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:55.280]   And to his credit, just stuck through.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.620]   Within a very short period of time,
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.400]   he became very hard to leg lock.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:01.420]   And even the best leg lockers in the room
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:03.080]   had a hard time with him.
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.560]   And that was the first step in confidence.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.700]   He said, "Okay, I'm not getting finished quickly anymore."
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:10.720]   Then he had to bring in a whole new set
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.000]   of upper body submissions.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.500]   He neglected upper body submissions.
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:17.160]   - When you say upper body submissions,
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.000]   do you mean the arm lock?
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.920]   - Strangleholds, arm locks, things like this.
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:23.240]   And in particular, he put very, very hard work
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.040]   on his strangleholds.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.080]   He had always been someone who was positionally strong.
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.080]   He could get to the back,
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.960]   but he could never finish from the back.
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:31.960]   And then suddenly in the gym,
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:33.520]   he started finishing from the back.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.780]   And then as gym performance
[01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:37.960]   against the lesser students increased,
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:40.120]   then you bump them up against better students.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:42.160]   And then this goes on all the way up
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.600]   to the best guys in the room.
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:48.720]   And in time, in a relatively short period of time,
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:51.660]   there was significant increases in performance
[01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:55.160]   and success begets success.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:56.760]   And this kept going.
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:02.920]   We started to get a hint of his developing confidence
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.120]   in local competitions.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:07.280]   I remember putting, seeing John Carlo compete
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.000]   in a local fight to win competition
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.200]   against a tough Brazilian kid.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.720]   John Carlo just came out,
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:14.380]   dominated and finished with a leg lock.
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:16.400]   Now that was interesting.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.240]   It's like, okay,
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.680]   you're the guy that used to get finished by leg locks,
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.880]   and now you're beating tough opponents with leg locks.
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.960]   And that was an important psychological step
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:27.320]   for John Carlo Badoni.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:32.120]   And with each little step as we went further and further,
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:34.800]   then he got to ADCC trials
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.660]   and had one of the great performances.
[01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:41.140]   I believe he submitted all of his opponents in ADCC trials
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:45.620]   and put on a fantastic display of grappling.
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:49.460]   Shockingly, no one paid attention to it.
[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.260]   They were just like, "Oh yeah, he won."
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:55.820]   And John Carlo flew into ADCC completely under the radar.
[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:56.660]   They just saw him as,
[01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:59.460]   "Oh, he's the guy that won American trials."
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:02.780]   And no one really paid much attention.
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:05.180]   In his first match,
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:08.900]   he took on a great Brazilian champion,
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:12.460]   Izaki, and won in dominant fashion.
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:13.420]   He was about to strangle him
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:15.580]   with just a few seconds left on the clock.
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:17.260]   And I remember John Carlo being furious
[02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:18.460]   at the end of the match,
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:22.140]   thinking like, "I was so close to finishing."
[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.620]   He wanted a perfect finish.
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:26.180]   - Up on points, six to nothing.
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:27.020]   - Yeah.
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.420]   - And still chasing.
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:29.260]   - Still chasing.
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:30.980]   I mean, he could have just coasted at this point,
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:33.480]   but he wanted to finish every one of his opponents.
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:36.260]   And he got very, very close, but not quite there.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:39.820]   And then in his next match,
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:42.260]   he had to take on the defending gold medalist
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:45.740]   from the previous ADCC.
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:46.700]   - Yeah, Mateo Diniz.
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:48.860]   - This was the guy who was the favorite to win.
[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:51.580]   So you have a relatively unknown John Carlo
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:54.140]   fighting the man who defeated Craig Jones
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:56.080]   in the previous ADCC.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:01.860]   - Do you remember what stood out to you about this match?
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:03.180]   Mateo Diniz is good wrestling,
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:04.020]   he's good at everything.
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:04.840]   - Yes.
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.680]   - He's got all the wrong ground.
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:07.680]   - He's got, by judicial standards,
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:08.820]   he's a very strong wrestler.
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:11.140]   So our intention was to match his wrestling
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:14.620]   with John Carlo's judo skills.
[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:19.620]   So you will see, if we could perhaps go back,
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:24.380]   you'll see the first takedown.
[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:31.620]   - Arm drag.
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:33.660]   - And took him down with a simple drag and pick.
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:36.360]   So that was John Carlo's first takedown,
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:37.860]   that was more wrestling oriented,
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:39.260]   and good for his confidence to see
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:42.060]   that he could score a nice takedown.
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:46.180]   But Mateo Diniz is very, very good at standing up
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:47.100]   from bottom position.
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:48.780]   If we just go back just a step.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:50.580]   Okay, now here we have something interesting.
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:52.280]   Mateo comes up from bottom,
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.460]   seizes a leg and John Carlo defends the wrestling move
[02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:56.660]   and then goes immediately into-
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:57.500]   - With a foot.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:01.260]   - It's kind of a mix of Sasai and Diyashi Hirai.
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:03.660]   - Wow, that was beautiful, I didn't even notice that.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:05.420]   That's really nice, look at that.
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:13.140]   From defending a single, threatening a guillotine.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:17.020]   - One of the big themes of our ADCC camp
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:18.820]   was that most of our opponents now
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.660]   are getting very strong in hand fighting.
[02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:21.500]   - Look at that.
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.900]   - But they are not strong in foot fighting.
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:28.140]   And so we put a very heavy emphasis on foot sweeping attacks.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:30.660]   You remember Gordon Ryan took down Andre Galvant
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:31.580]   with a foot sweep.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:35.140]   And here you have John Carlo using the same technique,
[02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:37.180]   not from the back, but from the front.
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:38.340]   - And an overhook.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:41.200]   - Left hand post.
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:44.540]   Catches the foot midair.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.700]   - Look at.
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:48.180]   - And that's just a beautiful, beautiful takedown.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:49.480]   - That's beautiful Judo.
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:52.820]   And then-
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:55.540]   - And then later in the match, you'll use a Kusarigake,
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:59.740]   another classical Judo takedown to get top position.
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:04.340]   - Now at one point, John Carlo was in trouble.
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.900]   He got his back exposed.
[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:09.380]   - With this situation.
[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:10.220]   - Good.
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:14.620]   - Double leg to-
[02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:15.580]   - To a knee pick.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:16.720]   - Knee pick.
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:20.000]   - So he has to expose his back in order to avoid
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.780]   giving up takedown points.
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:24.180]   But here's a defensive training that we work on
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.620]   is coming through.
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:28.860]   He's defensively sound, shuts out the hook,
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:29.960]   prevents the score,
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:33.260]   keeps his body at the right angle
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.900]   to prevent a power half Nelson.
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:41.020]   Staying calm.
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:43.900]   Now he's got to turn this around.
[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:47.500]   It's one of the hardest things to do in grappling.
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:50.860]   - How dangerous is it to put your,
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:53.940]   in this position to put your hands on the ground?
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:56.340]   - It's ordinarily, it could be dangerous
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:58.180]   because your opponent could switch to an armbar.
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:00.060]   Whoops, and there's the body lock.
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:01.980]   Now there's some controversy here,
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:03.700]   but you can clearly see it.
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.860]   The hands were locked,
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:07.500]   so it shouldn't really be as controversial
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:08.460]   as people are saying.
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:11.060]   Now watch for the right leg kosori gake here.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:14.580]   Pulls in the hips, exposes the leg, boom, and down.
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:16.100]   Beautiful kosori gake.
[02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:24.260]   - Also probably a lesson that
[02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:28.460]   complaining to a ref does not protect you
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.180]   from a good takedown.
[02:04:30.180 --> 02:04:32.460]   - Yeah, that's why they're saying combat sports,
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:33.980]   defend yourself at all times.
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:38.900]   But now the great advantage of judo takedowns
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.220]   over wrestling leg tackles
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:43.020]   is they confer upper body connection after the takedown,
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:45.500]   which is very, very important for ADCC.
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:47.980]   That's why we put such a heavy emphasis on them.
[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:52.340]   And now Giancarlo is absolutely in the driver's seat.
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:54.300]   He just scored four points for that takedown,
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:56.300]   so he's well ahead at this point.
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:58.100]   Against the established favorite
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:00.420]   for the entire weight division.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:03.260]   So now Mateus Denis has to start taking some risks.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:05.500]   He's staring down the barrel of defeat,
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:07.260]   and there's not that much time left.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:09.420]   And that's what's gonna set up the pressure.
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:10.660]   Now it's tactical pressure.
[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:12.980]   It's not physical pressure, it's tactical.
[02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:14.460]   Mateus has to turn away,
[02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:17.300]   and that's gonna create back exposure.
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:20.340]   The most dangerous kind of exposure in ADCC.
[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:21.900]   Oh, there it is.
[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:24.940]   Mount to back.
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:30.700]   And Giancarlo capitalizes.
[02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:35.100]   Mateus is smart, he's keeping on his side
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:38.300]   so that less than 75% of his back is on the floor
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:40.420]   to deny the mount points.
[02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:41.940]   But that comes at a price,
[02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:43.820]   and that price is back exposure.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:46.020]   So the thing we talked about with Gordon,
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:50.300]   the circumstance of fate,
[02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:53.460]   which is he has a lot of grueling tough matches,
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:55.260]   and still chooses to do absolute.
[02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:58.540]   And he seems to just power through all of it.
[02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:04.340]   How much of the calculation is how to survive the cardio,
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:07.020]   the grueling cardio aspect of all of this?
[02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:09.460]   - It's a great question, and the truth of the matter is
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:13.660]   you can't afford to pace yourself.
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:16.060]   Because if you say,
[02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:18.860]   "I'm gonna hold myself back for this match,"
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:19.980]   in expectation of the others,
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.900]   you could end up losing your first match.
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:23.540]   - So he didn't pace himself--
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:25.460]   - At all. - For any of the matches.
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:27.540]   - You have to just be in good shape,
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:28.860]   and that's what the camp is for.
[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:31.140]   - Is someone mental or no?
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:32.580]   - No, it's mostly physical.
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:34.940]   That's what the camp is for.
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:37.140]   Like he's felt more pressure in the training room
[02:06:37.140 --> 02:06:38.940]   than he felt in any of his matches.
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:43.260]   - But still sort of attacking.
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:44.260]   Look at this.
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:46.380]   - That was a beautiful transition.
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.720]   - From back, or from whatever the heck that position was,
[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:55.460]   right, from looking for the back, transitioning here.
[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:57.220]   What the heck is this transition?
[02:06:57.220 --> 02:07:00.020]   - So Mateus is engaging in a very good tactic,
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:01.900]   which is to get most of his back off the ground
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:03.380]   to deny the mount points.
[02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:06.300]   So as back exposure starts, okay, he turns in--
[02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.220]   - Threatening an arm lock.
[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:09.060]   - Yeah, but you can see what's happening here.
[02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:10.220]   As the left foot goes under,
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:12.460]   it's gonna create a beautiful triangle entry.
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:16.940]   Right foot penetrates through underneath the neck,
[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:19.540]   and now he's locking a triangle, a sankaku,
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:23.260]   but not just any triangle, a triangle with the figure four
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:24.820]   locked on the back of the opponent's head,
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:27.140]   which makes any kind of stacking defense
[02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:28.100]   very, very difficult.
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:30.540]   It makes it very, very hard for an opponent to pull away,
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:33.060]   and creates a much tighter strangle than average.
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:37.120]   And as a result, it's a quick submission.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.380]   - Beautifully done.
[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:41.380]   Still chasing the submission.
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:42.420]   - Yes.
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:44.060]   - With a minute left up on points.
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:45.680]   - Against the former champion.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.620]   - Against the former champion.
[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.460]   That's match number two.
[02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:52.180]   Now, that's the first day, that's Saturday.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:55.020]   So John Culler goes to sleep that night thinking,
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:57.780]   okay, I just beat a world champion in my first match
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:07:58.940]   and almost submitted him,
[02:07:58.940 --> 02:08:01.200]   and I just submitted the defending champion.
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:03.020]   So of course he wakes up on Sunday morning
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:04.500]   feeling pretty damn good.
[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.200]   Now, there's an interesting twist here.
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:10.140]   His opponent is a talented young Irishman
[02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:12.120]   who won European trials, I believe,
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.060]   almost entirely with leg locks,
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:16.380]   and almost all of his major attacks in the tournament
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:17.440]   so far have been leg locks.
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.300]   Now, bear in mind that a year ago,
[02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.740]   John Culler was losing to local blue belt competitors
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:22.940]   via leg lock.
[02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:25.100]   So in my mind, I'm thinking, okay,
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:26.540]   how's he gonna handle this?
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:28.740]   Will the leg lock training kick in?
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:30.060]   And you'll see the result.
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:40.700]   John Culler is on top, passing an open guard.
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:41.540]   - So you can see--
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:43.660]   - Keeping his legs away from any attacks.
[02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:44.500]   - Yes.
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.020]   His opponent, Owen, from Ireland,
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:47.580]   is employing the same tactics
[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:50.380]   that we made famous years ago,
[02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:51.860]   the idea of sitting to butterfly guard
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.640]   and looking to entangle the legs.
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:56.180]   He's kind of playing that game.
[02:08:56.180 --> 02:08:57.820]   So John Culler's obviously used to this
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:08:59.560]   from training in the gym.
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:02.140]   So he's doing a good job of preventing entanglement,
[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:04.060]   controlling his opponent's shoelaces,
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:05.140]   and moving out to an angle
[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:07.100]   which limits his opponent's entry options.
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:09.860]   - So hands on the shoelaces and angles
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:12.700]   is a good defense here.
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:14.340]   - It's an initial defense.
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:15.420]   Now, his opponent wants to get
[02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:17.060]   underneath the center of gravity.
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:21.180]   So John Culler wants to get outside the line of his legs.
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:23.420]   At some point, your opponent's going to entangle.
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:24.820]   If he's determined to entangle,
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:26.520]   at some point it's going to happen.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:30.180]   So John Culler decides, okay, let's let it happen,
[02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:31.420]   and let's see where his feet go,
[02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:33.940]   and let's see how disciplined he is with his feet.
[02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:38.540]   And the opponent's inverted.
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:43.420]   Here, he does a good job getting behind John Culler's knee.
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:48.060]   So now they're fully locked in.
[02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:51.020]   So John Culler moves away to protect the heel,
[02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:53.540]   rotates out, controls his shoelace.
[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:56.260]   Now, at this point, the Irishman's starting to lose
[02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:59.140]   discipline with his own foot position.
[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:01.540]   He's so focused on his own attack
[02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:03.780]   that he's starting to get a little sloppy
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:05.260]   with his own foot position.
[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:07.860]   He's assuming, oh, I'm the guy who's attacking,
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:10.940]   so my opponent will be afraid of my leg locks,
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:14.660]   and is starting to make some small tactical errors
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.580]   that John Culler will be able to take advantage of.
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:19.420]   - So he's threatening the sort of the north-south passer.
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:26.060]   - Yeah, he's not putting too much pressure on the pass,
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:27.900]   'cause we're still pretty early in the match,
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.700]   and he's not ready to score yet.
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:32.860]   So here again, he turns away his heel.
[02:10:32.860 --> 02:10:35.860]   Now his opponent's starting to get more and more cavalier
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:37.620]   with his foot positioning,
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:40.880]   to a point where now it's just downright sloppy.
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:45.260]   So John Culler sees it, identifies it,
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:49.400]   locks up a wrist-to-wrist toehold, and breaks his foot.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:58.300]   - Where's the, dumb question, where's the control here?
[02:10:58.300 --> 02:10:59.260]   How is he?
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:01.500]   - The control comes from his opponent.
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:03.980]   The entanglement is his opponent's.
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:04.900]   - Ah.
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:07.820]   - His opponent is holding his own body in place
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:09.100]   with his own legs.
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:12.320]   So he's the root of his own problem here.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.440]   - So he got sloppy, well done, well done.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:19.440]   And a little smile from John Culler, that's very nice.
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.600]   - The reason for that smile, you can probably guess,
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:26.600]   is because a year ago, this would have been a disaster.
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.560]   And now instead, it's a guaranteed ticket to the finals
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:32.320]   in either a gold or a silver medal.
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:35.160]   And so you can see in that compressed moment,
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.400]   that's the look of a man who's made,
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.840]   who's just recognized just how much progress he's made,
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:43.600]   and what was once a weakness in roughly 10 months
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:45.120]   was the time it took.
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:50.120]   - And so he faces Lucas Hulk Barbosa in the final here.
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:52.680]   - Now these two have a history.
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:56.480]   Hulk has beaten John Culler many times.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.520]   And so for John Culler, it's a question of,
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:03.200]   okay, here I'm matched up against a guy
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.300]   who's repeatedly beaten me.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:09.280]   How am I gonna turn this around now?
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:13.600]   And in terms of, we talked earlier about confidence.
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:15.840]   If confidence was just a mental thing,
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.960]   John Culler never would have won this fight.
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:22.080]   When you've lost all those times to an athlete,
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:25.400]   words aren't gonna change anything.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.120]   But you can see right from the start,
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:28.400]   when they get into the hand fight,
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:31.440]   John Culler is much more tactically adept
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:32.440]   with his hand fighting.
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:35.040]   He's doing a good job of controlling his opponent's hands,
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:38.440]   preventing any kind of prolonged pressure on the head.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.160]   And Hulk gets a sense here in which he realized
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:44.060]   he's fighting a very different person.
[02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:49.680]   - And this goes a long time.
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:54.960]   Again, another super grueling match.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:59.960]   Wrestling that eventually leads to a back take here,
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:04.920]   back triangle, body triangle, I apologize.
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:12.480]   Here you can see the same tactics utilized by Gordon Ryan.
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.840]   Back control based around the body triangle.
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:18.400]   Many attempts to try and trap his opponent's arm
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:20.560]   and take away those defensive arms.
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:22.120]   The main difference here is, again,
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:24.880]   you have an athlete with a very powerful, compact neck,
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:27.200]   so neck penetration is difficult.
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:31.000]   And so John Culler will switch to a palm-to-palm strangle
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000]   instead of the conventional figure four.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:39.480]   And now there's eight minutes left,
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:42.640]   so all the time in the world.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:45.760]   Is it only just a matter of time at this point
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.040]   in situations like this?
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:50.440]   - Yeah, John Culler has a massive tactical lead in points.
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:52.460]   There's literally no way he could lose this match
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:54.040]   at this point.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:57.120]   Even if his opponent did get out of here and take him down,
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:59.280]   John Culler would still be ahead on points.
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:04.960]   So this question, the question now is not whether
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.440]   John Culler will get the gold medal,
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.960]   but whether John Culler will get it by submission.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:11.680]   And there it is, there's the penetration of the neck.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:13.440]   And he can't get the figure four,
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.160]   so he opts for palm-to-palm instead,
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:16.520]   and there's the submission.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:23.520]   Now-- - What a journey.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.720]   What a-- - John Culler's
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:26.360]   a relatively unemotional man,
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:28.760]   but you can see there's emotion.
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.320]   That's not fake, that's genuine.
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:32.420]   And that's the emotions of a man who,
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:35.520]   10 months ago, couldn't have done that.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:38.520]   And then 10 months later, by dint of his own hard work
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:43.520]   and dedication and his ability to actively attack
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.760]   his weaknesses and turn them into strengths,
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:51.760]   and then develop an ability to finish,
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:54.940]   that was a truly, truly remarkable achievement.
[02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:58.480]   - Let me ask you about Gary Tonin.
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:05.200]   So he is one of the, at least in my opinion,
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.560]   greatest submission grapplers of all time.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.520]   There's a lot of components to that.
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:12.240]   But he lost in his first match.
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:13.920]   - Not only did Gary lose,
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.440]   he lost to the bottom seed of his division.
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.040]   And that in itself says something pretty remarkable
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:21.800]   about what's happening in ADCC,
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:26.240]   how there's a sense in which the days of
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:30.920]   the invited athletes being far superior
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:32.720]   to the trials winners are over.
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:36.720]   It was a clear signal that anyone who makes it to ADCC
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:38.320]   can beat the best people.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:43.320]   Sam McNally is a very talented submission grappler
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:44.160]   from Ireland.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:46.680]   He specializes mostly in armbars,
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:48.400]   but he has a good positional game as well.
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.840]   Has a very modern look to his jiu-jitsu.
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:55.960]   And he did a fantastic job against Gary Tonin.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:16:01.060]   I think tactically, Gary perhaps got a little far away
[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:05.520]   from his true nature in grappling,
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.840]   which is relentless submission attack.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.440]   And perhaps I should be given blame for this
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:13.880]   because I put such a heavy emphasis
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:18.320]   on the training camp overall on positional pressure.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:20.640]   And I feel that worked very well for all of the athletes
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:21.800]   except Gary Tonin.
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:26.000]   - Interesting, so you have to acknowledge
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.720]   the nature of the athlete's part.
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:31.180]   And I think I was coaching so hard to the new people
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:33.220]   in the room on positional pressure
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:37.540]   that I neglected Gary's innate ability to,
[02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:40.780]   the fact that he does best when he attacks exclusively
[02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:42.020]   by submission.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:45.020]   So I think if anyone should get blamed for the failure here,
[02:16:45.020 --> 02:16:46.660]   it should be me.
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:49.960]   - There's another comment as maybe I'm over,
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:57.160]   overvaluing the sort of just the physical aspect of this,
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:00.340]   but it seemed like Gary looks skinny.
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:02.820]   Is the weight cut difficult?
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:07.020]   - This is the first time he ever went down to the 66 kilos.
[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:10.140]   So it wasn't critical.
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:12.100]   There's other guys who are bigger than him
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:13.100]   who made the weight.
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:15.900]   - But the weight cut, if you can just comment on,
[02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:19.220]   is that, does that ever play a part in the athletes,
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:22.940]   the physical and the mental aspect of the weight cut?
[02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:26.020]   It is a thing, wrestling, that could break
[02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:27.640]   given some of the toughest minds.
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:29.960]   - Yeah, but no, it wasn't a weight cut
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:31.860]   that would break someone like Gary Turner.
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:34.160]   And it was, it's more physical.
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:36.520]   You train lighter and weaker.
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:39.280]   You tend to get injured more in camp 'cause you're lighter.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:42.840]   We have a team now after the breakout
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:46.760]   that's mostly comprised of people over 215 pounds.
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:50.440]   So there's very few small people left in the gym.
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:54.280]   Most of the smaller athletes went to B team.
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:57.220]   So Gary's been struggling a little bit
[02:17:57.220 --> 02:17:58.760]   with training partners.
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:04.160]   But here I think the chief problem was that
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.400]   Gary focused perhaps a little too much
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:09.560]   on the positional tactical game
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:11.720]   and got away from his true gift,
[02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:15.840]   which is relentless hunting for submissions.
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:18.080]   And as I said, I think the person to blame for that is me
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:20.400]   because I had to put so much emphasis
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:24.440]   on the positional game for the developing athletes
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:26.540]   that I didn't pay enough attention
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:28.960]   to Gary's unique attributes.
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.720]   - So this, I mentioned I posted some stuff on Reddit.
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:33.520]   So there's a relevant question here.
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:38.000]   Somebody on Reddit asked, Gordon has said,
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:39.880]   and perhaps you have said as well,
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.240]   that there are two types of jiu-jitsu practitioners,
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:46.640]   ones who move themselves around like Marcel Garcia
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:49.480]   and ones that control the motion of their opponents
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:50.560]   like Gordon.
[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:54.040]   What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:57.480]   And how do those different approaches apply
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:59.600]   depending on which weight class you're in?
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:01.520]   - That's a great set of questions.
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:06.080]   Yes, I'm the person who promulgates this idea
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:08.280]   that there's two broad ways you can go in jiu-jitsu.
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:13.280]   You can either focus on promoting your own movement
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:15.540]   to create opportunity
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:18.060]   or by restricting the other person's movement.
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.700]   If you're a slower, less athletic opponent,
[02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:26.080]   then you should definitely focus on the idea
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:27.960]   of restricting the other fellow's movement.
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:31.760]   That's how slow, unathletic people win in jiu-jitsu.
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:35.400]   If you're quick with the ability to change direction,
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.040]   stand up quickly, go down quickly,
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:41.380]   and move like a leopard,
[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:45.200]   then you're almost always better off generating movement
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:48.300]   in order to create opportunity.
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:51.560]   So one is based more on movement as the source
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:54.120]   of opportunity, one is based more upon pressure
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:56.240]   as the source of opportunity.
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.000]   So you'll get someone like Gary Tonin
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.600]   or the Rua Tolo brothers.
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:01.320]   Their game is based around the idea
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:05.340]   of promoting their own movement to create opportunity.
[02:20:05.340 --> 02:20:07.280]   Whereas someone like Gordon Ryan or Hodri Gracie
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.880]   is about restricting movement
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:13.200]   and using that pressure to create reactive opportunity.
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:15.760]   Those are the two paths you can take in jiu-jitsu.
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:18.580]   Because our team now has become mostly associated
[02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:19.960]   with people over 200 pounds,
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.220]   and because most of them were beginners,
[02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:24.020]   I took the more high percentage approach of,
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:28.020]   okay, let's focus primarily on controlling
[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:29.420]   the other fellow's movement.
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:32.860]   But Gary's a unique individual,
[02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:34.220]   and I feel like I let him down
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:37.820]   by not giving him special attention
[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:40.780]   in regards to what he does.
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:42.220]   - The fact that you've mentioned this now
[02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:45.500]   like four times in the span of a few minutes,
[02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:47.160]   just, I love that,
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:49.520]   that all of this stuff weighs so heavy on you.
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:52.760]   And he is a truly special person,
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:55.080]   and it is truly interesting to see
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:57.480]   what is the nature of a particular athlete
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:00.560]   that if you highlight makes them shine.
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:03.560]   Let's go to the part where Gary actually loses the match.
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:06.160]   Okay, so the match is pretty innocuous at this point.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:08.960]   The guy does a good job of turning into the arm,
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:13.960]   and Gary gets caught reaching from the knees.
[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:15.680]   Okay, that's always a mistake.
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:17.240]   And the guy does, I think,
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:19.480]   does a great job capitalizing on it.
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:21.600]   Now, there's limited time left on the clock.
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:23.920]   This guy realizes, oh, this is my opportunity.
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:25.680]   He's got good flexibility, and he gets the hook.
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:27.500]   So if he just frees it right there.
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:29.400]   So there's a minute and a half left,
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:32.640]   and typically in ADCC, if you get the bag,
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:36.160]   you score three points, so this is a huge score.
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:41.000]   For Gary to win here, it's gotta be by submission, okay?
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.320]   So Gary's made one mistake.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:47.280]   Now, this talented young fellow from Ireland
[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:49.080]   does a great job, not only of getting the bag,
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:51.000]   but he really attacks well from the bag.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000]   And let's look at the depth
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.040]   of Gary Tonin's defensive acumen here.
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:57.000]   - And we should say, leading up to this,
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.440]   his defense is incredible.
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:21:59.260]   - Yes.
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:00.680]   - He keeps escaping every position.
[02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:02.820]   - Our nickname for Gary is the Slippery Salmon,
[02:22:02.820 --> 02:22:04.780]   because it's like trying to hold a goddamn salmon
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:06.960]   on the riverbank, trying to hold onto this kid.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:08.260]   So he gets into a position
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.960]   which looks absolutely hopeless here.
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:10.780]   It gets worse.
[02:22:10.780 --> 02:22:12.200]   This is already bad.
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:16.040]   But-- - It's one of the most fun things
[02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:18.560]   to watch about Gary is the skill and the escapes.
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:20.040]   It's incredible.
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:21.560]   It's beautiful to watch.
[02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:23.200]   - So the guy has an excellent opportunity
[02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:25.000]   to transition off here into a rear triangle,
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.040]   which is one of the hardest things
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.480]   in the world to get out of.
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:30.480]   And from here, if this was anyone but Gary Tonin,
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:32.280]   I think it would have been curtains.
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:36.520]   But you see, Gary just extends, keeps his arm,
[02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:38.480]   but just the right angle to pop out and gets out.
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:40.520]   So now Gary's like, oh, crap,
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:42.280]   I'm gonna lose to this fucking guy.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:43.800]   So he's got a minute left to do something.
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:45.560]   So he goes back into his submission mode.
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.720]   He goes back to who Gary Tonin is
[02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:51.040]   and immediately goes into leg lock action.
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:56.040]   Now, the young man from Ireland realizes,
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:59.360]   hey, I'm gonna win this match against the number one seed.
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:01.060]   So Gary goes into the legs,
[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:05.360]   gets to one of his favorite techniques, the heel hook.
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:09.040]   Now Gary has a brutal heel hook as heck
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:12.080]   and gets real pressure on the kid's leg.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:15.800]   - Oh, I can't, oh, that's hard to watch.
[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:17.840]   - Yeah, but to his credit, the kid is smart.
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:22.240]   He's like, you know what, let me take some pain.
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:24.160]   - Is there a weakness to that?
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.560]   Like, where he turned his hips.
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:28.120]   - Yeah, it's unclear from the video
[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:31.600]   whether Gary's arm slipped up.
[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:33.360]   There's considerable breaking pressure.
[02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.080]   - Oh, it slipped, I see.
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:35.920]   - Yeah, it's unclear.
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:36.760]   - Even before the slip.
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:41.480]   - Sometimes the heel can slip because something's popped.
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:43.240]   So it's unclear what happened there.
[02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:45.200]   There seems to be a reaction from the part of the opponent.
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.920]   Like, it definitely did some damage.
[02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.640]   So Gary goes back for a second one.
[02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:51.080]   - Oh, no.
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:53.560]   - And again, you get that same kind of pressure.
[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:54.840]   - Oh, no.
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:55.680]   - Oh, right.
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:58.160]   - But I like the Irish kid's reaction though.
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:00.020]   He's just like, you know what, let me eat this
[02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:01.240]   'cause I'm gonna win this match
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:03.040]   and I'm gonna be a legend for beating Gary Tonin.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:05.800]   So I admired his internal fortitude.
[02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:08.800]   And, but now Gary knows he's lost it.
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:12.060]   So there's a sense there in which you see
[02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:14.720]   how close it gets in these situations,
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:16.520]   how little there is between winner and loser.
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:20.560]   And sometimes you just get these heartbreaking situations
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:23.120]   where someone who ordinarily you would probably
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:26.300]   do very well against and you make one mistake
[02:24:26.300 --> 02:24:30.160]   and it's an unrewarding, uncompromising sport.
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:31.440]   One mistake can be fatal.
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:34.000]   - In class, you talked about escapes for arm locks
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.580]   and it applies here as well.
[02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:38.200]   So you were teaching arm lock escapes
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:41.200]   and I think choke escapes.
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:45.320]   And the question came up of when should an athlete not tap
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:47.120]   and risk their arm being broken.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:50.360]   And you quoted George Patton as of course you would,
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:53.120]   that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:56.560]   He won it by making some other bastard die for his country.
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:58.320]   So what's your view on when to tap
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.560]   and when not to tap in competition?
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:01.780]   - First off, in training,
[02:25:01.780 --> 02:25:04.480]   you should be tapping very early
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.400]   because you're not getting paid to fight in the gym.
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:09.840]   You're getting paid to fight on stage.
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.560]   So be a professional in the gym, tap early, tap fast.
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.960]   That way you'll last a lot longer.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.820]   In competition, things are a little different.
[02:25:18.820 --> 02:25:21.520]   We also have to specify what is the situation.
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:24.000]   Okay, if you're in the first round of ADCC,
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.760]   your first match, you get caught,
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:29.000]   I would always expect my students to tap
[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:33.300]   because if you get your leg broken
[02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:35.380]   or your arm broken in the first round,
[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:37.500]   you still got three more matches before you get to the final.
[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:39.800]   - There is a escape clause there
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:42.180]   is if you're a guy from Ireland
[02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:44.100]   and you're fighting the number one seed.
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:46.540]   - There is always an escape clause, yeah.
[02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:47.900]   - Like let it snap.
[02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:48.940]   - Yeah, let it go.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.500]   But--
[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:51.780]   - Your students, yes.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:53.700]   - Yeah, I would expect them to tap.
[02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:57.460]   I also think that if you're in a stranglehold,
[02:25:57.460 --> 02:25:59.940]   it doesn't make a lot of sense in not tapping
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:01.600]   'cause you're gonna pass out.
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.520]   It's like you said in chess,
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:09.300]   it's kind of impolite to make the guy
[02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:10.720]   take it through to his conclusion.
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:13.720]   So I don't see any heroism
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:16.100]   and just letting yourself pass out.
[02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:20.320]   Now, things change when you get into a final.
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.080]   If you're in a final and you're ahead on points
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:27.200]   and you're willing to,
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:30.280]   most people at that point are gonna be willing
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:32.880]   to let something break in order to win a gold medal.
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.800]   At that point, I leave it up to the student.
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:38.400]   It's a deeply personal decision.
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:40.000]   I would never say to a student,
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.440]   "I expect you to let your body break
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:44.580]   "in order to win a gold medal."
[02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:47.760]   I think my students are more than mature enough
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:49.440]   to make up their own minds.
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.400]   I would be angry if they let their bodies break
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:56.920]   in a meaningless fashion in some random tournament
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:00.320]   or in a first round match where there's no way
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:04.240]   you could have go on to the second, third and fourth matches
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:05.620]   with a broken limb.
[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:11.760]   But in a final, in a gold medal match in ADCC,
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:13.440]   I would leave the decision to them,
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:15.060]   a spontaneous decision in the moment.
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:17.160]   I would be confident that I had prepared them
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:19.500]   to do their very best to defend themselves.
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:24.160]   But what ultimately they do is their decision.
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:29.080]   And winning ADCC is, for a grappler at least, life-changing.
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:30.880]   You're a world champion forever
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:33.520]   and no one can ever take that moment away from you.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:38.160]   So I would understand if they took a decision
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:39.440]   to take damage.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:40.720]   Hopefully it will never come to that
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:42.480]   because I do a good job of preparing people
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:45.160]   to get out of situations as you saw with Gary Turner.
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:47.040]   He was in a dreadful situation
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:48.520]   and got out within five seconds.
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:49.360]   - I saw that.
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.120]   - Gary's been in arm locks that looked like
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:54.520]   even I was in the corner going like,
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:56.080]   "Oh my God, what is happening here?"
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:57.280]   And still got out.
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:00.020]   So it comes down to training preparation.
[02:28:00.020 --> 02:28:02.960]   But if they did make that decision,
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:06.000]   I would understand provided it was a situation
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.240]   that would make their lives better.
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:11.560]   And they made a calculation, it's not an emotional thing.
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:13.400]   Now, sometimes you get emotional,
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:14.920]   you fight a guy you just don't like
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.720]   and you just don't wanna tap to him.
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:21.400]   Then things get a little more interesting.
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:24.720]   Then again, it's a personal decision.
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:25.920]   If you hate someone so much
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:28.240]   that you literally can't even conceive of yourself
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:29.200]   submitting to them,
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.960]   probably best you don't get into matches
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:33.960]   with them in the first place.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:37.980]   But if it should happen, again, it comes down to the student.
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:40.680]   I teach technique, not morals.
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:43.480]   So I let people make their own decisions on that.
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:45.080]   My thing is, look, don't get injured
[02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:46.400]   'cause if you're injured, you can't train.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.180]   You can't train, you can't get better.
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:50.480]   So stay away from injury as much as you can.
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:54.560]   - So one of the other incredible stories here is,
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:56.840]   as you mentioned, Nicholas Meragali,
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:01.840]   one of the incredible gi athletes in jiu-jitsu world,
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:06.920]   not ever having done no gi training or competition
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:09.280]   and so on in a period of a year.
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:11.160]   - Actually, it's significantly less than a year.
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:15.200]   Nicholas only came about six months, I believe,
[02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:18.120]   before ADCC as a phone call came from Gordon.
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:20.640]   He was just like, okay, Nicholas wants to come down
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:22.800]   and train, wants to move to Austin.
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:25.000]   So he came down, it was funny.
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.040]   I remember the first day Nicholas came in,
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:29.400]   Nicholas Meragali, as you can see,
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:32.680]   he's this tall, handsome Brazilian guy
[02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:35.440]   with a great personality and a wonderful smile.
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:37.240]   - Yeah, also a super nice guy.
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:38.960]   - So he comes in, he sits down on the mat,
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:40.720]   and we're all kind of looking at the new guy
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:42.800]   and introducing ourselves.
[02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:44.520]   And I look at him, I go,
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:47.160]   buddy, what the fuck are you doing here?
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:48.480]   And he's like, what do you mean?
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:53.040]   And I go, look at you, you're tall and good looking.
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:54.840]   You should be a fucking model, not a jiu-jitsu guy.
[02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:56.000]   Look at us, we're all fucked up
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.960]   with horrible bodies and bad personalities.
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:01.200]   You're like a happy, good-looking guy.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:02.880]   You should be surrounded by supermodels.
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:04.080]   What are you doing jiu-jitsu for?
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:07.120]   And he just laughed and he started training with us.
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:10.360]   So he came in.
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:13.800]   Now, historically, he has been an athlete
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:16.400]   who always pulled guard.
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:18.880]   In jiu-jitsu parlance for your viewers,
[02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:21.520]   in jiu-jitsu, you have the option
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:22.800]   of sitting down to the ground.
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:25.800]   Jiu-jitsu was mostly performed on the ground.
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:27.320]   And many athletes take advantage of this.
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:29.920]   They just come out and sit to the ground position
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:32.160]   and completely forego takedowns.
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.480]   Nicholas did this his entire career.
[02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:38.080]   Jiu-jitsu also is practiced both gi and no-gi.
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:43.080]   Nicholas was a shining light in the gi side of jiu-jitsu.
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.000]   He was one of the great champions of his era.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.120]   But he had not only never competed without a gi,
[02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:51.520]   he'd never even trained without a gi.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:54.840]   So there's significant differences between the two.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:30:55.760]   There's a lot of overlap,
[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:58.760]   but there's also some very significant differences.
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:01.400]   We're talking about a sport where even small differences
[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.920]   can make a difference between a guy
[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.480]   who gets the gold medal
[02:31:04.480 --> 02:31:07.440]   versus a guy who loses his first match.
[02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:08.920]   It doesn't take a lot.
[02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:13.920]   So this was a very, very tall order.
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:17.200]   - Yeah, a lot of his attacks involve the gi from guard.
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:18.040]   - Absolutely.
[02:31:18.040 --> 02:31:19.560]   - He's in a very dangerous attack.
[02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:22.240]   - He doesn't just wear the gi, he really uses the gi.
[02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:24.600]   Like 90% of what he's based around
[02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:26.400]   is based around a combination of cross
[02:31:26.400 --> 02:31:27.520]   and straight collar controls
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:29.960]   with the control of the sleeve cuff.
[02:31:29.960 --> 02:31:32.760]   And so he really actively uses the gi.
[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:35.200]   So when it came off, his first training decisions were like,
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:37.680]   oh, he looked like a fish out of water.
[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:41.600]   In addition, he had no experience of leg locking.
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:44.320]   So one of the most significant parts of the modern game,
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:45.400]   he just had nothing.
[02:31:45.400 --> 02:31:47.960]   - Plus the wrestling.
[02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:49.880]   - He had literally zero wrestling,
[02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:53.880]   which is half of ADCC is based around this.
[02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:56.600]   So ADCC is like six months away
[02:31:56.600 --> 02:32:00.160]   and he has to get ready for the gi world championships.
[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:03.240]   Nicholas had won many accolades in gi judo,
[02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:08.240]   but he had never won the open weight division of gi world.
[02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:10.680]   So he's like, the first day he's there, he's like,
[02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:15.680]   "John, I wanna be the first guy to win gi open weight
[02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:21.120]   and ADCC open weight in the same year."
[02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:21.960]   - Yeah.
[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:25.520]   - I'm like, yeah.
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:32.840]   Now in my mind, I'm thinking like,
[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:35.440]   yeah, that's never gonna fucking happen, you fucking weirdo.
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.200]   - Do you think there was a degree
[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:39.000]   to which he actually believed that?
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.480]   - A degree.
[02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:43.760]   He thought it was like a certainty.
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:46.400]   So he's looking at me like, yeah, I'm gonna do this.
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:50.560]   So I'm like, well, Nicholas, this is very laudable
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:53.840]   and I approve of your confidence,
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:56.080]   but this is a difficult goal you've set yourself.
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:59.840]   But perhaps maybe like 2024 would be a more realistic.
[02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:01.680]   He's like, no, no, I'm gonna do it.
[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:04.120]   - In all seriousness, it is incredible
[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:07.240]   that Nicholas Meragali had the guts
[02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:09.880]   to set such a nearly impossible goal.
[02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:13.280]   So what do you learn from this experience
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:16.400]   of setting a goal that most people would say
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:20.480]   is just unachievable and him actually almost doing it?
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:22.560]   - It's on the surface, just absolutely crazy.
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:24.920]   Like when he mentioned the goal to me,
[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:27.040]   I was, as I said, just looking at him
[02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:28.120]   in almost like disbelief.
[02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:29.820]   I didn't wanna show it on my face.
[02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:33.360]   And yet he came within inches of actually doing it.
[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:37.520]   He won his first ever gold in the open weight with the Gi
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:42.520]   and got to the finals and lost a tight decision
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:45.480]   in the finals to take a silver medal.
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:48.000]   He wanted two golds, he got a gold and a silver.
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:52.200]   And there's a sense in which the sheer audaciousness
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:57.200]   of the goal set seemed ludicrous when it first happened.
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:59.640]   This is insanity.
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:01.520]   And yet he came at it with a plan.
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:04.960]   He came at it with his characteristic passion and hard work
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:07.040]   and came within inches of doing so.
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:10.200]   And there's a sense in which you could look at it as,
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:12.700]   oh, he had a plan and it failed.
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:15.120]   And yet, of course, no one in their right mind
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:15.960]   would look at it that way.
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:18.600]   So he set an audacious goal so high
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:19.960]   that it seemed impossible.
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.040]   And it pulled his entire performance up to a level
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:26.280]   where even failure creates something truly memorable.
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:28.880]   - Do you encourage athletes
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:34.240]   or do you not get in their way when they set such a goal?
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:37.080]   Maybe even just, forget athletes, human nature.
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:38.860]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:42.040]   There's a sense in which, you know,
[02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:45.720]   you don't wanna make people delusional, that's sad.
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:50.720]   But I do believe that if people are sufficiently embedded
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:53.920]   in a given project, if they're committed to it
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:57.780]   to a certain degree, then you can skimp on many things
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:00.600]   in life, but don't skimp on your goals, okay?
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:02.240]   Because the bigger your goals,
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:03.560]   the bigger your achievements will be.
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:05.760]   And even failure, as we saw in the case
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.560]   of Nicholas Miragalli, I almost frowned,
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:11.960]   used the word failure, because if this is failure,
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:13.640]   give me more of it, you know?
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:16.720]   - Falling slightly short of perfection.
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:20.500]   - Falling short of what would otherwise be a perfect year.
[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:26.720]   Even that still creates such a massive uptick
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:30.480]   in your performance that it's absolutely
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:31.980]   the right way to go.
[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:35.180]   But there is a danger to this where people aren't committed
[02:35:35.180 --> 02:35:37.940]   and simply aren't working from a framework
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:40.860]   where they can realistically achieve these things,
[02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:42.820]   then it descends into delusion,
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:45.120]   and that direction goes towards madness.
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:46.340]   You can't have that.
[02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:49.820]   So there has to be some kind of reality check here
[02:35:49.820 --> 02:35:54.820]   where you have to be physically and mentally capable
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:58.300]   to some degree of moving towards these goals.
[02:35:58.300 --> 02:36:01.460]   You can't just, you know, a random blue belt
[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:03.420]   can't make audacious goals like that.
[02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:04.800]   It's just ludicrous.
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:09.800]   But with that in mind, if you're committed
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:14.680]   and there's a sense in which this is a definite possibility,
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:16.780]   set your goals high, okay?
[02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:18.020]   Make big demands.
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:19.560]   Yes, there'll be times of frustration.
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:21.920]   There'll be more failure in your lives than otherwise,
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:24.600]   but even your failures will be something great,
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:25.820]   something memorable.
[02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:28.240]   - See, but in the near term,
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:31.400]   you would be hard pressed to find any data
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:33.320]   that justifies that goal.
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:37.320]   Because in his case, he probably wasn't very good at Nogi
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:39.120]   even in the training room.
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:44.120]   So it's like, where do you look for even inklings of hope?
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:46.960]   - We saw an incremental progress
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:49.640]   with each successive competition that he was in.
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:55.520]   His first competition, he looked good, but not great.
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:57.760]   Second competition, a little better.
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:00.200]   Third competition, took on one of the legends
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:04.080]   of American grappling and won decisively.
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:05.740]   So there was a sense in which it was becoming
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:07.780]   more realistic with each outing.
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:12.120]   - So now putting that inspiring philosophy aside,
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:15.120]   what was the actual plan on how to make it happen?
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:16.920]   - So-- - So the leg locks.
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:18.720]   - First, same thing with John Carle.
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:20.400]   First, you gotta learn how to defend a leg lock.
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:25.400]   So initially, just as John Carle struggled, he struggled.
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:30.520]   Then he had to learn not just takedowns,
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:31.920]   but just how to set up a takedown.
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:34.400]   He had to learn basics like stance and motion
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:37.360]   and how to fight with the hands, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:39.760]   So he had to learn from the ground up.
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:44.080]   And then he had to improve.
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:46.200]   He always had a very good triangle,
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:47.360]   always had very good arm bar.
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:50.360]   Those were his two strengths coming into the no-gi training.
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:53.060]   And those translate pretty well between gi and no-gi.
[02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:55.200]   But he had no guillotine.
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:58.680]   He had no, his strangles from the back were,
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:00.240]   his great collar strangles from the back,
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:01.920]   but he really, really struggled
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:03.720]   with finishing people from the back.
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:06.440]   So he's learning all this.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:09.080]   And then he's like, "Well, now I gotta get ready
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:10.200]   "for the gi."
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:13.320]   So we had to switch his training to gi training.
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:15.560]   And that took out a couple of months.
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:18.000]   Then he went back briefly to Brazil
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.320]   and got a terrible rib injury
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:21.600]   right before the world championships
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:24.660]   and came back more or less unable to move.
[02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:26.880]   So the world championships is a week away.
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:28.960]   And he's like, "John, I can't move."
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:31.200]   So I'm like, "What are you gonna do?"
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:33.360]   He said, "I'm gonna compete."
[02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:35.600]   So I'm like, "Are you sure?"
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:37.160]   So we fly to California.
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:38.040]   He goes out and competes.
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:41.960]   His first opponent is literally the biggest man
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.320]   who competes in jiu-jitsu.
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:47.080]   This man is almost like 400 pounds.
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:48.800]   Nicholas has got completely broken ribs.
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:50.560]   We're taping up his ribs backstage
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:52.240]   before he goes out to compete.
[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:55.140]   He beats everyone by submission
[02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:58.380]   and wins for the first time the open weight,
[02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:02.520]   a title he had never won before.
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:05.620]   He steps off the mat, looks at me, he goes,
[02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:06.960]   "Well, I got the first of them."
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:10.840]   He won it, gi, open weight, and now ADCC.
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:12.600]   And now he can barely move.
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:14.800]   He's still gone through two days of brutal competition.
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:16.740]   And his ribs are completely screwed up.
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:19.920]   Takes a week off to try and get his ribs
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:21.320]   somewhere back in order,
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:24.640]   and then begins light training, building up to ADCC.
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:27.160]   We start putting him in no-gi competition.
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:33.240]   He fights two opponents of good quality,
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.800]   but not like world-beating quality.
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:39.000]   And then as his game starts improving,
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000]   we're getting closer and closer,
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.920]   he's starting to develop a sense
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:44.160]   where he can wrestle confidently on his feet.
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:49.160]   He's no longer easy to leg lock at all,
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:51.520]   and is starting to leg lock people.
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:55.320]   And is starting to get his very strong guard passing,
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:59.960]   which was based mostly around pant grips and the gi,
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:03.260]   to adapt to leg no-gi grips.
[02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:05.880]   In addition, he's starting to develop
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:07.760]   strong chest-to-chest positioning,
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:09.320]   which was never really part of his game,
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:11.320]   a pressure top game.
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:16.280]   And so things are looking good.
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:19.000]   He's matched against Rafael Lovato,
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.080]   one of the great competitors of ADCC,
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.920]   and wins a convincing victory,
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:27.720]   featuring a lot of takedowns and a lot of pressure passing.
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:29.960]   And people were just absolutely shocked.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:32.400]   I remember the staff of Flow Grappling
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:34.960]   coming and going like, "Who is this guy?
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:38.320]   He's literally transforming, he's like a different person."
[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:40.800]   So he goes into the World Championships.
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:43.000]   In his weight division,
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.560]   he was matched with a fellow Brazilian in the first match,
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:50.880]   and they had an absolute barn burning battle,
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:53.440]   where at one point, Nicholas was picked up and slammed,
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:56.340]   and then ended up winning by Kimura, beautiful Kimura.
[02:40:56.340 --> 02:41:01.560]   Then he took on the man who ultimately wins
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:04.460]   ADCC open weight division, and defeats him.
[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:07.080]   - And again, grueling matches.
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:08.400]   - Yeah, tough, tough match.
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:09.840]   Now, Yuri Samoi at that stage
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:12.360]   was two-time gold medalist in ADCC.
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:16.040]   Nicholas wins a very, very close match against him,
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:17.480]   and then fights Craig Jones,
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:20.960]   who's one of the best leg lockers in the world.
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:23.080]   So I think most people were expecting Nicholas
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:25.200]   to get leg locked very easily by Craig.
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.960]   Nicholas showed the degree to which he had improved
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:33.200]   his leg lock defense in a six-month period.
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:35.720]   Craig never really got close to the legs,
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:37.560]   and ended up becoming a takedown battle.
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:39.200]   Could have gone either way.
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:42.680]   Craig, I thought, did a really good job of pacing himself.
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:44.680]   Both athletes were very tired,
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:48.000]   but Nicholas was ahead on points,
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.080]   and then Craig hit one last takedown,
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:52.280]   which set Nicholas down to a hip.
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:55.760]   Didn't score, but it was the most aggressive takedown
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:58.800]   of that last period, and so Nicholas got the nod,
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:00.760]   and won a narrow victory.
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:02.920]   - Yeah, Craig commented afterwards.
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:06.020]   He said that, "I really wanted the submission,"
[02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:08.080]   and he said Nicholas seemed to have
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:09.600]   really wanted the submission,
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:11.880]   but it ended up being a grueling match.
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:16.480]   He took everything, like exhaustion-wise, everything he had.
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:18.280]   - It was a tough, tough match,
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:20.080]   and they were very well matched.
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:21.760]   Once they figured out they couldn't submit each other,
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:24.240]   it came down to their wrestling ability.
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:26.240]   Neither one of them was a wrestling specialist,
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:31.020]   but they're both competent in wrestling,
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:33.900]   and it became physically very, very tough.
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:37.420]   Then Nicholas went on to win the bronze medal
[02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:39.020]   in his weight division.
[02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:42.460]   So the next day, when we get called for the open weight,
[02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:44.820]   obviously Giancarlo had won a gold medal.
[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:49.900]   Everyone agreed that he should go into open weight.
[02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:51.500]   - Did Giancarlo agree?
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:53.760]   - Of course, he was--
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:57.100]   - I mean, 'cause he didn't have an easy format.
[02:42:57.100 --> 02:42:59.380]   - You don't order people until you ask them.
[02:42:59.380 --> 02:43:00.220]   - No, no, I know.
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:01.100]   - But he was delighted.
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:03.620]   - I guess the question I'm asking is,
[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:06.560]   how do you find the strength to then go on to absolutely,
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:11.200]   after, because you've done a 14-week training camp
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.520]   where every day was just as intense as any ADCC day,
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:16.600]   so you're used to it at that point.
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:19.480]   - But he had very, very long, tough matches.
[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:21.080]   - But he's used to it.
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:22.080]   He's a good athlete.
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:25.920]   So Nicholas and Giancarlo went out,
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:29.480]   and Giancarlo had a spectacular submission victory
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:30.860]   against his first opponent.
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:36.460]   Nicholas had some firework matches,
[02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:39.660]   and one of the toughest opponents he came up against
[02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:43.260]   was the brilliant Tai Ruatolo.
[02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:44.900]   They had an absolute barn burner.
[02:43:44.900 --> 02:43:47.340]   It was a very, very close match.
[02:43:47.340 --> 02:43:52.340]   And Tai had an incredible first two matches.
[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:54.860]   He'd beaten Pedro Mourinho by submission,
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:57.220]   and he'd beaten the great Felipe Pena
[02:43:57.220 --> 02:44:00.260]   in a very narrow match, very, very tight.
[02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:01.980]   Felipe lost on a guard pull.
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:06.560]   But Felipe is considerably bigger and stronger than Tai.
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:10.080]   So for Tai to win that match, even by a guard pull,
[02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:12.040]   was deeply impressive.
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:15.320]   It was an action-packed match that went back and forth.
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:16.160]   Very, very impressive.
[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:18.040]   - Can I ask you a small tangent?
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:21.000]   Both the Ruatolo brothers had an incredible performance.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.440]   What do you think makes them so good,
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:24.880]   if you were to analyze their game,
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:26.880]   sort of outside of just this specific match?
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:28.320]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:29.540]   There's a range of factors.
[02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:32.440]   One is that they started the sport very, very young.
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:37.440]   They're probably the first example in American grappling
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:43.380]   of American students who started at age four or five.
[02:44:43.380 --> 02:44:47.040]   Most people, when I began jiu-jitsu,
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:48.920]   started jiu-jitsu as adults.
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:51.320]   I was 28 years old when I had my first lesson
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:52.640]   as a white belt.
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:56.520]   So in time, people got a little younger.
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:44:59.940]   For example, Nicky Ryan started when I think he was 12.
[02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:04.940]   But the Ruatolo started when they were literally children.
[02:45:04.940 --> 02:45:06.140]   They had excellent coaching,
[02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:08.920]   going all the way up through into their teenage years.
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:13.300]   So they had the advantage of starting
[02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:16.540]   the way so many successful athletes do, as children,
[02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:20.060]   and going up through adulthood
[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:22.940]   and with strong coaching all along the way.
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:24.660]   Excellent parental support.
[02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:29.660]   So they had a great history where their youth
[02:45:29.660 --> 02:45:34.480]   didn't show off just how long they'd been in the sport.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:35.320]   - Right.
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:37.880]   - So you're dealing with a kid who's 19 years old,
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:40.320]   but he's been grappling for 15 years.
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:45.320]   And what counts is not your age, but your mat age.
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:47.720]   - Quality mat age.
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:50.480]   - Yeah, now they were very young in years,
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:52.760]   but they were very old in mat age.
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:56.320]   - But there's a lot of athletes that have now,
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:58.200]   as you correctly said,
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:01.680]   have spent from a very early age on the mat,
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:04.320]   but still these particular ones stand out.
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:05.160]   It's interesting.
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:06.520]   - Yeah, no, there's a lot more to it than that.
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:09.320]   This is just the first setting the scene.
[02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:11.720]   But what really makes them stand out
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:16.720]   is that they've mastered this idea of covering up
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.660]   and improving initial weaknesses
[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:22.500]   while building upon strengths.
[02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:24.960]   When the Rua Tolas first encountered my students,
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:27.440]   they were relatively easy to leg lock
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:29.320]   because none of their training experience
[02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:30.680]   had prepared them for that.
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:36.000]   Now, they were young at that time,
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.400]   I believe like 16 or 17,
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:41.680]   and it was an obvious problem for them.
[02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:46.680]   They both got heel hooked by my youngsters also,
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:51.320]   Nicky Ryan and Ethan Cralenston.
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:56.320]   And you could clearly see that they identified
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:47:02.440]   their current weakness and made prodigious steps
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:04.180]   to improve upon it to a point now
[02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:08.400]   where they're winning championships with their own leg locks.
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:11.060]   I love the fact that even as teenagers,
[02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:12.480]   they had the maturity to say,
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:14.880]   okay, here's an obvious weakness, let's get around this,
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:16.380]   let's turn it into a strength.
[02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:18.920]   I love the way they did that.
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:20.360]   - And focusing on the weakness
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:22.400]   and let that guide you to the thing you're working on.
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:25.660]   - But they also, they covered up their weaknesses,
[02:47:25.660 --> 02:47:29.660]   but they also understood what are our actual strengths.
[02:47:29.660 --> 02:47:32.280]   Now, physically, both of the brothers
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:35.400]   have extraordinary reach for their height.
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:39.520]   They both have extraordinarily long arms for their height.
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:42.480]   That means that variations of Karikatama,
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:44.680]   in particular, Dastas, Anacondas,
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:47.680]   are gonna be much easier for them
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:49.400]   and their weight division than for most people.
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:50.400]   - These are all chokes.
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:51.960]   - Yes, strangleholds.
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:54.520]   So they specialize in those.
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:57.440]   They adapted a game based around movement
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:02.540]   which forces opponents, not with physical pressure,
[02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:05.160]   but with tactical pressure into positions
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:08.560]   which expose them to those specialized strangleholds
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:09.400]   that they use.
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:15.360]   Traditionally, when we looked at the Rutoas
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:17.500]   when they were young, we saw that there was a disparity
[02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:19.260]   between their top game and their bottom game.
[02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:21.520]   They were generally much better in top position
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.440]   than they were in bottom position.
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:26.640]   Again, they saw that as a potential weakness
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:28.880]   and they turned it around using, again,
[02:48:28.880 --> 02:48:33.560]   their unique long limbs relative to their height.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:36.720]   And they make use of a buggy strangle.
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:38.880]   I'm not sure why it's referred to as a buggy strangle,
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:41.280]   but basically it's a variation of Karikatama
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:43.720]   using the legs done from disadvantageous positions
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:45.040]   on bottom.
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:47.680]   And they both make brilliant use of that,
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:49.620]   not so much as a strangle weapon.
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:51.100]   Occasionally they'll strangle someone with it,
[02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:53.100]   but they mostly use it to create pressure
[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:54.900]   to make people back off.
[02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:56.820]   And as a result, they're able to,
[02:48:56.820 --> 02:49:00.900]   they overcame the disparity between their top game
[02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:01.900]   and their bottom game.
[02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:04.260]   Now their bottom game is part of their offense
[02:49:04.260 --> 02:49:06.380]   and they're very, very successful from there.
[02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:09.860]   And so again, you had that really impressive sense
[02:49:09.860 --> 02:49:12.380]   in which they identified their weaknesses in leg locks
[02:49:12.380 --> 02:49:14.300]   and bottom position, turned it around
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:16.220]   and made it into strengths.
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:18.000]   And at the same time, they identified,
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.360]   okay, what are our physical gifts
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:22.480]   and how can we maximize their use?
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:24.560]   And they created a program of initiating movement
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:27.040]   that created tactical rather than physical pressure
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:28.840]   to set up their best strangle holds.
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:31.320]   I deeply admire what they've done.
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:34.520]   Those two young men have a huge future ahead of them.
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:37.720]   - And so here, one of the brothers faces
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:40.480]   in the absolute, Nicholas Meragali.
[02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:43.120]   - Now bear in mind, Tai has just fought
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:46.580]   two very tough matches against guys bigger
[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:48.020]   and stronger than himself.
[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:49.300]   So he's coming into a third match
[02:49:49.300 --> 02:49:52.580]   against a third guy who's also bigger than he is.
[02:49:52.580 --> 02:49:55.700]   So hats off to Tai fighting open weight
[02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:57.640]   against three monsters in a row.
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:02.860]   Now Tai and Cade, one of their best attributes
[02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:04.600]   is they're two of the best scramblers
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:06.140]   in the sport of Jiu Jitsu.
[02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:09.980]   So whenever you go to shoot on the legs with them,
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:11.860]   there's a danger of running straight into
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:12.860]   a da strangle hold.
[02:50:12.860 --> 02:50:14.860]   They're very competent at counterattacking
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:16.500]   single legs with da strangles.
[02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:21.040]   It's also very hard to control them after a takedown.
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:24.340]   They do a very good job of springing back up to the feet.
[02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:28.500]   So I told Nicholas to favor upper body Judo based takedowns
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:29.840]   rather than wrestling takedowns.
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:32.460]   And you see here a fine example of Nicholas's
[02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:33.940]   gathering skill in Uchimata,
[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:36.540]   one of the great throws of Judo.
[02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:42.120]   - Set up with a, there's a bit of a foot sweep.
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:44.300]   (chuckles)
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:45.140]   Like a...
[02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:45.960]   - Good.
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:50.000]   The nice thing is he starts off with what it looks like.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.840]   It's actually a two directional Uchimata.
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:54.900]   He threatens Uchigari to the back.
[02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:57.080]   That's a throw that throws your opponent to the back.
[02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:58.440]   His opponent pushes into him,
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:00.760]   then he changes direction with a support foot
[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:03.040]   and takes him over with Uchimata.
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:06.140]   As we said earlier, the great advantage of Judo
[02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:09.260]   over wrestling is that because there's upper body connection
[02:51:09.260 --> 02:51:11.660]   during the throw and after the throw,
[02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:14.280]   it's much harder for an opponent to scramble away from you.
[02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:16.640]   And even Tai Ryutaro is one of the best scramblers
[02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:20.760]   in the sport, has to stop scrambling here
[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:22.960]   and just go back to guard position
[02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:25.920]   and enable Nicholas to hold top position.
[02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:28.300]   - I mean, some of it is also the surprise.
[02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:31.320]   There is something less understandable about Judo techniques
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:35.680]   because there's less data, it feels like.
[02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:37.480]   - The Ryutaro's also have a good Uchimata.
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:39.960]   I think they're very familiar with it.
[02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:41.460]   How often do you think are they
[02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:43.500]   on the receiving end of an Uchimata?
[02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:44.340]   - That's a good point, yeah.
[02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:46.380]   - So I just feel like they have more data
[02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:47.600]   in terms of defending.
[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:50.980]   I mean, of course, there is fundamentals to the Uchimata
[02:51:50.980 --> 02:51:53.740]   that make it difficult to scramble around, but.
[02:51:53.740 --> 02:51:56.380]   - This is a good example of someone
[02:51:56.380 --> 02:51:59.380]   who literally didn't have a single takedown six months ago.
[02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:02.020]   Now he's throwing one of the toughest guys in the sport
[02:52:02.020 --> 02:52:04.100]   with one of the more difficult throws of Judo.
[02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:05.940]   Now you're a Judo man.
[02:52:05.940 --> 02:52:07.260]   You'll back me up on this.
[02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:09.180]   Uchimata's not an easy throw to learn.
[02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:10.120]   It takes some time.
[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:12.600]   You're hopping on one foot with both of your body weight.
[02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:14.240]   - It's very counterintuitive.
[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:17.680]   - Yeah, it's one of the more difficult throws.
[02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:21.400]   - Let go of your understanding of takedowns,
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:23.200]   of maybe wrestling style takedowns,
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:26.880]   or more intuitive kind of takedowns to understand it.
[02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:28.200]   There's many throws like this.
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:31.560]   Uchigari is like this, Sotogari is like this,
[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:33.840]   Uchimata is like this, it's weird.
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:36.280]   What, I'm on one foot, I'm hopping around?
[02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:37.800]   This makes no sense.
[02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:38.720]   But it works.
[02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:40.660]   Foot sweeps are also weird in that way.
[02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:41.720]   They're a little bit more intuitive,
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:44.860]   but to get very good at foot sweeps,
[02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:48.100]   you have to understand timing, weight distribution.
[02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:51.880]   It's a dynamic thing that's weird.
[02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:54.440]   - I always laugh when I talk to Nicholas.
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:58.140]   I say, you know, I try to teach him a single leg,
[02:52:58.140 --> 02:53:00.320]   which is traditionally most,
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:01.400]   you know, like a high single leg
[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:03.320]   is one of the easier takedowns to perform
[02:53:03.320 --> 02:53:05.480]   in terms of mechanical difficulty.
[02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:08.400]   And Nicholas always struggles with it.
[02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:10.920]   And then I teach him one of the more difficult takedowns,
[02:53:10.920 --> 02:53:14.280]   Uchimata, and he does it flawlessly.
[02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:16.360]   - You never know, certain things get attached.
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:17.480]   I mean, you see this in judo.
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:19.080]   It's kind of interesting to see
[02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:22.520]   there's classes of takedowns,
[02:53:22.520 --> 02:53:25.720]   and certain people just gravitate
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:28.400]   in their philosophical, intuitive understanding
[02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:30.520]   of body mechanics or something like this.
[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:32.440]   It's like Seinagi versus Uchimata.
[02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:36.680]   You very clearly see there's some people that understand,
[02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:40.160]   they like to have both their feet planted on the ground,
[02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:42.840]   and there's some people that are okay
[02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:45.240]   with this one foot on the ground
[02:53:45.240 --> 02:53:47.360]   and the other one is doing something else.
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:49.600]   And I think that, I don't know what that,
[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:50.600]   what is that, I don't know.
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:51.680]   It's what makes you fall in love
[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:53.220]   with one field versus another.
[02:53:53.220 --> 02:53:56.240]   So what, can you speak to that,
[02:53:56.240 --> 02:53:59.080]   that you've released a new instructional
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:02.280]   on takedowns and standing skills for jiu-jitsu,
[02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:04.600]   just at a high level,
[02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:08.520]   using Nicholas as an example,
[02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:12.720]   what are some key ideas about takedowns?
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:15.400]   - Okay, first, whenever people talk
[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:17.800]   about standing position in jiu-jitsu,
[02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:20.800]   they always say, oh, I need to learn some takedowns.
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:24.880]   But it's never a question of just learning the takedowns.
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:28.080]   It's learning the prerequisites to the takedowns.
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:30.640]   The takedowns are more or less like an afterthought.
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:36.000]   You've got to begin with stance, motion,
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.840]   the ability to engage in grip and contact,
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:40.400]   get your opponent out of balance,
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:43.320]   and then comes the takedowns.
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:45.660]   The takedowns in jiu-jitsu are mostly divided
[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:47.840]   into lower body takedowns, tackles to the legs,
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:50.080]   single legs, double legs,
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:52.280]   to a lesser degree, high crotch in jiu-jitsu.
[02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:55.680]   And then upper body takedowns,
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:57.880]   which are mostly judo derived.
[02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:03.360]   Nicholas had to start more or less at the ground.
[02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:04.920]   I didn't even know how to come out
[02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:06.600]   and make grips or hold a stance.
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:09.680]   So he had to learn every element of it.
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:12.400]   And the fact he was able to do so in six months
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.240]   was just incredible.
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:19.240]   - Can you comment on the upward posture
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:21.200]   that seems to work for jiu-jitsu?
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:23.160]   - The matches in jiu-jitsu are much longer
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:25.080]   than the matches in wrestling.
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:27.440]   In addition, there are many kinds of submission threat,
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:29.280]   which are not there in wrestling.
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:31.960]   So the stance has to be significantly changed.
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:35.000]   In wrestling, they favor generally a very low crouch,
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.120]   because the vast majority of attacks
[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:38.780]   are tackles to the legs.
[02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:41.120]   So anyone who stands upright in wrestling
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:42.520]   tends to get heavily punished
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:45.340]   by being taken down immediately with a leg tackle.
[02:55:45.340 --> 02:55:49.760]   In jiu-jitsu, the matches are so much longer,
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:52.160]   it would be difficult in a 40 minute match, for example,
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:56.320]   to maintain a bent over crouch, you'd be exhausted.
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:55:58.920]   There's also problems associated with submission holds.
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:00.960]   There are many forms of submission hold,
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:02.200]   guillotines, dasas, et cetera,
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:03.600]   where if your head comes down too low,
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:05.920]   you become a little vulnerable to this.
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:09.560]   And so the stances in jiu-jitsu competition
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:12.760]   tend to be much more upright, more like judo and greco.
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:15.160]   So right off the bat, you see the stance is different.
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:18.400]   The motion tends to be much slower and more evenly paced,
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:19.340]   because you've got to be able to do this
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:21.040]   for long periods of time.
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:23.560]   So the number of fakes per minute,
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:25.960]   the number of shots attempted per minute
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:27.760]   is usually much lower.
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:32.320]   So these are obvious differences.
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:34.680]   The biggest difference, however,
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:37.480]   has nothing to do with that, it has to do with tactics.
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:42.480]   In jiu-jitsu, the scores will be judged
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:45.840]   by what happens after the takedown.
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:50.680]   In the case of ADCC, you can take someone down
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:55.400]   in ways that would score in both wrestling and judo,
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:58.620]   and possibly even win the match in the case of judo,
[02:56:58.620 --> 02:57:01.360]   and it would score zero in ADCC
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:04.080]   because of the nature of the rules.
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:06.720]   The whole idea of ADCC scoring
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:10.360]   is to demonstrate control after the takedown.
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:12.320]   It's what happens in the critical three seconds
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:15.520]   after the takedown that creates the score.
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:18.160]   In judo and in wrestling,
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:23.160]   the emphasis is placed on the takedown itself.
[02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:25.480]   In jiu-jitsu, the emphasis is placed
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:27.520]   on the aftermath of the takedown.
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:29.320]   That's where the score is allocated.
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:33.040]   And that can be a period of up to three seconds.
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:34.680]   Now, three seconds doesn't sound like much,
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:36.560]   but in a scramble after a takedown,
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:38.780]   three seconds is a fucking eternity.
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:40.120]   It goes on forever.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:43.920]   And so you will see many examples of takedowns
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:47.360]   that, as I said, would score very well
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:49.360]   in judo and wrestling,
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:52.160]   but don't score at all on ADCC.
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:54.520]   And so the whole skill becomes
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:56.060]   packaging the standing position
[02:57:56.060 --> 02:57:59.280]   in terms of the takedowns themselves,
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:01.600]   but in particular, preparing the athletes
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:04.880]   for that critical three seconds after the takedown.
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:08.200]   That's why many people who are very fine wrestlers
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:09.700]   struggle in ADCC.
[02:58:09.700 --> 02:58:13.680]   They take people down by wrestling metric all the time,
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:16.720]   but don't score under ADCC rules.
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:19.200]   - What makes GSB so good at takedowns?
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:20.960]   I've gotten a chance to even recently
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:22.320]   watch him do takedowns.
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:26.840]   Is it within this framework that you're teaching,
[02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:28.480]   what stands out to you about him
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:29.640]   that you draw lessons from?
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:31.760]   - Yeah, that's another example
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:34.680]   of someone who's performing takedowns
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:37.600]   in a rule set radically different from wrestling.
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:41.680]   Just as the ADCC rule set is so different
[02:58:41.680 --> 02:58:44.580]   from conventional wrestling rule sets
[02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:48.120]   that the whole manner in which you approach takedowns
[02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:50.200]   and even your understanding of takedowns
[02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:54.320]   has to be quite strongly modified.
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:56.500]   So to an MMA, it's even more extreme.
[02:58:56.500 --> 02:58:59.520]   People always think, "Oh, this guy's a good wrestler.
[02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:02.840]   He should be able to get takedowns in MMA easily."
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:05.920]   What you find is that the wrestling skills in MMA
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:08.320]   enable you to finish takedowns.
[02:59:08.320 --> 02:59:10.200]   If you get in on your opponent
[02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:13.080]   and get to the legs or the waist or what have you,
[02:59:13.080 --> 02:59:14.840]   your wrestling skill will enable you
[02:59:14.840 --> 02:59:16.860]   to finish the takedown.
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:21.440]   But getting to the takedown is massively different
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:23.840]   in the context of MMA than it is in wrestling.
[02:59:23.840 --> 02:59:25.680]   The entire stance is different.
[02:59:25.680 --> 02:59:29.960]   The entire set of distancing is different.
[02:59:29.960 --> 02:59:32.560]   There's the idea of positioning within a cage,
[02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:36.600]   like how close you are to the perimeter of the cage
[02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:39.000]   changes radically how you approach the takedown.
[02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:43.400]   The setups are literally night and day different.
[02:59:43.400 --> 02:59:47.700]   The setups are almost entirely composed of striking setups
[02:59:47.700 --> 02:59:49.500]   rather than grappling setups.
[02:59:49.500 --> 02:59:53.860]   And so the act of getting to the takedown
[02:59:53.860 --> 02:59:57.060]   is like a completely different sport.
[02:59:57.060 --> 02:59:59.740]   Now, George studied wrestling
[02:59:59.740 --> 03:00:03.220]   and used to go to wrestling practice twice a week.
[03:00:03.220 --> 03:00:05.180]   In Canada, they do freestyle wrestling.
[03:00:05.180 --> 03:00:07.780]   They don't use the American college style of wrestling.
[03:00:07.780 --> 03:00:10.420]   Now, George's main emphasis in wrestling training
[03:00:10.420 --> 03:00:12.020]   was takedowns.
[03:00:12.020 --> 03:00:16.560]   Obviously, the whole ground element of freestyle wrestling
[03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:17.680]   was of no interest to him,
[03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:20.380]   like learning how to put people's back on the ground
[03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:23.800]   and turn them with leg laces and gut wrenches
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:25.760]   was of no value in MMA.
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:27.760]   So he devoted almost all of his study
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:30.040]   to just the act of taking someone down.
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:34.680]   So in pure wrestling, George is not bad.
[03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:39.000]   I think he'd be a very competitive match
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:43.000]   even for a highly ranked American freestyle wrestler.
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.240]   Obviously, he would lose easily on the ground
[03:00:45.240 --> 03:00:46.640]   'cause he's not used to the part here.
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:49.760]   He'd probably be leg laced or gut wrenched quite easily
[03:00:49.760 --> 03:00:51.480]   by a skilled opponent.
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:53.000]   But in just a pure takedown battle,
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.200]   he'd be a competitive training partner
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:57.640]   for even a good wrestler.
[03:00:57.640 --> 03:01:00.080]   But in actual MMA competition,
[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:02.800]   he could take down even the most highly credentialed
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:05.080]   wrestlers and in some cases,
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:06.640]   make it look almost effortless.
[03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:11.840]   And that came from his unification
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:13.560]   of striking skill with wrestling.
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:16.080]   So he used wrestling skills to finish the takedown
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:20.280]   and his karate and kickboxing pedigree
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:22.640]   to enter into the takedown.
[03:01:22.640 --> 03:01:25.400]   Now, when he initiated the study of this,
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:29.200]   this was at a time when MMA was pretty much in its infancy.
[03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:34.200]   And he was one of the most impressive people
[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:37.520]   I've ever seen in this regard.
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:39.120]   He was a true innovator.
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:44.120]   He innovated this specialized area of striking to a takedown
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:48.040]   to a greater degree than anyone else I'm aware of.
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:49.680]   - Well, let me ask you about this innovation
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:51.840]   because you're one of the most innovative people
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:54.880]   in martial arts.
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:57.600]   There's several major categories of innovation
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:01:59.600]   that you have led.
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:05.520]   Obviously, leg locks, body lock, now wrestling.
[03:02:06.520 --> 03:02:11.520]   What's your process of innovation?
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:17.840]   So seeing the problems in a particular system,
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:23.440]   the gaps, how do you identify them?
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:24.920]   And how do you figure out systems
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:27.680]   of how to fill those gaps?
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:32.680]   - First thing I look for is what are the current weaknesses
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:36.200]   in a given combat sport?
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:38.880]   So in the case of jiu-jitsu,
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:41.320]   it was very obvious that historically,
[03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:43.560]   jiu-jitsu had always been weak in leg locking.
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:44.920]   Jiu-jitsu had always been weak
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:48.680]   in standing position overall.
[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:52.760]   And these were things that needed
[03:02:52.760 --> 03:02:56.040]   to be sorted out immediately.
[03:02:56.040 --> 03:02:58.640]   In its infancy, mixed martial arts was divided
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:01.480]   between grapplers and strikers.
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:06.480]   And most of the emphasis in early mixed martial arts
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:12.200]   was on the idea of specialists in a given domain
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:14.760]   forcing the fight into their domain.
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:20.680]   And that my early work with Georges St-Pierre
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:23.400]   convinced me that the right approach
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:25.960]   wasn't increased specialization
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:29.840]   and learning to force your athlete
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:31.720]   into that area of specialization
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:33.520]   at the expense of the opponent,
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:36.280]   but rather the real battles of the future
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:41.280]   would be won and lost not with techniques per se,
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:43.080]   specialized techniques,
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:45.880]   but rather the integration of techniques
[03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:49.480]   and the overlap between the various grappling
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:51.200]   and striking skills.
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:56.200]   So that someone who was an inferior grappler
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:58.240]   would have just enough grappling skills
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:03:59.680]   to be able to hold a grappler off
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:03.880]   and then defeat them with striking.
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:05.800]   And a striker who was,
[03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:08.680]   if you went to fight someone
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:10.600]   who's superior to you in striking,
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:12.120]   you would have just enough striking skill
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:13.840]   to be able to hold them at bay
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:15.720]   and then enter into grappling.
[03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:18.480]   This went further and further until it got clear
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:21.040]   that there were whole areas of the sport
[03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:24.280]   that you needed to change your entire mindset about them.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.120]   So that people went into early MMA
[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:31.200]   thinking in terms of grappler and striker.
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:35.440]   What I started to think is in terms of,
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:39.240]   okay, there are four fundamental skill areas
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:41.080]   of mixed martial arts.
[03:04:41.080 --> 03:04:42.600]   There is shoot boxing,
[03:04:42.600 --> 03:04:47.600]   which is the integration of takedowns and striking.
[03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:50.880]   There is clinch boxing,
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:54.000]   which is the integration of upper body clinch skills
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:55.360]   combined with striking.
[03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:56.800]   There is fence boxing,
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:04:59.800]   which the two athletes are locked up with each other
[03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:03.320]   on the fence and they have to integrate
[03:05:03.320 --> 03:05:06.080]   takedown defense and striking skills.
[03:05:06.080 --> 03:05:07.400]   And there is grapple boxing,
[03:05:07.400 --> 03:05:10.920]   which is the merging of ground grappling with striking.
[03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:14.800]   And when you broke MMA down into those four categories,
[03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:18.400]   you saw that each one of those four domains
[03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:23.400]   transcends the specialized martial arts
[03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:26.440]   that form their components.
[03:05:26.440 --> 03:05:29.380]   So for example, in clinch boxing,
[03:05:29.380 --> 03:05:31.120]   you would incorporate things from judo,
[03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:34.400]   Greco-Roman, freestyle, jiu-jitsu submissions,
[03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:36.600]   Muay Thai, clinching techniques.
[03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:41.640]   But even if you took all five of those,
[03:05:41.640 --> 03:05:46.020]   the rule set that you're operating in
[03:05:46.020 --> 03:05:48.660]   required such extensive modification
[03:05:48.660 --> 03:05:50.960]   that the final product of clinch boxing
[03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:55.280]   transcended all five of its component martial arts
[03:05:55.280 --> 03:05:57.240]   and became its own autonomous skill,
[03:05:57.240 --> 03:05:59.520]   needed to be worked autonomously.
[03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:04.280]   And when we broke George's training
[03:06:04.280 --> 03:06:06.060]   down into those four areas,
[03:06:06.060 --> 03:06:07.840]   that's when real progress started to be made.
[03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:11.920]   That's when you started to see the integration
[03:06:11.920 --> 03:06:16.120]   of those four phases and the striking and grappling
[03:06:16.120 --> 03:06:20.340]   within each of them was where victory was being won
[03:06:20.340 --> 03:06:21.180]   and lost.
[03:06:21.180 --> 03:06:26.180]   - So once you reframe how you see a particular combat sport,
[03:06:26.180 --> 03:06:30.440]   then you could start doing these detailed development
[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:34.520]   of ideas that actually, like, they fit.
[03:06:34.520 --> 03:06:36.760]   - There's a sense in which it had to start
[03:06:36.760 --> 03:06:38.160]   with a paradigm shift,
[03:06:38.160 --> 03:06:40.760]   and then a research program began after that.
[03:06:40.760 --> 03:06:42.160]   You don't start with research,
[03:06:42.160 --> 03:06:45.040]   you start with a paradigm shift and then went to research.
[03:06:45.040 --> 03:06:46.000]   - Well, let me ask you,
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:49.680]   I got a chance to hang out with you and Hanzo Gracie
[03:06:49.680 --> 03:06:51.240]   at ADCC.
[03:06:51.240 --> 03:06:53.680]   He keeps messaging me saying he's gonna call me
[03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:55.120]   and not calling me.
[03:06:55.120 --> 03:06:58.200]   I think aside from being hilarious, charismatic,
[03:06:58.200 --> 03:07:03.200]   and handsome, he is also,
[03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:06.620]   and wise for his young age.
[03:07:06.620 --> 03:07:08.540]   He's also one of the greatest coaches
[03:07:08.540 --> 03:07:11.160]   and athletes of all time in martial arts.
[03:07:11.160 --> 03:07:14.200]   So let me ask, what have you learned about life
[03:07:14.200 --> 03:07:15.640]   from Hanzo Gracie?
[03:07:16.660 --> 03:07:21.420]   - The degree of difficulty that Hanzo must have encountered,
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:23.560]   he never talked to us about it,
[03:07:23.560 --> 03:07:27.980]   but I figured this out as the years went by.
[03:07:27.980 --> 03:07:31.020]   The degree of difficulty that he must have experienced
[03:07:31.020 --> 03:07:34.220]   when he first came to Manhattan and started teaching,
[03:07:34.220 --> 03:07:35.980]   it must have just been incredible.
[03:07:35.980 --> 03:07:38.960]   You gotta remember, Hanzo came from Brazil,
[03:07:38.960 --> 03:07:42.900]   training with the best people in the world at that time,
[03:07:42.900 --> 03:07:47.900]   you know, Hickson, all the machados.
[03:07:47.900 --> 03:07:52.580]   All of them were located around Gracie Baja
[03:07:52.580 --> 03:07:57.580]   and that Rio de Janeiro set.
[03:07:57.580 --> 03:08:02.260]   They all knew each other and they all trained together.
[03:08:02.260 --> 03:08:04.360]   They had internal problems, of course,
[03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:07.340]   but they all knew each other well
[03:08:07.340 --> 03:08:08.820]   and knew each other's games.
[03:08:08.820 --> 03:08:13.060]   So all of them had beautiful and highly developed jiu-jitsu.
[03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:16.160]   So all Hanzo knew from childhood on
[03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:18.620]   was perfect, beautiful jiu-jitsu
[03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:20.740]   and communicating with other people
[03:08:20.740 --> 03:08:23.700]   who also knew perfect, beautiful jiu-jitsu.
[03:08:23.700 --> 03:08:29.460]   Then he comes to New York where he has to teach
[03:08:29.460 --> 03:08:34.500]   in a language that he, at that stage, barely spoke
[03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:37.220]   to a bunch of fucking morons
[03:08:37.220 --> 03:08:40.500]   who didn't even, on my first day in jiu-jitsu,
[03:08:40.500 --> 03:08:41.740]   they had to explain to me the difference
[03:08:41.740 --> 03:08:43.460]   between the mount and the guard
[03:08:43.460 --> 03:08:44.740]   'cause as far as I was concerned,
[03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:47.260]   yeah, you're on top, it's the same thing.
[03:08:47.260 --> 03:08:48.980]   And they're like, no, no, no,
[03:08:48.980 --> 03:08:50.340]   mounted is different from guard.
[03:08:50.340 --> 03:08:51.180]   And I'm like, no, it's not.
[03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:52.880]   Like, you're on top of the guy.
[03:08:52.880 --> 03:08:53.720]   You just hit him.
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:55.580]   - So he has to argue with you about this.
[03:08:55.580 --> 03:08:59.580]   - Imagine going from training with Hicks and Gracie
[03:08:59.580 --> 03:09:02.220]   to having to tell some moron
[03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:04.440]   that guard is different from mount.
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:08.320]   And we were so primitive back then.
[03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:12.400]   He went from the best training culture in the world
[03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:13.920]   to literally the worst.
[03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:17.160]   Just a bunch of guys in their mid-20s
[03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:20.980]   who knew nothing about the ground, just--
[03:09:20.980 --> 03:09:23.480]   - Well, luckily he's known for his patience.
[03:09:23.480 --> 03:09:25.740]   (laughing)
[03:09:25.740 --> 03:09:30.200]   - Out of that, he molded one of the greatest gyms ever
[03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:31.040]   in New York.
[03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:34.680]   - Yes, he did a fantastic job.
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:36.980]   And most of it was based around the idea
[03:09:36.980 --> 03:09:39.080]   that he gave us complete freedom.
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:40.960]   We came in, we trained all day,
[03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:44.300]   and I started teaching beginners classes.
[03:09:44.300 --> 03:09:48.640]   And then some of his senior students,
[03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:51.600]   Hikaru, Hodrigo, Gracie, and Matt, Sarah,
[03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:54.840]   opened their own schools around the tri-state area.
[03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:56.520]   So they left.
[03:09:56.520 --> 03:09:57.860]   There was a vacuum of teachers
[03:09:57.860 --> 03:09:59.560]   and he asked me to start teaching.
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:04.520]   I taught for many, many years there.
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:06.440]   And he always gave us complete freedom.
[03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:09.160]   His only thing was to say, "Okay, do whatever you want.
[03:10:09.160 --> 03:10:11.460]   "Just make sure it's effective.
[03:10:11.460 --> 03:10:12.920]   "Prove to me it's effective."
[03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:16.600]   And that's the best research program you can ever have.
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:17.720]   Show me proof.
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:24.440]   So many times, especially in those days in jujitsu,
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:26.920]   there were so many things that were just off limits.
[03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:28.360]   You couldn't study Legos.
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:30.200]   You couldn't do this, you couldn't do that.
[03:10:30.200 --> 03:10:32.400]   This kind of game was for cowards.
[03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:34.280]   This is the only kind of game we accept.
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:35.760]   And Hinsa was never like that.
[03:10:35.760 --> 03:10:38.360]   He was just like, "Okay, just do what you want.
[03:10:38.360 --> 03:10:40.040]   "Prove to me it works."
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:43.200]   And if you give people that simple structure,
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:45.880]   you give them some time, some ingenuity,
[03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:47.480]   a lot of things can happen.
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:49.100]   - I gotta ask you, and by the way,
[03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:50.920]   he'll come on this podcast,
[03:10:50.920 --> 03:10:52.920]   and I do feel like it's a little bit like
[03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:54.920]   riding a dragon or a bull of some kind.
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:56.960]   It'll be a fun journey.
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:10:59.680]   I can't, at least from my perspective,
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:02.280]   having interacted with him, having met him,
[03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:05.280]   it's hard not to smile from his stories.
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:07.480]   - He's easily one of the most charismatic people in jujitsu.
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:12.040]   - It's kind of fun to watch that humans can be like this too.
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:15.640]   It's just the love that radiates from him is incredible.
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:17.520]   I gotta ask you, this is from Reddit.
[03:11:17.520 --> 03:11:21.080]   There's a few legends that come from that gym,
[03:11:21.080 --> 03:11:25.080]   but people on Reddit kept asking about some guy named Boris.
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:26.840]   Apparently you coached him at Hensos,
[03:11:26.840 --> 03:11:31.320]   and he was a legend, and he was terrifyingly good.
[03:11:31.320 --> 03:11:32.600]   What made him a legend?
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:34.280]   Who is this Boris character?
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:36.000]   - Boris is one of my early students.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.840]   I think he was either my first or second black belt.
[03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:40.160]   Boris came from Long Island.
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:41.640]   He was a wrestler.
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:45.680]   He was of Russian Jewish descent,
[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:47.440]   and highly intelligent.
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:50.040]   Now he was short of stature,
[03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:53.740]   but very powerfully built and compact.
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:11:59.800]   Very nice, polite young man,
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:02.960]   but also slightly eccentric,
[03:12:02.960 --> 03:12:05.680]   which I always liked about him.
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:10.600]   He would always come dressed with glasses on,
[03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:15.520]   and he would leave the gym dressed like,
[03:12:15.520 --> 03:12:18.840]   to use the American phrase, a complete nerd,
[03:12:18.840 --> 03:12:21.280]   with his pocket protector.
[03:12:21.280 --> 03:12:23.800]   And now he was heavily muscled,
[03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:26.120]   but he would dress in such a way that it didn't appear so
[03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:27.320]   when he left.
[03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:28.640]   And we always used to laugh.
[03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:31.520]   Like, you imagine some guy tried to mug Boris.
[03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:33.480]   They would see him with his nerdy glasses on
[03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:34.600]   and his pocket protector,
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:37.040]   and they would literally run into
[03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:39.160]   like one of the most formidable human beings
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:40.880]   in the entire New York area.
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:44.120]   Boris started training jujitsu, I believe, in Long Island.
[03:12:44.120 --> 03:12:48.400]   And then when he got a tech job in Manhattan,
[03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:51.060]   started training with us in a morning class.
[03:12:51.060 --> 03:12:54.160]   Now, these were relatively early days in Manhattan
[03:12:54.160 --> 03:12:56.040]   and in my teaching career.
[03:12:56.040 --> 03:13:00.000]   And he and a group of others, a very small group,
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:01.560]   used to train early in the morning,
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:04.160]   around 6 a.m. before work.
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:08.060]   And Boris was a legend in those days.
[03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:10.280]   Now, a very young George St. Pierre
[03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:15.760]   came to train with us at that time,
[03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:18.960]   and he would come in at 6 a.m. to do his morning class.
[03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:23.960]   And he was one of the main training partners for Boris.
[03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:26.700]   And Boris being a wrestler,
[03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:28.860]   he used to generally prefer top position.
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:30.700]   And I would always encourage George
[03:13:30.700 --> 03:13:32.220]   to play bottom position.
[03:13:32.220 --> 03:13:33.720]   I'd say, "You gotta get good in bottom position.
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:34.560]   "You never know.
[03:13:34.560 --> 03:13:35.380]   "I know you're good at takedowns,
[03:13:35.380 --> 03:13:37.120]   "but one day someone's gonna put you down,
[03:13:37.120 --> 03:13:38.920]   "so you gotta work bottom position."
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:41.820]   And Boris had very strong guard passing.
[03:13:41.820 --> 03:13:44.020]   I remember one of George's happiest days
[03:13:44.020 --> 03:13:46.060]   is finally after like two years,
[03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:50.280]   one day he swept Boris, got on top and finished him.
[03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:55.280]   And I remember that was one of his biggest thrills
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:13:57.640]   in all of his training career.
[03:13:57.640 --> 03:14:00.360]   - That was the last time that ever happened for him.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:01.380]   (Luke laughs)
[03:14:01.380 --> 03:14:04.820]   - No, Boris was, he was a very formidable man for that time.
[03:14:04.820 --> 03:14:06.420]   The funny thing about Boris is,
[03:14:06.420 --> 03:14:10.520]   every time we would have a conversation,
[03:14:10.520 --> 03:14:12.920]   he would say, "I'm only gonna do this sport
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:14.720]   "until I'm 40 years old,
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:16.120]   "and then I'm gonna stop."
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:18.760]   And I was like, "Why?
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:20.700]   "Why not be like a lifelong martial artist?
[03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:22.040]   "You got so good.
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:22.960]   "You're good at jiu-jitsu.
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:23.800]   "You've got great skills.
[03:14:23.800 --> 03:14:25.160]   "You've worked hard.
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:26.860]   "Why not just keep going?"
[03:14:26.860 --> 03:14:29.580]   He's like, "It's ridiculous for a man to train after 40.
[03:14:29.580 --> 03:14:31.060]   "There's no need."
[03:14:31.060 --> 03:14:32.620]   He never gave any reason for this.
[03:14:32.620 --> 03:14:34.660]   It was just ridiculous.
[03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:39.460]   So one day, now this is a guy who came in literally every day,
[03:14:39.460 --> 03:14:40.960]   6 a.m. every day.
[03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:45.300]   One day, he comes in, he comes up to me at the end of training
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:47.060]   and goes, "Hey, John, I just turned 40,
[03:14:47.060 --> 03:14:48.760]   "so I won't be seeing you again."
[03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:52.200]   And I thought, he's joking.
[03:14:52.200 --> 03:14:53.940]   So I'm like, "I'll see you tomorrow, Boris."
[03:14:53.940 --> 03:14:56.280]   He's like, "No, you won't," and walks off.
[03:14:56.280 --> 03:14:57.460]   - How gangster is that?
[03:14:57.460 --> 03:14:58.860]   - And then he never came back.
[03:14:58.860 --> 03:15:00.260]   I've never seen Boris since.
[03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:04.260]   He came in, was one of the best grapplers I ever saw,
[03:15:04.260 --> 03:15:08.620]   and that's it, buddy, I'm out.
[03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:09.980]   And to this day--
[03:15:09.980 --> 03:15:11.340]   - No one to walk away.
[03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:12.780]   - Yeah.
[03:15:12.780 --> 03:15:14.840]   I also got to hang out, got to meet,
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:16.960]   hang out with Ali Abdelaziz.
[03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:18.520]   He's a Hanzo Gracie black belt,
[03:15:18.520 --> 03:15:20.480]   fourth degree judo black belt,
[03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:23.400]   and friend and manager of Khabib Nurmagomedov,
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:28.080]   who's coming down to Austin soon,
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:29.240]   will do a podcast.
[03:15:29.240 --> 03:15:30.480]   Hopefully, he'll get on the mat
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:33.700]   and have a bit of brainstorm.
[03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:36.440]   Also, he's a manager and friend
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:38.040]   of many other amazing fighters.
[03:15:40.600 --> 03:15:42.640]   I really love the guy.
[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:47.600]   The loyalty, the fact that he looks for loyalty
[03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:49.880]   and has that close inner circle,
[03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:52.120]   and integrity and character in people,
[03:15:52.120 --> 03:15:52.960]   I really like them.
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:54.520]   I connect to them really quickly.
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:15:57.400]   But any fun stories about Ali?
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:15:58.400]   Did you train together?
[03:15:58.400 --> 03:15:59.840]   - Yes, he trained for many years
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:02.220]   in the basement of my classes.
[03:16:06.760 --> 03:16:10.960]   His story is one of the most unlikely stories.
[03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:12.860]   Like if someone wrote a movie plot
[03:16:12.860 --> 03:16:14.280]   about his life, it'd be like,
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:16.840]   it's absurd, it'd be thrown out the door in a second,
[03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:18.040]   and yet it all happened.
[03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:22.320]   You're absolutely correct.
[03:16:22.320 --> 03:16:26.800]   From the unlikeliest possible starts,
[03:16:26.800 --> 03:16:28.720]   created a situation where he's,
[03:16:28.720 --> 03:16:30.400]   I think it's incontestable now to say
[03:16:30.400 --> 03:16:32.360]   he's the most successful manager
[03:16:32.360 --> 03:16:33.720]   in mixed martial arts history.
[03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:36.480]   He has more champions under his care
[03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:39.680]   than anyone else I'm aware of.
[03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:42.360]   - And respected, and influential,
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:44.280]   so on all dimensions, yes.
[03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:46.560]   - Now, many people aren't aware of the fact
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:48.080]   that he was actually a very good Judo player.
[03:16:48.080 --> 03:16:49.360]   He had--
[03:16:49.360 --> 03:16:50.200]   - Jidoka first, yeah.
[03:16:50.200 --> 03:16:52.720]   - Yes, yeah, he had very good Nogi Judo.
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:57.160]   He had an excellent Harai Koshi,
[03:16:57.160 --> 03:16:58.600]   very good Tani Itoshi.
[03:16:58.600 --> 03:17:01.880]   And he threw many people
[03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:04.800]   who were highly credentialed wrestlers
[03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:08.120]   back in the basement, back in the glory days of MMA training.
[03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:11.440]   He was a good example of a guy
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:14.360]   who had very, very good Judo hips,
[03:17:14.360 --> 03:17:18.080]   and often used it to counter wrestling,
[03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:22.640]   and was a fine demonstrator of the idea that
[03:17:22.640 --> 03:17:27.680]   when Judo is adapted to Nogi gripping,
[03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:29.880]   it can provide a very effective foil
[03:17:29.880 --> 03:17:32.720]   to many of the standard forms of wrestling attack.
[03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:35.640]   And he would often use Uchimada to counter leg tackles,
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:38.680]   and do so in very, very spectacular fashion.
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:41.120]   - Well, what do you think about Khabib?
[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:45.280]   Is there something from just watching him,
[03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:47.480]   or is there something you can imagine
[03:17:47.480 --> 03:17:49.120]   if he comes down to the gym
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:51.680]   that you might learn from the way he moves,
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:53.320]   the way he approaches wrestling?
[03:17:53.320 --> 03:17:54.160]   - Oh, absolutely.
[03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:56.080]   He's one of the greatest combat athletes of all time.
[03:17:56.080 --> 03:17:57.680]   If you can't learn from someone like that,
[03:17:57.680 --> 03:17:58.800]   there's something wrong with you.
[03:17:58.800 --> 03:18:01.200]   - So he emphasizes control.
[03:18:01.200 --> 03:18:02.040]   - Yes, he does.
[03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:04.840]   And he's absolutely a master of exerting control.
[03:18:04.840 --> 03:18:11.640]   The amount of grappling control he was able to put over
[03:18:11.640 --> 03:18:14.520]   some of the most difficult people in the world to control
[03:18:14.520 --> 03:18:16.000]   was truly astounding.
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:18.120]   He beat people from every style.
[03:18:18.120 --> 03:18:19.960]   He beat wrestlers, he beat Jujutsu players,
[03:18:19.960 --> 03:18:21.420]   he beat kickboxers,
[03:18:21.420 --> 03:18:24.220]   and he controlled them all in more or less the same way.
[03:18:24.220 --> 03:18:27.800]   He has a very underrated bottom game.
[03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:30.800]   People think, "Oh, he's just about stifling top control."
[03:18:30.800 --> 03:18:33.920]   But people forget he was taken down on several occasions
[03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:35.480]   and ended up in bottom position.
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:38.600]   And he showed excellent guard work from bottom.
[03:18:38.600 --> 03:18:41.360]   He was able to get into submission holds readily
[03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:42.800]   on opponents from bottom position.
[03:18:42.800 --> 03:18:44.460]   He's got an excellent bottom game.
[03:18:44.460 --> 03:18:48.840]   People say, "Oh, he's just a positional guy."
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:49.680]   No, he's not.
[03:18:49.680 --> 03:18:50.800]   He's got great submissions.
[03:18:50.800 --> 03:18:53.680]   The application of his triangle from both top and bottom
[03:18:53.680 --> 03:18:54.880]   was top class.
[03:18:54.880 --> 03:18:58.400]   He had a sharp arm lock from bottom position.
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:18:59.240]   Excellent Kimura.
[03:18:59.240 --> 03:19:02.800]   If you look at his Kimura finishes in MMA,
[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:06.000]   they were technically very, very well set.
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:07.560]   Excellent breaking mechanics.
[03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:11.800]   He's a very, very fine grappler
[03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:15.040]   in both submission grappling and MMA grappling.
[03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:16.600]   I think we'd probably learn a ton
[03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:18.680]   from moving around with him.
[03:19:18.680 --> 03:19:23.440]   - Is it possible to learn something about him
[03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:26.240]   or about Haja Gracie or about Gordon
[03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:31.240]   by watching them or rolling around them for a little bit?
[03:19:31.240 --> 03:19:35.560]   So maybe Haja and Khabib are good examples
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:41.000]   because they're able to do seemingly very basic things
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:44.840]   on everybody and dominate them with that.
[03:19:44.840 --> 03:19:46.960]   I think Gordon is as well,
[03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:49.280]   but Gordon seems to have more preference
[03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:51.240]   and range of what he's able to do.
[03:19:51.240 --> 03:19:55.320]   It's just, it's almost miraculous how much Haja can do
[03:19:55.320 --> 03:20:00.320]   by just the same exact thing on everybody.
[03:20:00.320 --> 03:20:04.700]   Is that, is it possible to understand
[03:20:04.700 --> 03:20:08.560]   why Haja or Khabib are so good at very basic positions?
[03:20:08.560 --> 03:20:11.440]   Or do you have to feel it or do you have to,
[03:20:11.440 --> 03:20:13.400]   or is it just something that's developed
[03:20:13.400 --> 03:20:15.840]   over years and years and years?
[03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:17.360]   - I think for most people,
[03:20:17.360 --> 03:20:19.440]   for the vast majority of people,
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:21.800]   it would have to be explained to them.
[03:20:21.880 --> 03:20:24.280]   For a smaller group of people,
[03:20:24.280 --> 03:20:27.360]   if they felt it, they could try to replicate it.
[03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:29.440]   And there are a few people who could look at it
[03:20:29.440 --> 03:20:31.120]   and have enough knowledge and say,
[03:20:31.120 --> 03:20:33.240]   "Okay, I can see what he's doing."
[03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:37.120]   Like for example, Haja could probably look at video footage
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:38.400]   of Khabib grappling and say,
[03:20:38.400 --> 03:20:40.240]   "Okay, I understand what he's doing."
[03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:44.920]   But the average person would probably go over their heads.
[03:20:44.920 --> 03:20:48.100]   - You sometimes think of like these great athletes,
[03:20:48.100 --> 03:20:51.200]   like maybe they're too narrow.
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:54.520]   Like you might imagine they're kinda so focused
[03:20:54.520 --> 03:20:56.000]   on a particular thing,
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.120]   they don't develop in interesting ways.
[03:20:58.120 --> 03:20:59.240]   He's just a sweetheart.
[03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:01.600]   - Yeah, he's a wonderful person to be around.
[03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:04.040]   (laughing)
[03:21:04.040 --> 03:21:06.640]   - Yeah, he's also visiting Austin.
[03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:08.360]   But just, I was so, I mean, first of all,
[03:21:08.360 --> 03:21:12.160]   I'm honored just drinking a little bit too much
[03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:14.200]   in Vegas with Haja Gracie and just,
[03:21:14.200 --> 03:21:19.200]   and talking about love and relationships and life
[03:21:20.120 --> 03:21:23.040]   and death and all those philosophical topics
[03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:24.920]   as one does in Vegas.
[03:21:24.920 --> 03:21:26.640]   I'm a little bit too much to drink.
[03:21:26.640 --> 03:21:30.040]   Anyway, after ADCC, it was beautiful.
[03:21:30.040 --> 03:21:34.240]   And on top of that, hanging out with Rogan many days
[03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:36.240]   for UFC and then ADCC.
[03:21:36.240 --> 03:21:37.120]   You know, one thing,
[03:21:37.120 --> 03:21:38.720]   I don't know if you've gotten a chance to hang out
[03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:40.720]   with Joe when he plays pool.
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:45.800]   So I spent a lot of time with him when he was playing pool,
[03:21:45.800 --> 03:21:47.880]   like recently on that trip to Vegas.
[03:21:47.880 --> 03:21:51.920]   And there's something zen-like about,
[03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:53.600]   first of all, just watching him.
[03:21:53.600 --> 03:21:58.600]   But I've never seen the focus the guys got on the game
[03:21:58.600 --> 03:22:04.000]   for hours, just deep focus, unshakable focus.
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:07.320]   That was so interesting to watch,
[03:22:07.320 --> 03:22:09.880]   that this human being, he's a celebrity,
[03:22:09.880 --> 03:22:11.800]   he does all kinds of stuff,
[03:22:11.800 --> 03:22:16.800]   that he's able to allocate as close to 100% of his mind
[03:22:17.800 --> 03:22:20.840]   as I can imagine to a particular task
[03:22:20.840 --> 03:22:22.760]   and nothing can distract him.
[03:22:22.760 --> 03:22:23.800]   That was really inspiring,
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:27.560]   that you could still do that on any task.
[03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:29.520]   - Well, pool is a game of physics.
[03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:31.120]   That should be your domain.
[03:22:31.120 --> 03:22:33.440]   - Oh, it is, but that wasn't just physics.
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:36.440]   Yeah, I would think you understand the game,
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:38.920]   you understand the physics of it.
[03:22:38.920 --> 03:22:40.720]   You also understand the fun of it
[03:22:40.720 --> 03:22:42.960]   'cause there's friends and laughter and so on.
[03:22:42.960 --> 03:22:46.160]   I would be distracted by that a little bit.
[03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:48.160]   I wouldn't be as focused.
[03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:52.400]   He literally, the closer you get to the table,
[03:22:52.400 --> 03:22:54.600]   the more everything zooms in.
[03:22:54.600 --> 03:22:56.360]   The jokes, there's funny things,
[03:22:56.360 --> 03:22:58.280]   you can't get his attention on anything.
[03:22:58.280 --> 03:22:59.360]   It's that focus.
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:02.920]   I don't know, that really stayed with me.
[03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:07.420]   That those memes, like,
[03:23:07.420 --> 03:23:10.360]   I wanna find somebody that looks at me
[03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:12.680]   the way X looks at Y.
[03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:14.240]   I wanna find somebody that looks at me
[03:23:14.240 --> 03:23:16.600]   the way Joe looks at a pool cue or whatever.
[03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:19.720]   The focus there, I wanna find something in my life.
[03:23:19.720 --> 03:23:26.440]   Rather, I want to attain the level of focus he has
[03:23:26.440 --> 03:23:29.800]   for pool on a task that I care about.
[03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:33.000]   And that focus, like, fuck everything else.
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.620]   This is, now it's time to do work.
[03:23:35.620 --> 03:23:38.520]   I don't know, that was really inspiring.
[03:23:38.520 --> 03:23:40.120]   I haven't seen that kind of focus
[03:23:42.200 --> 03:23:45.240]   for prolonged periods of time on a task.
[03:23:45.240 --> 03:23:46.600]   You should see it sometime.
[03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:51.420]   I mean, part of it is just being competitive with himself.
[03:23:51.420 --> 03:23:53.080]   It's the hatred of imperfection,
[03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:54.400]   all of those kinds of elements,
[03:23:54.400 --> 03:23:57.400]   but embodied in a singular focus.
[03:23:57.400 --> 03:23:59.120]   - I had no idea he even played pool.
[03:23:59.120 --> 03:24:00.680]   It's interesting.
[03:24:00.680 --> 03:24:01.800]   - You should watch him.
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:05.760]   I think it could be one of his greatest obsessions.
[03:24:05.760 --> 03:24:09.000]   Like, there was deep,
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:11.920]   see, I thought pool is for, like, degenerates.
[03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:14.640]   Like gamblers and, like, hustlers, right?
[03:24:14.640 --> 03:24:18.040]   Like, the same way I see poker.
[03:24:18.040 --> 03:24:23.040]   But, like, I saw, like, a wolf slash, like,
[03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:25.360]   elite athlete in Joe.
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:26.280]   I said, I didn't know this.
[03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:27.640]   I don't know much about pool.
[03:24:27.640 --> 03:24:30.240]   I didn't know that you could have that level of focus
[03:24:30.240 --> 03:24:33.800]   while still drunk at your ass, but extremely focused.
[03:24:33.800 --> 03:24:34.960]   It was beautiful to see.
[03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:38.840]   I don't know, inspiring, inspiring for me
[03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:43.840]   as a person who highly values singular focus on a task.
[03:24:43.840 --> 03:24:46.280]   Let me ask you from a perspective of a hobbyist,
[03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:51.280]   what major practical changes can a hobbyist
[03:24:51.280 --> 03:24:53.240]   who works regular nine-to-five job
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:54.920]   do to improve their jiu-jitsu?
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:56.640]   So, they're in a gym.
[03:24:56.640 --> 03:24:58.080]   There's a lot of excellent gyms
[03:24:58.080 --> 03:24:59.080]   throughout the United States.
[03:24:59.080 --> 03:25:02.240]   What can they do to improve their jiu-jitsu?
[03:25:02.240 --> 03:25:04.760]   About the way they think about jiu-jitsu,
[03:25:04.760 --> 03:25:06.120]   about the way they approach,
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:08.000]   their actual schedule, those kinds of things.
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:09.320]   - That's a great question.
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:14.480]   Okay, the less training time you've got,
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:17.120]   the more you wanna maximize its effect.
[03:25:17.120 --> 03:25:19.640]   So, a question becomes, okay,
[03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:22.680]   if I'm training, say, twice a week,
[03:25:22.680 --> 03:25:25.120]   and sometimes even once a week,
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:27.160]   what can I do to make sure that
[03:25:27.160 --> 03:25:30.780]   that two-hour period is used maximally?
[03:25:30.780 --> 03:25:36.240]   The less training time you've got,
[03:25:36.240 --> 03:25:38.120]   the more the onus is on you
[03:25:38.120 --> 03:25:40.960]   to have a plan before you walk in the door.
[03:25:40.960 --> 03:25:43.960]   If you go in just saying,
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:46.800]   I'm gonna roll around and see what happens,
[03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:49.560]   or I'll just follow what the instructor says,
[03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:52.960]   you'll get a certain amount out of each class,
[03:25:52.960 --> 03:25:56.040]   but it will never be what it could have been.
[03:25:56.040 --> 03:26:00.600]   Go in with a plan and enact it.
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:04.140]   Many people go in with a plan and don't follow it.
[03:26:05.480 --> 03:26:06.860]   Let's say, for example,
[03:26:06.860 --> 03:26:13.480]   we start with a program that goes like this.
[03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:18.480]   First, try to create the most honest assessment
[03:26:18.480 --> 03:26:21.320]   of yourself as a jiu-jitsu player.
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:25.560]   It's tough to make an honest assessment of yourself
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:29.400]   because you never actually get to see your game.
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:32.120]   So, what I would recommend is to start
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:37.120]   by videotaping yourself in sparring with your peers.
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:41.120]   - That's fascinating 'cause we don't even have
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:44.240]   that level of introspection ability to reflect
[03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:47.120]   of what we actually look like in grappling.
[03:26:47.120 --> 03:26:49.000]   - Start with an assessment of yourself.
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.320]   And the most honest one comes not from you,
[03:26:51.320 --> 03:26:52.520]   it comes from the camera.
[03:26:52.520 --> 03:26:57.920]   Have a look at what you see and start to say,
[03:26:57.920 --> 03:27:02.920]   okay, many of the weaknesses in your game
[03:27:02.920 --> 03:27:06.560]   are made much more apparent by looking from the outside in
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:09.160]   rather than feeling them during the heat of a match.
[03:27:09.160 --> 03:27:15.360]   Identify four or five of the biggest weaknesses that you see
[03:27:15.360 --> 03:27:19.640]   and start actively attacking those weaknesses.
[03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:22.020]   Ask yourself, let's say, for example,
[03:27:22.020 --> 03:27:26.460]   in the course of watching the videotape of yourself,
[03:27:26.460 --> 03:27:30.120]   you observe yourself losing three triangles.
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:31.880]   You attempted three triangle strangleholds,
[03:27:31.880 --> 03:27:33.040]   you failed all three.
[03:27:33.040 --> 03:27:40.560]   You could start by saying, okay, let me ask myself,
[03:27:40.560 --> 03:27:44.520]   who are the people I look up to the most
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:46.920]   with regards a triangle strangle?
[03:27:46.920 --> 03:27:48.760]   Who are the guys who have the best
[03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:50.920]   triangle strangles out there?
[03:27:50.920 --> 03:27:54.720]   Then ask yourselves, of those people,
[03:27:54.720 --> 03:27:57.320]   who are the ones whose body type and personality
[03:27:57.320 --> 03:27:59.960]   most closely mirrors my own?
[03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:01.560]   And that would be a good example
[03:28:01.560 --> 03:28:06.080]   of taking a problem in your game,
[03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:09.360]   contrasting it with elite level performance
[03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:12.120]   in people whose body type roughly matches your own,
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:15.080]   and then try to take lessons you learn
[03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:17.120]   by observing the best people
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:21.080]   and bringing them into your own game in one specific area.
[03:28:21.080 --> 03:28:23.840]   As time goes by, you do this with more and more elements
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:27.560]   of your game, you will undoubtedly improve.
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:31.160]   You will also have to make sure that you take time
[03:28:31.160 --> 03:28:35.120]   during class to actively work on these things.
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:37.220]   Now, sometimes in class, you don't get a choice.
[03:28:37.220 --> 03:28:38.880]   The instructor sometimes says, okay,
[03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:41.020]   today we're working this, this, and this,
[03:28:41.020 --> 03:28:44.120]   but there's always time after and before class
[03:28:44.120 --> 03:28:45.680]   where you can do your own drilling,
[03:28:45.680 --> 03:28:47.440]   where you can make your own inquiries.
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:51.640]   And during sparring, there's no rigorous control
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:54.240]   over what you do, you can try to work the game
[03:28:54.240 --> 03:28:56.320]   into the area of focus.
[03:28:56.320 --> 03:28:59.360]   So for example, if you want to work on front triangles,
[03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:01.280]   it would be wise for you to do most of your sparring
[03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:03.960]   from bottom guard positions,
[03:29:03.960 --> 03:29:05.860]   that'll give you the most opportunity.
[03:29:05.860 --> 03:29:10.760]   And in this sense, it always begins with
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:15.560]   an accurate assessment of your current skill level.
[03:29:15.560 --> 03:29:16.720]   You gotta start there.
[03:29:16.720 --> 03:29:21.180]   Then, I always encourage people to use video camera
[03:29:21.180 --> 03:29:22.440]   to make the most--
[03:29:22.440 --> 03:29:23.280]   - Honest.
[03:29:23.280 --> 03:29:25.400]   - Honest appraisal you can,
[03:29:25.400 --> 03:29:28.440]   because your own mind is not dishonest,
[03:29:28.440 --> 03:29:32.200]   but it's understandably inaccurate.
[03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:34.320]   You tend to feel things rather than see them
[03:29:34.320 --> 03:29:35.960]   when you're performing jiu-jitsu.
[03:29:35.960 --> 03:29:41.720]   Then make a program for yourself
[03:29:41.720 --> 03:29:44.540]   based around what you see as excellence.
[03:29:44.540 --> 03:29:49.580]   Look at the people in the sport who's,
[03:29:49.580 --> 03:29:51.320]   in the area you wanna work on,
[03:29:51.320 --> 03:29:53.840]   people who are renowned for skill in that area.
[03:29:53.840 --> 03:29:57.120]   If possible, narrow it down to people
[03:29:57.120 --> 03:29:59.120]   who have excellence in that area
[03:29:59.120 --> 03:30:02.880]   and their body type corresponds with your own.
[03:30:02.880 --> 03:30:05.360]   And then try to take lessons learned
[03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:08.480]   from observing the excellence in these elite athletes
[03:30:08.480 --> 03:30:11.440]   and bring elements of them into your game.
[03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:16.080]   Never try to bring an elite athlete's entire game
[03:30:16.080 --> 03:30:17.160]   to your game.
[03:30:17.160 --> 03:30:19.820]   That will create an inauthentic game on your part,
[03:30:19.820 --> 03:30:21.860]   which will always be a poor copy
[03:30:21.860 --> 03:30:23.480]   of what you're trying to watch.
[03:30:23.480 --> 03:30:27.900]   Rather, bring very specific areas and skills that you see
[03:30:27.900 --> 03:30:30.820]   and import them from different people
[03:30:30.820 --> 03:30:34.240]   until eventually you find something for yourself.
[03:30:34.240 --> 03:30:37.320]   Experiment a lot, okay?
[03:30:37.320 --> 03:30:38.480]   Everyone's different.
[03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:42.540]   And so, you will, don't see the video research
[03:30:42.540 --> 03:30:44.340]   as the final word.
[03:30:44.340 --> 03:30:49.340]   See video research the way a writer will see a muse,
[03:30:49.340 --> 03:30:53.220]   as someone who initiates discussion,
[03:30:53.220 --> 03:30:56.280]   opens inquiries for your own research.
[03:30:56.280 --> 03:31:01.700]   The most powerful moments you will have on the mat
[03:31:01.700 --> 03:31:04.560]   come from making discoveries for yourself,
[03:31:04.560 --> 03:31:06.220]   not being told what to do,
[03:31:06.220 --> 03:31:08.440]   not observing someone else doing something,
[03:31:08.440 --> 03:31:10.340]   but self-discoveries.
[03:31:11.820 --> 03:31:14.780]   Those are the ones that will last inside you.
[03:31:14.780 --> 03:31:19.780]   So, use video research not as the definitive answer
[03:31:19.780 --> 03:31:23.300]   to your problems, but as initiating research
[03:31:23.300 --> 03:31:25.300]   for yourself on the mat.
[03:31:25.300 --> 03:31:28.020]   And as time goes by and you do this more and more often
[03:31:28.020 --> 03:31:29.780]   in more and more areas of the sport,
[03:31:29.780 --> 03:31:32.040]   I promise you, you'll improve.
[03:31:32.040 --> 03:31:35.400]   - Yeah, and I guess when you have the plan,
[03:31:35.400 --> 03:31:38.620]   have a plan that carries across many training sessions.
[03:31:38.620 --> 03:31:43.620]   So, I just remember, I know this is perhaps dumb,
[03:31:43.620 --> 03:31:47.740]   but I saw in my own game early on a lot of growth
[03:31:47.740 --> 03:31:51.860]   is by self-identifying a problem
[03:31:51.860 --> 03:31:54.860]   and coming up by myself with a solution
[03:31:54.860 --> 03:31:58.060]   by watching, in that case, Marcel Garcia.
[03:31:58.060 --> 03:32:01.860]   I just thought my butterfly guard was very weak.
[03:32:01.860 --> 03:32:04.660]   And so, I thought, okay, what's the solution here?
[03:32:04.660 --> 03:32:09.540]   I thought maybe this X guard thing, double X guard.
[03:32:09.540 --> 03:32:11.100]   Okay, so I watched a bunch of video.
[03:32:11.100 --> 03:32:12.300]   Let me try to work on this.
[03:32:12.300 --> 03:32:15.340]   And then all I did, just this is self,
[03:32:15.340 --> 03:32:19.580]   but when I could get down by myself,
[03:32:19.580 --> 03:32:22.360]   meaning not instructor-guided classes,
[03:32:22.360 --> 03:32:24.100]   but in training, I would just,
[03:32:24.100 --> 03:32:28.460]   everything I would put myself into butterfly and X guard.
[03:32:28.460 --> 03:32:29.300]   - That's good.
[03:32:29.300 --> 03:32:30.900]   - And then just let go.
[03:32:30.900 --> 03:32:32.180]   Don't progress.
[03:32:32.180 --> 03:32:34.640]   Sweep and figure out a way to get swept,
[03:32:34.640 --> 03:32:37.100]   to get right back to it, back to, and everything.
[03:32:37.100 --> 03:32:39.140]   It was annoying probably to train with me
[03:32:39.140 --> 03:32:40.180]   'cause that's all I did.
[03:32:40.180 --> 03:32:41.460]   And it's all I thought about.
[03:32:41.460 --> 03:32:42.540]   - I bet you learned quickly.
[03:32:42.540 --> 03:32:45.100]   - Yeah, I learned it's the most progress I've ever made.
[03:32:45.100 --> 03:32:48.100]   Now, you could say that X guard
[03:32:48.100 --> 03:32:50.240]   wasn't the right solution for me,
[03:32:50.240 --> 03:32:54.580]   that maybe that wasn't the weakest point for me to work on.
[03:32:54.580 --> 03:32:57.460]   If I were to look back now, it's still to this day, sadly,
[03:32:57.460 --> 03:33:01.260]   the obvious weakest point for me
[03:33:01.260 --> 03:33:04.020]   is escapes from much worse positions.
[03:33:04.720 --> 03:33:06.120]   That should be worked on.
[03:33:06.120 --> 03:33:08.160]   That should have been worked on from the very beginning.
[03:33:08.160 --> 03:33:09.760]   That's still, today, if I were to say
[03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:12.840]   what's the weakest thing that I should work on, absolutely,
[03:33:12.840 --> 03:33:17.840]   is even with one day a week is escapes.
[03:33:17.840 --> 03:33:21.080]   But yeah, a lot of that has to do with just
[03:33:21.080 --> 03:33:24.840]   carrying, focusing on the one thing
[03:33:24.840 --> 03:33:27.820]   over and over and over and over across training sessions.
[03:33:27.820 --> 03:33:32.000]   Now, it also, I would write down on a sheet of paper
[03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:34.680]   the number of times I would get an X guard sweep.
[03:33:34.680 --> 03:33:39.260]   And I would set a rule that I have to get
[03:33:39.260 --> 03:33:42.580]   whatever it was, like 500 sweeps a week.
[03:33:42.580 --> 03:33:44.980]   So I have to, and then the closer you get
[03:33:44.980 --> 03:33:47.740]   to the end of the week, the more you just pick up
[03:33:47.740 --> 03:33:49.820]   a small white belt. - 500 in a week?
[03:33:49.820 --> 03:33:51.180]   - Yeah, sometimes. - Your training partners
[03:33:51.180 --> 03:33:52.700]   must suck, bro.
[03:33:52.700 --> 03:33:55.460]   - No, you start with good ones,
[03:33:55.460 --> 03:33:58.020]   and then you get more and more desperate.
[03:33:58.020 --> 03:34:01.700]   You start finding the kid, right?
[03:34:01.700 --> 03:34:03.360]   You can just sweep over and over.
[03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:07.560]   But that number, for me, the numbers, for some reason,
[03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:10.420]   it set a goal to pull off a technique.
[03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:16.200]   It enforced, we're staying with this for a while.
[03:34:16.200 --> 03:34:17.360]   This is a journey we're doing.
[03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:21.840]   And for some reason, for me, that helped me focus the study
[03:34:21.840 --> 03:34:24.540]   to understand the deep complexities of this thing.
[03:34:24.540 --> 03:34:28.080]   At least for me, other people, nobody at the gym
[03:34:28.080 --> 03:34:30.160]   was doing X guard or anything of that,
[03:34:30.160 --> 03:34:32.940]   so you had to kind of figure everything out yourself.
[03:34:32.940 --> 03:34:35.340]   I'm sure there's better ways to do that,
[03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:40.000]   but at least that focus helps from a hobbyist perspective.
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:42.540]   What's the day, what's the perfect day
[03:34:42.540 --> 03:34:44.820]   in the life of John Donner?
[03:34:44.820 --> 03:34:47.560]   If we're talking about a basic non-ADCC,
[03:34:47.560 --> 03:34:53.180]   now, I'm really grateful that you sit down with me
[03:34:53.180 --> 03:34:57.220]   on a Sunday, late at night,
[03:34:57.220 --> 03:34:59.780]   but it all starts again for you tomorrow.
[03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:04.040]   So three training sessions a day.
[03:35:04.040 --> 03:35:06.680]   What time do you wake up?
[03:35:06.680 --> 03:35:08.440]   Do you do a mantra in the morning?
[03:35:08.440 --> 03:35:14.160]   Do you listen to some Zen music?
[03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:15.840]   What do you eat in the morning?
[03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:17.800]   What's the perfect day look like?
[03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:21.000]   You sacrifice a small animal.
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:23.840]   - To the gods.
[03:35:26.580 --> 03:35:30.700]   Usually, when you say a perfect day,
[03:35:30.700 --> 03:35:33.260]   what I think you really mean is an average day.
[03:35:33.260 --> 03:35:35.020]   - Perfectly productive average day.
[03:35:35.020 --> 03:35:36.060]   - Yeah.
[03:35:36.060 --> 03:35:38.300]   So let's take Monday morning.
[03:35:38.300 --> 03:35:41.460]   For you watching this video,
[03:35:41.460 --> 03:35:43.500]   we're filming this late on a Sunday night,
[03:35:43.500 --> 03:35:46.580]   so after this, I'll drive home.
[03:35:46.580 --> 03:35:50.340]   We just had ADCC.
[03:35:50.340 --> 03:35:52.380]   It was two weeks ago.
[03:35:52.380 --> 03:35:55.740]   It was one of the longest training camps.
[03:35:55.740 --> 03:35:57.640]   It was the longest training camp I've ever run
[03:35:57.640 --> 03:35:59.400]   because of the fact that we had to go through
[03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:02.200]   three different matches for Gordon-Ryan leading up to it.
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:07.020]   So immediately after ADCC,
[03:36:07.020 --> 03:36:09.640]   I cut the training down for the competitive athletes
[03:36:09.640 --> 03:36:14.100]   to one session per day for the first week after ADCC
[03:36:14.100 --> 03:36:16.480]   to give their bodies a bit of a break.
[03:36:16.480 --> 03:36:20.040]   I still have to teach two classes in addition to that,
[03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:22.000]   two recreational classes,
[03:36:22.080 --> 03:36:26.840]   so my teaching schedule went down to three classes per day.
[03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:31.080]   After one week of relative break,
[03:36:31.080 --> 03:36:35.120]   we go back to two competition classes per day
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:37.200]   plus two recreational classes
[03:36:37.200 --> 03:36:41.200]   plus an MMA class for Gary Tonin and his friends.
[03:36:41.200 --> 03:36:49.160]   The first class requires me to get up around 6 a.m.
[03:36:49.680 --> 03:36:51.840]   to drive.
[03:36:51.840 --> 03:36:53.640]   I'm still a student driver,
[03:36:53.640 --> 03:36:55.840]   so I'm not very good at driving,
[03:36:55.840 --> 03:36:57.640]   so I have to spend a little extra time
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:36:59.880]   to get to the destination on time.
[03:36:59.880 --> 03:37:00.840]   Just for the record,
[03:37:00.840 --> 03:37:05.840]   John pulled in in a red Lamborghini with a, no.
[03:37:05.840 --> 03:37:08.720]   You're the worst liar I've ever met.
[03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:12.160]   My day typically starts pretty early.
[03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:13.840]   I don't eat in the morning.
[03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:16.120]   I just get up and go to work,
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:18.220]   and I teach through the day.
[03:37:19.120 --> 03:37:21.880]   My last class finishes usually around 8 p.m.
[03:37:21.880 --> 03:37:24.400]   During that time,
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:29.200]   I coach jujitsu.
[03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:32.960]   I try to find time for one Instagram post per day,
[03:37:32.960 --> 03:37:37.200]   which usually describes some basic theme of jujitsu
[03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:38.480]   in most cases,
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:40.360]   unless we've just had a competition,
[03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:42.560]   in which case I'll talk about upcoming competitions
[03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:44.680]   or what happens after a competition,
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:47.720]   but most of them just express a simple jujitsu theme.
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:52.380]   I try to do a short workout for myself,
[03:37:52.380 --> 03:37:56.960]   and then I go home.
[03:37:56.960 --> 03:37:57.840]   At the end of the day,
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:00.040]   I always start by asking myself,
[03:38:00.040 --> 03:38:02.240]   what do my students need from me tomorrow,
[03:38:02.240 --> 03:38:03.920]   based on what I've seen today?
[03:38:03.920 --> 03:38:05.920]   What do the recreational students need,
[03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:08.040]   and what do the competitive students need?
[03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:11.840]   This is always done in the light of
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:15.400]   what are the upcoming competitions.
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:16.220]   But throughout the day,
[03:38:16.220 --> 03:38:20.560]   you're doing a lot of really in-depth classes.
[03:38:20.560 --> 03:38:22.540]   So how do you either prepare for them
[03:38:22.540 --> 03:38:24.620]   or think through them as they're happening?
[03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:29.180]   Think through the material that you're teaching.
[03:38:29.180 --> 03:38:30.620]   - I can look at a class.
[03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:31.680]   I've been doing this a long time,
[03:38:31.680 --> 03:38:33.460]   so I can just look at a class and be like,
[03:38:33.460 --> 03:38:35.540]   okay, these guys need this, this, and this.
[03:38:35.540 --> 03:38:38.220]   And then I make reflections at the end of the day.
[03:38:38.220 --> 03:38:41.740]   Then I'll take care of things that we all do,
[03:38:41.740 --> 03:38:43.180]   talk to family,
[03:38:43.180 --> 03:38:46.680]   occasionally go out for dinner with friends,
[03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:50.380]   dates, things like that.
[03:38:50.380 --> 03:38:52.020]   - Yeah, Hanzo had to really harass you,
[03:38:52.020 --> 03:38:54.900]   to drag you out and to hang out,
[03:38:54.900 --> 03:38:56.940]   and he was very convincing.
[03:38:56.940 --> 03:38:58.340]   And food-wise?
[03:38:58.340 --> 03:38:59.340]   - I eat once a day.
[03:38:59.340 --> 03:39:00.180]   - Eat once a day.
[03:39:00.180 --> 03:39:01.020]   - Yeah, at the end of the day,
[03:39:01.020 --> 03:39:04.220]   I usually stop off at a place like a supermarket,
[03:39:04.220 --> 03:39:06.860]   like Whole Foods or some equivalent to that,
[03:39:06.860 --> 03:39:08.540]   and buy something simple and eat.
[03:39:11.100 --> 03:39:13.700]   - The internet wants to know the details.
[03:39:13.700 --> 03:39:16.700]   Did you end up getting wifi for your apartment?
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:18.260]   - No.
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:19.660]   I'm still thinking about it.
[03:39:19.660 --> 03:39:20.500]   - So, yeah.
[03:39:20.500 --> 03:39:23.380]   - Yeah, so what are the pros and cons?
[03:39:23.380 --> 03:39:26.420]   - There's no cons, lots of pros,
[03:39:26.420 --> 03:39:30.500]   but I just don't put much importance to it.
[03:39:30.500 --> 03:39:32.340]   Things that are unimportant, I just ignore.
[03:39:32.340 --> 03:39:33.540]   - Yeah, there's a lot of things in life
[03:39:33.540 --> 03:39:34.460]   that have a lot of pros,
[03:39:34.460 --> 03:39:36.300]   but they're lower on the priority list.
[03:39:36.300 --> 03:39:37.340]   Why?
[03:39:37.340 --> 03:39:39.380]   Why, 'cause the 5G already--
[03:39:39.380 --> 03:39:40.680]   - 5G's got it covered.
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:43.040]   Do you watch much video?
[03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:44.360]   Do you watch video?
[03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:46.120]   Do you watch footage?
[03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:48.240]   - Video footage, quite often, yeah.
[03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:51.560]   Especially things from freestyle wrestling,
[03:39:51.560 --> 03:39:56.360]   Greco-Roman wrestling, judo, and mixed martial arts.
[03:39:56.360 --> 03:39:59.880]   Also, subsidiary sports to mixed martial arts,
[03:39:59.880 --> 03:40:03.560]   like boxing, Muay Thai, and European kickboxing.
[03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:05.880]   - Just for long-term idea generation?
[03:40:05.880 --> 03:40:07.080]   - Yes.
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:09.520]   - Like a plant, a seed, an idea?
[03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:10.720]   - Yeah, this is an interesting thing.
[03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:12.560]   How could this be incorporated in the context
[03:40:12.560 --> 03:40:14.520]   in which we use it, MMA or Jiu-Jitsu?
[03:40:14.520 --> 03:40:18.200]   - Maybe it's immediately obvious,
[03:40:18.200 --> 03:40:21.880]   or it might become obvious in a few weeks or months.
[03:40:21.880 --> 03:40:26.720]   Is there some aspect to the way you approach life
[03:40:26.720 --> 03:40:28.880]   and training and martial arts
[03:40:28.880 --> 03:40:31.360]   that amends itself to minimalism?
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:34.600]   It seems like you live a pretty stoic life.
[03:40:34.600 --> 03:40:37.800]   Or is that just a symptom of a focused existence?
[03:40:37.800 --> 03:40:39.320]   - My life wasn't always like this.
[03:40:39.320 --> 03:40:41.400]   I've gone through different phases in my life.
[03:40:41.400 --> 03:40:44.960]   I was a university student and teacher at university.
[03:40:44.960 --> 03:40:48.840]   I was a nightclub bouncer for more than a decade.
[03:40:48.840 --> 03:40:51.520]   I've been through different areas of life.
[03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:54.120]   I've seen most things, I've experienced a lot.
[03:40:54.120 --> 03:40:55.360]   I've traveled the world.
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:40:58.440]   At this point in my life,
[03:40:58.440 --> 03:41:01.120]   people think I live some kind of monk-like existence.
[03:41:01.120 --> 03:41:05.680]   I have a private life.
[03:41:05.680 --> 03:41:08.600]   I like to go out and have fun like everyone else.
[03:41:09.560 --> 03:41:14.560]   I'm not some kind of monk who just sits under a waterfall
[03:41:14.560 --> 03:41:16.400]   and meditates or anything crazy like that.
[03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:18.360]   - Well, that's why I'm currently going
[03:41:18.360 --> 03:41:21.280]   through that stage of my life, the monk-like existence.
[03:41:21.280 --> 03:41:24.160]   So I would be amiss not to ask you
[03:41:24.160 --> 03:41:26.480]   one of the most important questions
[03:41:26.480 --> 03:41:30.000]   one can possibly ask John Donaher,
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:32.640]   which is on the topic of animal combat.
[03:41:32.640 --> 03:41:36.240]   Who wins in a fight to the death?
[03:41:37.560 --> 03:41:40.200]   Or maybe in a sport competition setting,
[03:41:40.200 --> 03:41:42.080]   but let's go with a fight to the death.
[03:41:42.080 --> 03:41:46.480]   A grizzly bear, a silverback gorilla,
[03:41:46.480 --> 03:41:50.360]   and maybe a lion or a tiger, an African lion,
[03:41:50.360 --> 03:41:53.880]   or one of the flavors of tiger.
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:41:56.000]   I don't know who you think is more ferocious.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:41:57.960]   What are the parameters to consider here?
[03:41:57.960 --> 03:41:59.560]   Maybe I can throw a few out.
[03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:02.760]   Maybe you can give me some thoughts
[03:42:02.760 --> 03:42:05.320]   about how much of these parameters matter.
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:06.880]   So first of all, intelligence.
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:12.200]   I do believe the gorilla is the most intelligent.
[03:42:12.200 --> 03:42:15.240]   I did research for this, as you could imagine.
[03:42:15.240 --> 03:42:20.000]   - Solo or with Joe Rogan?
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:25.920]   - The expert advisor to this very podcast
[03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:29.160]   on this very topic is indeed Joe Rogan, yes.
[03:42:29.160 --> 03:42:32.200]   So in captivity, gorillas have been documented
[03:42:32.200 --> 03:42:35.880]   to show complex emotions, form family bonds,
[03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:39.000]   the ability to use tools,
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:43.120]   and to be able to reason about the past and the future.
[03:42:43.120 --> 03:42:43.940]   - That's impressive.
[03:42:43.940 --> 03:42:46.780]   - So that's something that, at least in captivity,
[03:42:46.780 --> 03:42:48.760]   the other animals have not been able to do.
[03:42:48.760 --> 03:42:51.240]   - They already sound much more advanced than I am.
[03:42:51.240 --> 03:42:54.520]   (Lex laughing)
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:42:58.040]   - Yeah, so that's intelligence.
[03:42:58.040 --> 03:43:00.680]   Then there is weight.
[03:43:00.680 --> 03:43:03.280]   I think that's something that you think of at first.
[03:43:04.320 --> 03:43:06.400]   The lion, let's go with the big ones.
[03:43:06.400 --> 03:43:09.440]   I took notes here, 550 pounds for a big lion.
[03:43:09.440 --> 03:43:11.040]   - That's exceptionally large.
[03:43:11.040 --> 03:43:13.440]   Most male lions are around 450 pounds.
[03:43:13.440 --> 03:43:15.040]   That's an exceptional beast then.
[03:43:15.040 --> 03:43:17.160]   (Lex laughing)
[03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:18.000]   - Thank you.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:20.600]   The tiger can be larger than that.
[03:43:20.600 --> 03:43:22.800]   - Yeah, much, much larger.
[03:43:22.800 --> 03:43:24.120]   - So we got the grizzly bear,
[03:43:24.120 --> 03:43:26.960]   which is probably the biggest of the bunch.
[03:43:26.960 --> 03:43:30.120]   The large ones get to 1,500 pounds.
[03:43:30.120 --> 03:43:31.560]   Correct me if some of this numbers--
[03:43:31.560 --> 03:43:35.160]   - I believe most grizzlies are around 1,000 pound mark.
[03:43:35.160 --> 03:43:36.560]   It's a big, big beast.
[03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:38.280]   - Well, I was looking up the biggest,
[03:43:38.280 --> 03:43:40.800]   but I didn't wanna do the biggest ever.
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:43.760]   Just what are the big, like the top of the range,
[03:43:43.760 --> 03:43:45.240]   'cause there's always a range.
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:47.200]   - You can put it in at roughly double
[03:43:47.200 --> 03:43:49.680]   that of even a very big lion.
[03:43:49.680 --> 03:43:53.200]   - Of course, how that weight is used is very important.
[03:43:53.200 --> 03:43:55.680]   So there's also things which I find as interesting
[03:43:55.680 --> 03:43:57.960]   as anaconda, which just, let me throw that in there,
[03:43:57.960 --> 03:44:00.680]   because it's 200 pounds.
[03:44:00.680 --> 03:44:03.960]   What I really like about that is it's not just the weight,
[03:44:03.960 --> 03:44:05.440]   it's the form factor.
[03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:07.480]   And I think out of all of these,
[03:44:07.480 --> 03:44:12.040]   the anaconda is the most non-standard form factor.
[03:44:12.040 --> 03:44:13.440]   - I totally agree with that.
[03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:17.000]   It's like the knight on the chessboard.
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:19.160]   It comes in from a completely different angle.
[03:44:19.160 --> 03:44:20.000]   - So we got that.
[03:44:20.000 --> 03:44:25.000]   We got also strength, which could be measured
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.520]   in ability to carry stuff.
[03:44:27.520 --> 03:44:29.620]   So this was surprising to me.
[03:44:29.620 --> 03:44:31.520]   I did look into this carefully.
[03:44:31.520 --> 03:44:34.440]   The grizzly bear at 1,000 or 1,500 pounds
[03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:38.600]   can only carry at most its body weight, which is a lot.
[03:44:38.600 --> 03:44:43.040]   But a gorilla can carry 10 times its body weight.
[03:44:43.040 --> 03:44:46.000]   A gorilla can lift over 2,000 kilograms,
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:48.680]   so that's over 4,000 pounds.
[03:44:48.680 --> 03:44:50.680]   - And gorillas themselves, an adult male,
[03:44:50.680 --> 03:44:52.880]   weighs in around 350 to 400.
[03:44:52.880 --> 03:44:54.720]   - 400 pounds, yes.
[03:44:54.720 --> 03:44:57.220]   So I like how in this particular place
[03:44:57.220 --> 03:44:59.920]   where I found this, 2,000 kilograms
[03:44:59.920 --> 03:45:02.800]   is as heavy as 30 average humans.
[03:45:02.800 --> 03:45:05.640]   So a gorilla can carry 30 humans.
[03:45:05.640 --> 03:45:07.040]   So that's carrying strength.
[03:45:07.040 --> 03:45:10.120]   And then of course, bite force,
[03:45:10.120 --> 03:45:12.880]   'cause that's one of the weapons in question here.
[03:45:12.880 --> 03:45:15.400]   So now this is really surprising to me.
[03:45:15.400 --> 03:45:19.260]   The gorilla has won me over through this, by the way.
[03:45:19.260 --> 03:45:21.200]   Intelligence, I'm a sucker for intelligence,
[03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:24.380]   but the gorilla bite force is the highest of all these,
[03:45:24.380 --> 03:45:28.300]   with 1,300 PSI, bear is second with 1,200 PSI,
[03:45:28.300 --> 03:45:33.280]   tiger is a third, I think tiger and lion
[03:45:33.280 --> 03:45:35.840]   is third with 1,000 PSI, it's comparable.
[03:45:35.840 --> 03:45:40.500]   And a bear is anywhere from 900 to 1,000 PSI.
[03:45:40.500 --> 03:45:42.880]   They're close, but gorilla, I would not have expected.
[03:45:42.880 --> 03:45:45.320]   Now, gorilla is not a carnivore,
[03:45:45.320 --> 03:45:49.820]   but apparently it chews, it mostly eats grassy stuff.
[03:45:49.820 --> 03:45:52.080]   But like--
[03:45:52.080 --> 03:45:53.200]   - It's difficult to explain
[03:45:53.200 --> 03:45:54.960]   why it has such a powerful bite.
[03:45:54.960 --> 03:45:57.680]   And it also, of course, has very large incisor teeth,
[03:45:57.680 --> 03:45:59.480]   as well as chewing teeth.
[03:45:59.480 --> 03:46:00.440]   So--
[03:46:00.440 --> 03:46:02.400]   - Also, no neck.
[03:46:02.400 --> 03:46:03.960]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[03:46:03.960 --> 03:46:04.800]   - So--
[03:46:04.800 --> 03:46:06.240]   - Its neck begins at the top of its head
[03:46:06.240 --> 03:46:07.520]   and this goes down to the shoulders.
[03:46:07.520 --> 03:46:10.280]   - Well, a lot of the way they use their teeth,
[03:46:10.280 --> 03:46:14.100]   all of these animals, the ultimate kill
[03:46:14.100 --> 03:46:16.160]   is to go for the neck, the bite on the neck.
[03:46:16.160 --> 03:46:21.160]   I don't know exactly why that is, probably has to do,
[03:46:21.160 --> 03:46:22.020]   why is that?
[03:46:22.020 --> 03:46:23.440]   - It's a very strong, controlled position,
[03:46:23.440 --> 03:46:24.640]   not just that it's a,
[03:46:24.640 --> 03:46:27.320]   is it the same as jiu-jitsu, you think?
[03:46:27.320 --> 03:46:28.560]   'Cause they get to also choke 'em out?
[03:46:28.560 --> 03:46:30.880]   - It's very much in line with jiu-jitsu.
[03:46:30.880 --> 03:46:32.720]   Lions are famous for using strangulation
[03:46:32.720 --> 03:46:34.040]   as their primary method of killing.
[03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:35.760]   They get a hold of the neck
[03:46:35.760 --> 03:46:38.480]   and hold it until the animal drops.
[03:46:38.480 --> 03:46:41.320]   - Plus, claws.
[03:46:41.320 --> 03:46:44.920]   I believe the tiger and the bear use their claws.
[03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:45.960]   - And the lion, too.
[03:46:45.960 --> 03:46:47.760]   - The lion, right, and the lion.
[03:46:49.420 --> 03:46:53.420]   This is something that the gorilla doesn't do
[03:46:53.420 --> 03:46:56.340]   and a conda, obviously, doesn't do.
[03:46:56.340 --> 03:46:57.500]   It's a different approach.
[03:46:57.500 --> 03:47:00.180]   So what do you think, how do we think about this?
[03:47:00.180 --> 03:47:02.900]   Also, there is, I'm just not letting you talk, apparently,
[03:47:02.900 --> 03:47:06.900]   there's levels of aggression in terms of--
[03:47:06.900 --> 03:47:09.740]   - These are also very important considerations.
[03:47:09.740 --> 03:47:11.020]   - What is important to you?
[03:47:11.020 --> 03:47:13.860]   - All the considerations you've raised are very important
[03:47:13.860 --> 03:47:16.140]   and we would have to address them
[03:47:16.140 --> 03:47:18.580]   if we're gonna go through this topic.
[03:47:18.580 --> 03:47:19.860]   First things first,
[03:47:19.860 --> 03:47:24.380]   whenever you go into a discussion of this kind,
[03:47:24.380 --> 03:47:29.380]   there's a kind of natural impression that we all have
[03:47:29.380 --> 03:47:32.700]   as to which one would be the most formidable.
[03:47:32.700 --> 03:47:38.980]   And it's important that you become rather skeptical
[03:47:38.980 --> 03:47:41.280]   of your first intuitions
[03:47:41.280 --> 03:47:43.180]   because they're often very misleading.
[03:47:43.180 --> 03:47:47.060]   Just as every boy thinks his father
[03:47:47.060 --> 03:47:49.340]   is the strongest man in the world
[03:47:49.340 --> 03:47:50.780]   and then when he grows up into adulthood,
[03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:54.140]   he realizes his father was not even close
[03:47:54.140 --> 03:47:55.780]   to being the strongest man in the world.
[03:47:55.780 --> 03:47:59.580]   It's not because of anything other than inexperience.
[03:47:59.580 --> 03:48:01.780]   To a boy, his father seems overwhelmingly strong.
[03:48:01.780 --> 03:48:03.340]   He literally can't even imagine
[03:48:03.340 --> 03:48:06.140]   anyone else being stronger than that.
[03:48:06.140 --> 03:48:08.900]   So naively, he thinks his father
[03:48:08.900 --> 03:48:10.860]   is the strongest man in the world.
[03:48:10.860 --> 03:48:14.220]   So too in our relationship with animals.
[03:48:14.220 --> 03:48:16.740]   When we look at a silverback gorilla,
[03:48:16.740 --> 03:48:21.180]   it just looks overwhelmingly strong to us
[03:48:21.180 --> 03:48:22.940]   to a degree which is almost absurd.
[03:48:22.940 --> 03:48:27.420]   You picture the greatest combat athletes
[03:48:27.420 --> 03:48:29.740]   that humanity has ever produced.
[03:48:29.740 --> 03:48:33.100]   Prime Mike Tyson, Gordon Ryan for grappling.
[03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:35.780]   They would literally be torn limb from limb
[03:48:35.780 --> 03:48:36.780]   by an angry gorilla.
[03:48:36.780 --> 03:48:39.820]   It wouldn't even be remotely competitive.
[03:48:39.820 --> 03:48:42.100]   And so there's a sense in which we look at them in awe
[03:48:42.100 --> 03:48:44.460]   because of what they could do to us.
[03:48:44.460 --> 03:48:46.940]   But that can be very misleading.
[03:48:46.940 --> 03:48:50.580]   And just as a boy looks at his father
[03:48:50.580 --> 03:48:52.980]   as like the pinnacle of strength,
[03:48:52.980 --> 03:48:55.260]   you can't necessarily from a position
[03:48:55.260 --> 03:48:57.620]   of inexperience and weakness look at a given animal
[03:48:57.620 --> 03:48:59.540]   and say, "Oh, that must be the toughest animal
[03:48:59.540 --> 03:49:00.740]   "in the animal kingdom."
[03:49:00.740 --> 03:49:02.660]   There's levels to this game.
[03:49:02.660 --> 03:49:06.500]   And I think we can point out that the gorilla
[03:49:06.500 --> 03:49:09.860]   ultimately would be pretty low on those levels
[03:49:09.860 --> 03:49:10.700]   despite the fearsome appearance.
[03:49:10.700 --> 03:49:13.700]   - I have some pushback to this analysis
[03:49:13.700 --> 03:49:16.940]   because the data, we don't have much data on this.
[03:49:16.940 --> 03:49:17.780]   We don't have--
[03:49:17.780 --> 03:49:19.780]   - We actually have slightly more than you think, I believe.
[03:49:19.780 --> 03:49:21.140]   - Oh boy.
[03:49:21.140 --> 03:49:22.540]   Well, it's anecdotal.
[03:49:22.540 --> 03:49:23.700]   I feel like it's out of context.
[03:49:23.700 --> 03:49:26.620]   So these species don't use, this is not MMA.
[03:49:26.620 --> 03:49:29.740]   They don't do interspecies fighting often.
[03:49:29.740 --> 03:49:31.740]   - Yeah, but there are some ways of looking at this
[03:49:31.740 --> 03:49:34.900]   which can take this already interesting question
[03:49:34.900 --> 03:49:36.660]   and make it a lot more interesting.
[03:49:36.660 --> 03:49:42.660]   First, we've seen that intuitions aren't to be trusted.
[03:49:42.660 --> 03:49:44.540]   So if intuitions aren't to be trusted,
[03:49:44.540 --> 03:49:46.460]   well, what is to be trusted here?
[03:49:46.460 --> 03:49:49.260]   Well, I've always believed that there are three
[03:49:49.260 --> 03:49:55.700]   general elements that determine what level of success
[03:49:55.700 --> 03:50:00.660]   or failure anyone will experience in combat.
[03:50:00.660 --> 03:50:04.020]   And this is true both for individuals and for groups
[03:50:04.020 --> 03:50:05.860]   and even all the way up to nations.
[03:50:05.860 --> 03:50:12.380]   The first is what are your skills?
[03:50:12.380 --> 03:50:15.780]   The second is what are your physical and mental attributes?
[03:50:15.780 --> 03:50:17.780]   So it's skills, attributes.
[03:50:17.780 --> 03:50:19.660]   Those are the two primary ones.
[03:50:19.660 --> 03:50:23.620]   And there's the third, which is your experience
[03:50:23.620 --> 03:50:26.180]   in using those skills and attributes
[03:50:26.180 --> 03:50:27.780]   in real world scenarios.
[03:50:27.780 --> 03:50:31.260]   So whenever two, we'll start with two humans.
[03:50:31.260 --> 03:50:33.660]   When two humans get into a fight, ask yourself,
[03:50:33.660 --> 03:50:35.300]   what is their skill set?
[03:50:35.300 --> 03:50:38.820]   What are their physical and mental attributes?
[03:50:38.820 --> 03:50:41.180]   And what is their experience
[03:50:41.180 --> 03:50:44.060]   in using those in real world applications?
[03:50:44.060 --> 03:50:48.420]   And that will give you your first look at,
[03:50:48.420 --> 03:50:50.500]   okay, who's gonna be the more successful?
[03:50:50.500 --> 03:50:55.700]   Then in addition to those three general elements,
[03:50:55.700 --> 03:50:58.580]   there's also four more specific elements.
[03:50:58.580 --> 03:51:06.620]   What is the ability of the combatants to initiate combat?
[03:51:06.620 --> 03:51:10.420]   Because initiation is a big deal in fighting.
[03:51:10.420 --> 03:51:12.900]   The one who sees the enemy first
[03:51:12.900 --> 03:51:15.380]   and can create ambush conditions
[03:51:15.380 --> 03:51:20.380]   or initiate combat in an area or a terrain
[03:51:20.380 --> 03:51:22.220]   which is favorable to them,
[03:51:22.220 --> 03:51:26.180]   this is huge in determining the outcome of battles.
[03:51:26.180 --> 03:51:30.780]   Second, not only is initiation important,
[03:51:30.780 --> 03:51:32.500]   but disengagement is important.
[03:51:32.500 --> 03:51:34.500]   A lot of battles don't go according to plan.
[03:51:34.500 --> 03:51:37.180]   And so your ability to disengage at will
[03:51:37.180 --> 03:51:42.100]   and break off and away from a battle is key to success.
[03:51:42.100 --> 03:51:45.620]   So initiation and disengagement are big.
[03:51:45.620 --> 03:51:48.820]   The third big element,
[03:51:48.820 --> 03:51:52.300]   what is your ability to end a fight?
[03:51:52.300 --> 03:51:55.800]   Okay, do you have an efficient method of ending conflict?
[03:51:55.800 --> 03:52:00.100]   Without that, the conflict could go on to a point
[03:52:00.100 --> 03:52:04.500]   where you no longer have the ability to continue it.
[03:52:04.500 --> 03:52:08.420]   If you have some succinct method of finishing,
[03:52:08.420 --> 03:52:12.100]   this is huge in combat in determining winner or loser.
[03:52:12.100 --> 03:52:14.020]   - So both from a winning and a losing position?
[03:52:14.020 --> 03:52:15.020]   - Yes, if you don't have one,
[03:52:15.020 --> 03:52:16.860]   there's a much higher chance you'll lose.
[03:52:16.860 --> 03:52:19.180]   But if you have an ability to finish an opponent
[03:52:19.180 --> 03:52:21.900]   in the conflict reliably,
[03:52:21.900 --> 03:52:24.540]   this is very, very important
[03:52:24.540 --> 03:52:26.940]   in determining success or failure.
[03:52:26.940 --> 03:52:30.060]   And third is your ability to endure a conflict
[03:52:30.060 --> 03:52:33.020]   longer than the person you're engaged in,
[03:52:33.020 --> 03:52:35.180]   okay, engaged with, sorry.
[03:52:35.180 --> 03:52:38.660]   And so you get these four more specific elements now.
[03:52:38.660 --> 03:52:42.180]   Do you have the ability to initiate contact at will?
[03:52:42.180 --> 03:52:44.440]   Do you have the ability to break contact
[03:52:44.440 --> 03:52:45.820]   and disengage at will?
[03:52:45.820 --> 03:52:50.980]   Do you have the ability to finish your opponent efficiently?
[03:52:50.980 --> 03:52:52.820]   And do you have the ability to endure
[03:52:52.820 --> 03:52:54.260]   longer than your opponent does?
[03:52:54.260 --> 03:52:59.140]   If you have all four of those, that's huge for combat.
[03:52:59.140 --> 03:53:02.060]   - That probably applies to human on human.
[03:53:02.060 --> 03:53:02.900]   - Everything.
[03:53:02.900 --> 03:53:04.220]   - Very conflict. - Across everything.
[03:53:04.220 --> 03:53:05.780]   Even all the way up to nations.
[03:53:05.780 --> 03:53:09.060]   Also ask yourself,
[03:53:09.060 --> 03:53:13.020]   what are the most efficient
[03:53:13.020 --> 03:53:17.820]   methods of combat
[03:53:17.820 --> 03:53:21.700]   across the globe, across all species,
[03:53:21.700 --> 03:53:23.780]   all times, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:53:23.780 --> 03:53:25.860]   And you will see that ultimately
[03:53:25.860 --> 03:53:28.300]   they always come down to
[03:53:28.300 --> 03:53:31.320]   three things.
[03:53:32.160 --> 03:53:35.160]   The first is concentration of force.
[03:53:35.160 --> 03:53:39.840]   Okay, one of the most successful combat strategies
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:43.720]   of all time is the ability to take concentrated force
[03:53:43.720 --> 03:53:46.520]   against the zone of weakness in your opponent.
[03:53:46.520 --> 03:53:47.720]   And if you can do this,
[03:53:47.720 --> 03:53:51.440]   you will often break through to a point of vulnerability,
[03:53:51.440 --> 03:53:52.960]   attack that vulnerability in a way
[03:53:52.960 --> 03:53:54.840]   where your opponent cannot respond
[03:53:54.840 --> 03:53:57.600]   and cannot recover from that vulnerable point being broken.
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:00.160]   - Do a high amount of damage with precision.
[03:54:00.160 --> 03:54:04.120]   - Yes, so this is one of the great combat strategies
[03:54:04.120 --> 03:54:07.400]   across the animal kingdom, across human history, et cetera.
[03:54:07.400 --> 03:54:12.480]   The second would be ambush tactics.
[03:54:12.480 --> 03:54:18.200]   If you can ambush an opponent with the element of surprise,
[03:54:18.200 --> 03:54:22.960]   this is huge for success in combat.
[03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:25.400]   Almost all of the truly successful predators
[03:54:25.400 --> 03:54:27.560]   on this planet are ambush predators.
[03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:30.920]   The ability to get off to a good start
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:34.280]   in a way where opponents simply can't recover
[03:54:34.280 --> 03:54:35.620]   is huge for combat.
[03:54:35.620 --> 03:54:39.360]   - Are we allowing ambush in our discussion?
[03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:43.920]   Because humans would call this cheating perhaps.
[03:54:43.920 --> 03:54:44.920]   - Yes, we would.
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:48.420]   And humans are pretty damn good at it too.
[03:54:48.420 --> 03:54:53.040]   And then the third is endurance.
[03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:58.040]   Okay, some species, some people,
[03:54:59.040 --> 03:55:01.640]   humans actually are pretty good at this,
[03:55:01.640 --> 03:55:03.360]   use endurance as a weapon.
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:06.280]   And they simply wear an opponent down over time
[03:55:06.280 --> 03:55:09.000]   and break them.
[03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:11.600]   Internationally, this can be done economically
[03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:15.360]   through numbers, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:55:15.360 --> 03:55:18.360]   And you can destroy someone with your sheer endurance.
[03:55:18.360 --> 03:55:20.120]   - Yeah, a lot of wars throughout human history
[03:55:20.120 --> 03:55:21.280]   has been siege warfare.
[03:55:21.280 --> 03:55:23.800]   - Yeah, and so when you ask yourself,
[03:55:23.800 --> 03:55:25.880]   okay, which one of these animals
[03:55:25.880 --> 03:55:29.120]   are going to be the most successful in combat?
[03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:32.280]   Ask yourself, well, there's these three elements
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:35.100]   which tend to determine successful failure in warfare.
[03:55:35.100 --> 03:55:39.440]   Which animals exhibit these three principles the best?
[03:55:39.440 --> 03:55:41.760]   And we'll discuss this.
[03:55:41.760 --> 03:55:46.760]   But as far as generalities go,
[03:55:46.760 --> 03:55:48.280]   whenever you ask a question,
[03:55:48.280 --> 03:55:50.280]   who will win between A and B,
[03:55:50.280 --> 03:55:52.800]   ask yourself in terms of the light
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:55:54.240]   of what we've just discussed.
[03:55:55.240 --> 03:55:58.200]   What is their skill set?
[03:55:58.200 --> 03:56:01.520]   What are their attributes, both mental and physical?
[03:56:01.520 --> 03:56:04.000]   What is their experience in utilizing these
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:05.360]   in real world situations?
[03:56:05.360 --> 03:56:08.400]   And then the four more tactical elements,
[03:56:08.400 --> 03:56:10.400]   who gets to initiate contact?
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:13.240]   Can you break off contact at any given time?
[03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:14.800]   What is your endurance?
[03:56:14.800 --> 03:56:18.880]   Can you keep going longer than your opponent does?
[03:56:18.880 --> 03:56:22.040]   - So a skill set, I wonder if a big component of that,
[03:56:22.040 --> 03:56:23.600]   of how much practice there is
[03:56:23.600 --> 03:56:25.080]   off the battlefield. - Yes, exactly.
[03:56:25.080 --> 03:56:26.960]   - So how much, quote unquote,
[03:56:26.960 --> 03:56:30.000]   you would probably call it play, like play fighting.
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:32.400]   - Let's start going through our animals, okay?
[03:56:32.400 --> 03:56:34.480]   When you look at the gorilla,
[03:56:34.480 --> 03:56:37.640]   you will see immediately that almost every experience
[03:56:37.640 --> 03:56:40.800]   a gorilla has of combat is theatrical.
[03:56:40.800 --> 03:56:42.560]   - Yes.
[03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:45.800]   - They don't engage in killing things.
[03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:50.280]   They scare rival males away
[03:56:50.280 --> 03:56:53.400]   in order to gain ownership of females.
[03:56:53.400 --> 03:56:57.600]   But there is almost no intraspecies death
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:56:58.440]   in those conflicts.
[03:56:58.440 --> 03:57:00.400]   They're almost entirely theatrical.
[03:57:00.400 --> 03:57:04.640]   They have, for example, enormous canine teeth,
[03:57:04.640 --> 03:57:07.520]   but there is no record of them ever being used in combat.
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:14.200]   They appear to be used purely for intimidation purposes.
[03:57:14.200 --> 03:57:20.880]   There's a sense in which they have
[03:57:20.880 --> 03:57:22.720]   this tremendous appearance,
[03:57:22.720 --> 03:57:25.360]   and they have tremendous potential.
[03:57:25.360 --> 03:57:27.920]   They really do have freakish levels of strength
[03:57:27.920 --> 03:57:31.720]   in many different ways.
[03:57:31.720 --> 03:57:36.240]   And yet, the actual track record of using it is negligible.
[03:57:36.240 --> 03:57:38.160]   - So strange that evolution would develop
[03:57:38.160 --> 03:57:40.720]   such a powerful killing machine.
[03:57:40.720 --> 03:57:43.160]   - Like their bite force just makes no sense
[03:57:43.160 --> 03:57:44.960]   with regard to what they actually eat.
[03:57:44.960 --> 03:57:47.200]   - I think, well, no, I think--
[03:57:47.200 --> 03:57:49.600]   - Even the presence of canines doesn't make a lot of sense.
[03:57:49.600 --> 03:57:51.480]   They're not gonna use them, what are they?
[03:57:51.480 --> 03:57:52.600]   - It comes down to this idea
[03:57:52.600 --> 03:57:54.920]   of their big thing is intimidation.
[03:57:54.920 --> 03:57:58.600]   - So as a show, you wanna fake it
[03:57:58.600 --> 03:58:00.040]   and don't care if you ever make it,
[03:58:00.040 --> 03:58:01.400]   'cause fake it was good enough
[03:58:01.400 --> 03:58:03.320]   given that particular dynamic.
[03:58:03.320 --> 03:58:06.780]   - Now let's contrast that with a male lion.
[03:58:06.780 --> 03:58:13.520]   Lions take on the biggest, meanest, toughest animals
[03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:21.240]   in the most competitive killing war on planet Earth,
[03:58:21.240 --> 03:58:23.360]   which is continental Africa.
[03:58:23.360 --> 03:58:27.960]   And they literally just take,
[03:58:27.960 --> 03:58:30.080]   I mean, occasionally they lose,
[03:58:30.080 --> 03:58:34.960]   but it's rare and they take out everything.
[03:58:34.960 --> 03:58:36.680]   Just in order to eat,
[03:58:36.680 --> 03:58:40.200]   they have to take down wildebeest, Cape buffalo.
[03:58:40.200 --> 03:58:43.880]   Like Cape buffalo are incredibly dangerous beasts
[03:58:43.880 --> 03:58:45.400]   just by themselves.
[03:58:45.400 --> 03:58:48.060]   And yet, lions regularly take them down.
[03:58:49.280 --> 03:58:51.160]   Occasionally, large numbers of lions
[03:58:51.160 --> 03:58:52.680]   will even swarm elephant
[03:58:52.680 --> 03:58:56.160]   and over 12-hour periods take down elephant
[03:58:56.160 --> 03:58:57.280]   on some occasions.
[03:58:57.280 --> 03:59:00.040]   This is all on video, this is not just speculation.
[03:59:00.040 --> 03:59:04.120]   So they just have a level of combat experience
[03:59:04.120 --> 03:59:07.280]   which no other animal can do.
[03:59:07.280 --> 03:59:09.240]   - If I were to also project,
[03:59:09.240 --> 03:59:12.160]   so the Eastern European style of wrestling
[03:59:12.160 --> 03:59:13.920]   where they spend so many hours on the mat,
[03:59:13.920 --> 03:59:16.520]   they really value the number of hours on the mat
[03:59:16.520 --> 03:59:18.760]   at play from childhood.
[03:59:18.760 --> 03:59:20.920]   The lions probably,
[03:59:20.920 --> 03:59:23.960]   from my extensive watching videos on YouTube,
[03:59:23.960 --> 03:59:27.120]   they seem to play with each other for fun a lot.
[03:59:27.120 --> 03:59:27.960]   And I guess with the gorilla--
[03:59:27.960 --> 03:59:29.080]   - Even as cubs you see it.
[03:59:29.080 --> 03:59:31.920]   - You don't interact, you don't play with other gorillas.
[03:59:31.920 --> 03:59:35.520]   Like you're more spending a lot more time
[03:59:35.520 --> 03:59:38.560]   around the opposite sex.
[03:59:38.560 --> 03:59:39.400]   - Yeah.
[03:59:39.400 --> 03:59:45.480]   I mean, even lions, when they fight each other,
[03:59:45.480 --> 03:59:48.600]   the mortality rate when lions fight each other
[03:59:48.600 --> 03:59:51.400]   male lions for ownership of a pride
[03:59:51.400 --> 03:59:54.000]   is very, very high,
[03:59:54.000 --> 03:59:57.040]   much, much higher than I believe any other species on earth.
[03:59:57.040 --> 04:00:00.640]   They almost always fights to the death
[04:00:00.640 --> 04:00:02.280]   for the simple reason that
[04:00:02.280 --> 04:00:04.520]   when a male lion loses control of a pride,
[04:00:04.520 --> 04:00:07.360]   the first act the new lion does
[04:00:07.360 --> 04:00:11.120]   is to kill the genetic offspring of the previous male lion.
[04:00:11.120 --> 04:00:13.240]   So when a lion fights another male lion,
[04:00:13.240 --> 04:00:15.000]   when one male lion fights another,
[04:00:15.000 --> 04:00:16.800]   it's not just a fight for his own life,
[04:00:16.800 --> 04:00:21.360]   it's a fight for his genetic offspring.
[04:00:21.360 --> 04:00:24.720]   And failure means not only does he die,
[04:00:24.720 --> 04:00:26.440]   all his offspring dies.
[04:00:26.440 --> 04:00:30.120]   And so when they fight, the implications are so deep.
[04:00:30.120 --> 04:00:34.660]   It's like a fight for your, not just you, but your DNA.
[04:00:34.660 --> 04:00:40.600]   Most male lions have very short runs at the top.
[04:00:40.600 --> 04:00:45.000]   They get killed or run off by other lions.
[04:00:45.400 --> 04:00:50.400]   Now, this kind of harsh combat experience,
[04:00:50.400 --> 04:00:54.360]   no other animal can claim to have this.
[04:00:54.360 --> 04:00:56.940]   Between what they kill to eat
[04:00:56.940 --> 04:01:01.940]   and what they have to do to defend their stake in a pride,
[04:01:01.940 --> 04:01:04.620]   no other animal fights like that.
[04:01:04.620 --> 04:01:10.600]   They just bring a level of depth to combat
[04:01:10.600 --> 04:01:13.000]   which is unmatched in the animal kingdom.
[04:01:13.920 --> 04:01:16.600]   They also have some other elements too
[04:01:16.600 --> 04:01:20.760]   that they get the luxury because of their social nature
[04:01:20.760 --> 04:01:23.120]   of taking more risks than other animals.
[04:01:23.120 --> 04:01:25.380]   Like a tiger hunts alone.
[04:01:25.380 --> 04:01:27.800]   So if it gets injured, it's a big problem.
[04:01:27.800 --> 04:01:29.680]   It can die if it's injured.
[04:01:29.680 --> 04:01:33.680]   A lion can fight a Cape buffalo, get injured,
[04:01:33.680 --> 04:01:35.680]   and be covered by the other lions for food
[04:01:35.680 --> 04:01:37.640]   until it recovers.
[04:01:37.640 --> 04:01:39.520]   So it learns to take risks
[04:01:39.520 --> 04:01:43.300]   and it's not afraid to go out and fight very, very hard.
[04:01:43.300 --> 04:01:45.680]   Whereas other animals tend to shy away from risk
[04:01:45.680 --> 04:01:46.960]   because they're solitary.
[04:01:46.960 --> 04:01:50.720]   Bears are solitary, tigers are solitary.
[04:01:50.720 --> 04:01:53.640]   So they learn from an early age not to take the big risks,
[04:01:53.640 --> 04:01:55.560]   to go to a certain level and stop.
[04:01:55.560 --> 04:01:56.520]   - If I could push back.
[04:01:56.520 --> 04:01:59.840]   So that's aggression and risk-taking.
[04:01:59.840 --> 04:02:01.440]   That's a plus for the lion.
[04:02:01.440 --> 04:02:05.360]   But to defend the gorilla, 'cause you said skillset,
[04:02:05.360 --> 04:02:09.040]   they are of all of those, the only ones that use tools,
[04:02:09.040 --> 04:02:11.400]   have shown to use tools,
[04:02:11.400 --> 04:02:14.580]   we didn't say anything about weapons.
[04:02:14.580 --> 04:02:17.500]   A gorilla could, in theory, pick up a rock.
[04:02:17.500 --> 04:02:23.580]   And it does have the force, the power,
[04:02:23.580 --> 04:02:26.620]   and the capabilities to do a lot of damage.
[04:02:26.620 --> 04:02:28.380]   It doesn't have the practice.
[04:02:28.380 --> 04:02:30.120]   It doesn't have the experience.
[04:02:30.120 --> 04:02:35.120]   But don't you think if a gorilla's back is to the wall,
[04:02:35.120 --> 04:02:40.600]   so you put them in a situation of it is life and death.
[04:02:41.440 --> 04:02:43.040]   For both the lion and the gorilla.
[04:02:43.040 --> 04:02:47.220]   Don't you value intelligence at least a little bit here?
[04:02:47.220 --> 04:02:49.960]   There's a reason why humans, this is like evidence
[04:02:49.960 --> 04:02:54.740]   that humans have spread all across the world
[04:02:54.740 --> 04:02:57.000]   while being kind of weak.
[04:02:57.000 --> 04:02:57.840]   Why?
[04:02:57.840 --> 04:03:00.720]   - Intelligence is a huge, huge asset.
[04:03:00.720 --> 04:03:02.480]   Humanity is positive proof
[04:03:02.480 --> 04:03:04.780]   that it is the most important asset.
[04:03:04.780 --> 04:03:09.780]   But it takes time in order to work its magic.
[04:03:10.140 --> 04:03:13.540]   It took humans 200,000 years
[04:03:13.540 --> 04:03:14.860]   to go from the bottom of the food chain
[04:03:14.860 --> 04:03:16.300]   to the top of the food chain.
[04:03:16.300 --> 04:03:19.080]   And gorillas have a lot of work to do
[04:03:19.080 --> 04:03:20.580]   before they get to that level.
[04:03:20.580 --> 04:03:22.740]   - I guess humans can pass knowledge.
[04:03:22.740 --> 04:03:25.140]   - You said in theory, gorillas could do this.
[04:03:25.140 --> 04:03:27.280]   But let's talk about practice now.
[04:03:27.280 --> 04:03:30.380]   First off, there are many documented incidents
[04:03:30.380 --> 04:03:32.540]   of leopards killing gorillas.
[04:03:32.540 --> 04:03:35.580]   - That's anecdotal evidence.
[04:03:35.580 --> 04:03:36.420]   - No, it's not anecdotal.
[04:03:36.420 --> 04:03:38.300]   - There's a bunch of bitch ass gorillas walking around.
[04:03:38.300 --> 04:03:39.240]   We know this.
[04:03:39.240 --> 04:03:40.080]   We're asking.
[04:03:40.080 --> 04:03:41.220]   - It's not anecdotal.
[04:03:41.220 --> 04:03:43.460]   It was observed by a group of people
[04:03:43.460 --> 04:03:45.780]   who specialized in observing gorillas
[04:03:45.780 --> 04:03:47.420]   over a 12 year period.
[04:03:47.420 --> 04:03:52.420]   They regularly found gorilla toes in leopard defecation.
[04:03:52.420 --> 04:03:57.820]   They also saw that over a certain period,
[04:03:57.820 --> 04:04:00.140]   some 36 gorillas have been killed.
[04:04:00.140 --> 04:04:02.860]   And evidence strongly suggested
[04:04:02.860 --> 04:04:05.020]   leopard predation was the reason.
[04:04:05.020 --> 04:04:07.520]   Apparently, leopards had figured out
[04:04:07.520 --> 04:04:11.440]   that there was a femoral artery in gorillas' legs.
[04:04:11.440 --> 04:04:13.540]   And were doing a move which, from the sounds of it,
[04:04:13.540 --> 04:04:15.140]   sounds a lot like a Barambolo.
[04:04:15.140 --> 04:04:16.700]   Where they were spinning underneath gorillas
[04:04:16.700 --> 04:04:19.260]   and biting the femoral artery and then disengaging
[04:04:19.260 --> 04:04:21.780]   and watching them bleed out and die and then eating them.
[04:04:21.780 --> 04:04:26.780]   Now, a leopard is no match for a lion.
[04:04:26.780 --> 04:04:30.580]   The only defense it has to a lion is to run up a tree.
[04:04:30.580 --> 04:04:32.260]   It cannot engage with a lion
[04:04:32.260 --> 04:04:34.900]   on anything close to equal terms.
[04:04:34.900 --> 04:04:37.280]   - It may seem like we're going on tangents, but we're not.
[04:04:37.280 --> 04:04:38.420]   Just because of the foot,
[04:04:38.420 --> 04:04:40.700]   the attack of the artery on the foot.
[04:04:40.700 --> 04:04:44.020]   Is there weaknesses that the lion might have of that?
[04:04:44.020 --> 04:04:46.740]   - What I'm saying is, I know it's not equivalent,
[04:04:46.740 --> 04:04:49.480]   but the fact that a leopard does so well
[04:04:49.480 --> 04:04:51.860]   against even fully grown male gorillas
[04:04:51.860 --> 04:04:55.380]   should make you rather suspicious
[04:04:55.380 --> 04:04:57.960]   of a gorilla's ability to fight a lion.
[04:04:57.960 --> 04:04:58.800]   - Fair enough.
[04:04:58.800 --> 04:04:59.620]   - Let's also go further into this.
[04:04:59.620 --> 04:05:02.300]   Let's talk about concentration of force.
[04:05:02.300 --> 04:05:05.740]   A lion has the quintessential concentration of force,
[04:05:05.740 --> 04:05:07.840]   which is fangs and claws.
[04:05:07.840 --> 04:05:12.560]   The gorilla is the exact opposite.
[04:05:12.560 --> 04:05:14.980]   It can't even make a fist.
[04:05:14.980 --> 04:05:18.620]   And so it can only throw open-handed slaps and grab things.
[04:05:18.620 --> 04:05:22.760]   So it has no ability with its arms to concentrate force
[04:05:22.760 --> 04:05:24.780]   in any kind of efficient way.
[04:05:24.780 --> 04:05:28.740]   When a lion or a tiger, or a bear for that matter,
[04:05:28.740 --> 04:05:31.480]   swings at you, it's got four claws
[04:05:31.480 --> 04:05:33.560]   from four to six inches long.
[04:05:33.560 --> 04:05:35.880]   That's like four blades going into you.
[04:05:35.880 --> 04:05:38.240]   They can retract their claws so they're always sharp.
[04:05:38.240 --> 04:05:42.000]   - But the reach is significantly longer for the gorilla.
[04:05:42.000 --> 04:05:42.840]   The length of the--
[04:05:42.840 --> 04:05:44.760]   - The ability to engage with speed
[04:05:44.760 --> 04:05:47.960]   on the part of the cats is far, far greater.
[04:05:47.960 --> 04:05:50.160]   - And also mobility on two feet,
[04:05:50.160 --> 04:05:53.760]   the bipedal nature of a gorilla, the temporary bipedal.
[04:05:53.760 --> 04:05:55.200]   So the bear has the same.
[04:05:55.200 --> 04:05:57.040]   - It has no impact.
[04:05:57.040 --> 04:06:00.440]   Humans are bipedal, and lions kill 240 humans a year
[04:06:00.440 --> 04:06:01.280]   on average.
[04:06:03.040 --> 04:06:05.960]   - So okay, okay, okay, what about bear?
[04:06:05.960 --> 04:06:07.680]   - Now bear, bear is a different--
[04:06:07.680 --> 04:06:10.720]   - Has all the same things that a lion has.
[04:06:10.720 --> 04:06:14.160]   The claws, the teeth, has more weight,
[04:06:14.160 --> 04:06:18.960]   has more strength, has more power.
[04:06:18.960 --> 04:06:21.040]   - Okay, now this is an interesting question.
[04:06:21.040 --> 04:06:24.200]   Okay, you get a fully grown North American grizzly
[04:06:24.200 --> 04:06:25.400]   versus an African lion.
[04:06:25.400 --> 04:06:26.560]   This is an interesting battle.
[04:06:26.560 --> 04:06:28.240]   - I also have questions about polar bears.
[04:06:28.240 --> 04:06:31.520]   It's unclear to me, 'cause they're bigger in every way
[04:06:31.520 --> 04:06:35.040]   than a grizzly, but they probably don't get the experience
[04:06:35.040 --> 04:06:35.880]   in the practice.
[04:06:35.880 --> 04:06:40.520]   - Yeah, also they have a much more limited set of animals
[04:06:40.520 --> 04:06:42.400]   that they prey upon.
[04:06:42.400 --> 04:06:45.680]   So I'm pretty sure grizzly is gonna be tough to beat
[04:06:45.680 --> 04:06:47.240]   as far as top bear goes.
[04:06:47.240 --> 04:06:55.320]   A grizzly bear, I believe, would be a formidable adversary,
[04:06:55.320 --> 04:06:57.520]   even for a male lion.
[04:06:57.520 --> 04:07:00.320]   They're literally twice their size.
[04:07:00.320 --> 04:07:04.200]   They have an ability to get away from strangleholds
[04:07:04.200 --> 04:07:05.640]   by standing up on two legs.
[04:07:05.640 --> 04:07:07.720]   So the lion's primary method of killing,
[04:07:07.720 --> 04:07:10.080]   which is to strangle, would be very difficult
[04:07:10.080 --> 04:07:12.040]   for them to employ upon a bear.
[04:07:12.040 --> 04:07:16.640]   Interestingly, the bear's primary method of killing
[04:07:16.640 --> 04:07:17.680]   is to pin.
[04:07:17.680 --> 04:07:20.160]   It pins animals and then just slowly eats them
[04:07:20.160 --> 04:07:21.280]   while they're still alive.
[04:07:21.280 --> 04:07:24.360]   They have a rather barbaric means of killing.
[04:07:24.360 --> 04:07:26.760]   Lions are much more humane in the way they kill.
[04:07:29.800 --> 04:07:32.560]   What I see as the primary problem is that neither one
[04:07:32.560 --> 04:07:34.960]   would be able to kill the other.
[04:07:34.960 --> 04:07:36.120]   - That finishing thing that you mentioned.
[04:07:36.120 --> 04:07:40.080]   - Yeah, they both fail on the finishing criteria.
[04:07:40.080 --> 04:07:42.160]   The lion would not be able to strangle a bear.
[04:07:42.160 --> 04:07:45.100]   Even in the best case scenario where he got his teeth
[04:07:45.100 --> 04:07:47.080]   into the neck, the bear can stand up
[04:07:47.080 --> 04:07:48.620]   and presumably shake him off.
[04:07:48.620 --> 04:07:56.960]   The bear would never be able to pin a lion
[04:07:56.960 --> 04:07:58.520]   for long enough to be able to hold it down
[04:07:58.520 --> 04:08:01.240]   and slowly maul it over time the way it can
[04:08:01.240 --> 04:08:03.200]   with an elk or a caribou.
[04:08:03.200 --> 04:08:05.880]   So I don't believe either would be able
[04:08:05.880 --> 04:08:07.160]   to finish the other.
[04:08:07.160 --> 04:08:08.400]   - They would just become exhausted.
[04:08:08.400 --> 04:08:10.620]   - It would come down to endurance.
[04:08:10.620 --> 04:08:11.960]   Now that's where things get interesting
[04:08:11.960 --> 04:08:15.280]   because the bear is much more of an endurance hunter
[04:08:15.280 --> 04:08:18.020]   and the lion is much more of an ambush hunter.
[04:08:18.020 --> 04:08:21.520]   Lion's quick, explosive, much higher top speed.
[04:08:21.520 --> 04:08:24.280]   They've got a top speed of 45 to 50 miles an hour.
[04:08:24.280 --> 04:08:27.920]   A bear can do up to 35, but it can run for long periods
[04:08:27.920 --> 04:08:30.920]   up to 25 miles an hour, very long periods.
[04:08:30.920 --> 04:08:34.600]   They're mostly an endurance hunter.
[04:08:34.600 --> 04:08:38.560]   They just run elk and moose down until they're exhausted
[04:08:38.560 --> 04:08:40.860]   and then pin them and kill them.
[04:08:40.860 --> 04:08:43.160]   So if it came down to endurance,
[04:08:43.160 --> 04:08:44.840]   it might go the way of the bear
[04:08:44.840 --> 04:08:47.720]   if they were caged up together.
[04:08:47.720 --> 04:08:53.000]   However, there is very strong evidence
[04:08:53.000 --> 04:08:57.000]   from both hunters and video
[04:08:57.000 --> 04:08:59.320]   which shows on many occasions,
[04:08:59.320 --> 04:09:04.320]   bears being chased off by cougar and wolverines.
[04:09:04.320 --> 04:09:07.560]   Now-
[04:09:07.560 --> 04:09:08.400]   - What's that?
[04:09:08.400 --> 04:09:09.220]   That's fear?
[04:09:09.220 --> 04:09:10.060]   What is that?
[04:09:10.060 --> 04:09:10.960]   What do you mean chased off?
[04:09:10.960 --> 04:09:14.000]   - If they fight over meat,
[04:09:14.000 --> 04:09:17.740]   and say that, for example, a cougar has killed something
[04:09:17.740 --> 04:09:19.500]   and the bear wants the meat,
[04:09:19.500 --> 04:09:20.340]   the cougar will-
[04:09:20.340 --> 04:09:22.360]   - The bear has risk aversion.
[04:09:22.360 --> 04:09:23.560]   - Exactly, exactly.
[04:09:23.560 --> 04:09:25.180]   The bear's a risk averse.
[04:09:25.180 --> 04:09:26.080]   What I would say is this.
[04:09:26.080 --> 04:09:29.520]   The bears are very, very powerful in their domain,
[04:09:29.520 --> 04:09:32.840]   but they don't have the battle experience of a lion.
[04:09:32.840 --> 04:09:35.640]   They don't take on animals as tough as a Cape buffalo.
[04:09:35.640 --> 04:09:37.480]   They don't take on elephant.
[04:09:37.480 --> 04:09:39.200]   The toughest thing it would probably take on
[04:09:39.200 --> 04:09:41.400]   would probably be a bull moose.
[04:09:41.400 --> 04:09:46.080]   And a bull moose is a formidable animal,
[04:09:46.080 --> 04:09:48.440]   but it's nothing like a Cape buffalo.
[04:09:48.440 --> 04:09:52.240]   It's nothing like an elephant or a hippopotamus.
[04:09:52.240 --> 04:09:55.680]   So what I would suggest is this.
[04:09:55.680 --> 04:09:58.000]   In the wild, I don't believe either one
[04:09:58.000 --> 04:09:59.520]   is capable of killing the other,
[04:09:59.520 --> 04:10:01.660]   but I do believe based on video evidence
[04:10:01.660 --> 04:10:04.840]   of cougars and wolverines chasing off bears,
[04:10:04.840 --> 04:10:09.760]   that a lion would provide enough threat
[04:10:09.760 --> 04:10:13.160]   in a brief fight that a bear would back away.
[04:10:13.160 --> 04:10:15.160]   If you put them in a cage, however,
[04:10:15.160 --> 04:10:17.160]   where neither one could back away,
[04:10:17.160 --> 04:10:19.360]   I would slightly favor the bear
[04:10:19.360 --> 04:10:22.280]   based on the fact that neither one can kill each other,
[04:10:22.280 --> 04:10:23.600]   it would come down to endurance.
[04:10:23.600 --> 04:10:24.840]   - You mean like an octagon?
[04:10:24.840 --> 04:10:27.320]   - Yeah, that's gotta be the next UFC, by the way.
[04:10:27.320 --> 04:10:29.160]   Bear versus lion.
[04:10:29.160 --> 04:10:30.000]   - But things change.
[04:10:30.000 --> 04:10:32.920]   Joe Rogan is a big fan of the idea of fighting in a stadium,
[04:10:32.920 --> 04:10:34.560]   for humans fighting in a stadium.
[04:10:34.560 --> 04:10:38.120]   So in a stadium, a bear--
[04:10:38.120 --> 04:10:39.840]   - I would slightly favor a bear.
[04:10:39.840 --> 04:10:43.200]   Now, I still think that the lion would have a chance,
[04:10:43.200 --> 04:10:45.500]   but I would favor the bear in a betting match.
[04:10:45.500 --> 04:10:48.280]   Some of the best evidence we have
[04:10:48.280 --> 04:10:49.760]   for animal versus animal fights
[04:10:49.760 --> 04:10:50.880]   come from the ancient Romans,
[04:10:50.880 --> 04:10:54.640]   who actually used to put animals in gladiatorial combat.
[04:10:54.640 --> 04:11:00.280]   They, for example, had several incidents
[04:11:00.280 --> 04:11:04.880]   where they wrote about tiger versus lion conflict.
[04:11:04.880 --> 04:11:07.640]   And in one famous passage,
[04:11:07.640 --> 04:11:12.640]   they described a lion getting destroyed by a female tiger.
[04:11:12.640 --> 04:11:16.760]   So there's some evidence to suggest
[04:11:16.760 --> 04:11:20.320]   that they had more expertise of this than we do,
[04:11:20.320 --> 04:11:23.880]   because they had a big population of wild animals,
[04:11:23.880 --> 04:11:26.060]   which they just put to fight each other.
[04:11:26.060 --> 04:11:30.200]   Unfortunately, there's nothing that they wrote
[04:11:30.200 --> 04:11:32.960]   about bears versus lion.
[04:11:32.960 --> 04:11:36.000]   They did talk about bears versus bulls.
[04:11:36.000 --> 04:11:40.320]   They did talk about lions versus tigers,
[04:11:40.320 --> 04:11:43.440]   but they never mentioned bear versus lion,
[04:11:43.440 --> 04:11:45.320]   so we don't have any evidence for that.
[04:11:45.320 --> 04:11:47.280]   So we have to be a little bit more speculative.
[04:11:47.280 --> 04:11:49.880]   Now, given that bears do get chased off by cougar,
[04:11:49.880 --> 04:11:53.600]   and cougar is weak compared with a male lion--
[04:11:53.600 --> 04:11:55.440]   - Well, what do you draw from that, by the way?
[04:11:55.440 --> 04:11:56.560]   - I would suggest that--
[04:11:56.560 --> 04:11:58.320]   - Is it about the bears or about the cougar?
[04:11:58.320 --> 04:11:59.520]   - It's more about the bear.
[04:11:59.520 --> 04:12:02.120]   Like, in theory, a bear should be able to crush a cougar,
[04:12:02.120 --> 04:12:04.360]   but it seems to be the bear is just saying,
[04:12:04.360 --> 04:12:06.280]   "Eh, this thing could hurt me,
[04:12:06.280 --> 04:12:09.320]   "so I'm not gonna risk injury," and backs away.
[04:12:09.320 --> 04:12:12.600]   I think it would back away in the wild from a lion,
[04:12:12.600 --> 04:12:14.500]   but put him in a cage,
[04:12:14.500 --> 04:12:18.160]   and I slightly favor the grizzly, based on endurance.
[04:12:19.000 --> 04:12:21.840]   - So the final conclusion,
[04:12:21.840 --> 04:12:24.960]   if you had to just bet everything you own,
[04:12:24.960 --> 04:12:29.320]   so you got, let's say, we got the octagon,
[04:12:29.320 --> 04:12:30.580]   we bring in a bear.
[04:12:30.580 --> 04:12:34.600]   Now, this is, like, legendary bear, okay?
[04:12:34.600 --> 04:12:35.800]   - Full-grown grizzly.
[04:12:35.800 --> 04:12:38.560]   - Full-grown grizzly, but not only that,
[04:12:38.560 --> 04:12:40.320]   that grizzly has seen some shit.
[04:12:40.320 --> 04:12:42.080]   - What's the most it could have seen?
[04:12:42.080 --> 04:12:43.920]   A bull moose?
[04:12:43.920 --> 04:12:44.920]   A caribou?
[04:12:44.920 --> 04:12:46.560]   That's the toughest opponent it's ever had?
[04:12:46.560 --> 04:12:48.280]   - It once, no, no, no, no,
[04:12:48.280 --> 04:12:52.600]   no, this one once ran into a pack of other grizzlies
[04:12:52.600 --> 04:12:56.200]   and had to fend, and he's got scars.
[04:12:56.200 --> 04:12:57.760]   - Pack of grizzlies, isn't there a pack of grizzlies
[04:12:57.760 --> 04:12:58.920]   that's solitary?
[04:12:58.920 --> 04:13:00.520]   - Wolves, wolves, wolves.
[04:13:00.520 --> 04:13:02.120]   Wolves are not practiced for a bear.
[04:13:02.120 --> 04:13:03.440]   Who attacks a bear?
[04:13:03.440 --> 04:13:04.560]   - That's my point.
[04:13:04.560 --> 04:13:06.480]   Bears don't really live in a competitive environment.
[04:13:06.480 --> 04:13:07.320]   Lions do.
[04:13:07.320 --> 04:13:09.160]   - But sometimes it can get desperate,
[04:13:09.160 --> 04:13:11.160]   as it was a pack of wolves.
[04:13:11.160 --> 04:13:13.560]   - But a pack of wolves is nothing.
[04:13:13.560 --> 04:13:15.400]   It's nothing.
[04:13:15.400 --> 04:13:16.220]   - All right, fine.
[04:13:16.220 --> 04:13:17.680]   - Lions deal with packs of hyenas.
[04:13:17.680 --> 04:13:20.280]   - Okay, what was the, just imagine,
[04:13:20.280 --> 04:13:21.520]   over the past hundred years,
[04:13:21.520 --> 04:13:24.000]   what do you think is the hardest fight
[04:13:24.000 --> 04:13:26.560]   that a grizzly bear has been in?
[04:13:26.560 --> 04:13:28.720]   Like somewhere in Alaska, we never heard,
[04:13:28.720 --> 04:13:30.560]   all of a sudden, in the middle of the night,
[04:13:30.560 --> 04:13:32.360]   all you hear is the bear just--
[04:13:32.360 --> 04:13:33.280]   - Yeah, they don't really,
[04:13:33.280 --> 04:13:34.120]   there's nothing that tough.
[04:13:34.120 --> 04:13:36.200]   - No, there's gotta have been something.
[04:13:36.200 --> 04:13:38.280]   Humans have killed tens of millions of people in wars.
[04:13:38.280 --> 04:13:40.680]   - They run away from cougars and wolverines.
[04:13:40.680 --> 04:13:42.360]   - No, that's anecdotal evidence.
[04:13:42.360 --> 04:13:44.040]   There's gotta be one bear.
[04:13:44.040 --> 04:13:45.240]   - There's video footage of it.
[04:13:45.240 --> 04:13:46.280]   You can watch it yourself.
[04:13:46.280 --> 04:13:47.720]   - That's called anecdotal evidence.
[04:13:47.720 --> 04:13:51.500]   There's got, I guarantee you, in the dark of the night,
[04:13:51.500 --> 04:13:55.080]   there was an epic battle of which there's still legend
[04:13:55.080 --> 04:13:56.960]   amongst the bears in that part of Canada.
[04:13:56.960 --> 04:13:59.480]   - Who did it battle in Canada?
[04:13:59.480 --> 04:14:00.480]   - Moose.
[04:14:00.480 --> 04:14:02.560]   - Other bears, you don't think they'd go at it?
[04:14:02.560 --> 04:14:03.640]   - Yeah, bears fight each other,
[04:14:03.640 --> 04:14:05.360]   but it's largely theatrical.
[04:14:05.360 --> 04:14:06.200]   They never kill each other.
[04:14:06.200 --> 04:14:07.040]   When lions fight each other,
[04:14:07.040 --> 04:14:08.700]   they kill each other all the time.
[04:14:08.700 --> 04:14:12.600]   Someone would have seen it by now.
[04:14:12.600 --> 04:14:13.800]   - Interesting.
[04:14:13.800 --> 04:14:16.080]   All right, so you're already saying--
[04:14:16.080 --> 04:14:17.400]   - My point is that bears are just,
[04:14:17.400 --> 04:14:19.640]   they wanna get their feet wet.
[04:14:19.640 --> 04:14:21.600]   - You're giving no credit for gorillas,
[04:14:21.600 --> 04:14:23.040]   so you're saying lion wins.
[04:14:23.040 --> 04:14:23.880]   Your money's on the lion.
[04:14:23.880 --> 04:14:26.480]   - No, I'm saying lion would win in the wild
[04:14:26.480 --> 04:14:27.840]   because they can't kill each other.
[04:14:27.840 --> 04:14:28.920]   They can't end the fight.
[04:14:28.920 --> 04:14:31.520]   That's one of our most important criteria.
[04:14:31.520 --> 04:14:35.160]   But lions can almost always initiate the action
[04:14:35.160 --> 04:14:38.600]   because they have much better ability
[04:14:38.600 --> 04:14:40.160]   to see at night, for example.
[04:14:40.160 --> 04:14:42.400]   Bears have very average night vision.
[04:14:42.400 --> 04:14:44.440]   Lions have superb night vision.
[04:14:44.440 --> 04:14:47.400]   So at nighttime, they can always initiate the fight.
[04:14:47.400 --> 04:14:49.160]   Lions are natural ambush predators,
[04:14:49.160 --> 04:14:52.360]   so it's always gonna have the advantage of ambush.
[04:14:52.360 --> 04:14:56.240]   The great advantage that bears have is endurance.
[04:14:56.240 --> 04:14:57.840]   But bears are very risk-averse,
[04:14:57.840 --> 04:15:00.000]   and they're not used to fighting
[04:15:00.000 --> 04:15:01.680]   like the toughest, toughest animals.
[04:15:01.680 --> 04:15:04.920]   The toughest animal they fight is a moose or a caribou.
[04:15:04.920 --> 04:15:07.760]   These are not even close to the animals
[04:15:07.760 --> 04:15:10.320]   that lions have to go up against on a regular basis.
[04:15:10.320 --> 04:15:13.440]   - So if somebody wins, it's gonna be the lion for you.
[04:15:13.440 --> 04:15:17.240]   - I still think that the size and endurance of the bear,
[04:15:17.240 --> 04:15:18.920]   if they were locked in a cage together,
[04:15:18.920 --> 04:15:21.200]   I would still favor the bear under those circumstances.
[04:15:21.200 --> 04:15:23.440]   But in the wild, I believe the bear will back away
[04:15:23.440 --> 04:15:24.720]   quickly from the lion. - But in the cage,
[04:15:24.720 --> 04:15:26.320]   no time limit, you favor the bear.
[04:15:26.320 --> 04:15:28.080]   What if it's five rounds or five minutes,
[04:15:28.080 --> 04:15:29.040]   championship rounds?
[04:15:29.040 --> 04:15:30.080]   - Then I would go with the lion
[04:15:30.080 --> 04:15:32.200]   because the lion has a huge speed advantage.
[04:15:32.200 --> 04:15:33.040]   - So it's gonna--
[04:15:33.040 --> 04:15:37.480]   - It's gonna injure it, tear it up, and do immediate damage.
[04:15:37.480 --> 04:15:38.480]   Like, I'll put it this way.
[04:15:38.480 --> 04:15:40.680]   If lion and bear fight, first 15 minutes,
[04:15:40.680 --> 04:15:42.520]   I favor the lion 100%.
[04:15:42.520 --> 04:15:46.640]   But then as time goes by, that size and weight is gonna,
[04:15:46.640 --> 04:15:48.880]   and endurance is gonna have an effect.
[04:15:48.880 --> 04:15:50.400]   - I'll bring up shortly somebody
[04:15:50.400 --> 04:15:53.440]   that's gonna probably disagree with you about some things.
[04:15:53.440 --> 04:15:54.520]   - Hopefully it's a grizzly bear
[04:15:54.520 --> 04:15:55.680]   and he comes in and just eats me.
[04:15:55.680 --> 04:15:57.240]   (laughing)
[04:15:57.240 --> 04:15:58.920]   - Oh, that would be so epic.
[04:15:58.920 --> 04:16:01.000]   - Make a hell of a podcast.
[04:16:01.000 --> 04:16:03.200]   - I wonder who he would eat first,
[04:16:03.200 --> 04:16:06.280]   who would look scarier and more delicious, I'm not sure.
[04:16:06.280 --> 04:16:08.440]   The black and white could either piss him off.
[04:16:08.440 --> 04:16:09.640]   - He would think you were a penguin.
[04:16:09.640 --> 04:16:11.880]   (laughing)
[04:16:11.880 --> 04:16:14.080]   - Is that a good thing or not?
[04:16:14.080 --> 04:16:14.920]   - Not good.
[04:16:14.920 --> 04:16:17.480]   - If it was a polar bear, maybe it's different.
[04:16:17.480 --> 04:16:18.320]   Do you care--
[04:16:18.320 --> 04:16:19.680]   - If there's no penguins in the North Pole.
[04:16:19.680 --> 04:16:22.920]   - Deeply about your, about athletes you coached,
[04:16:22.920 --> 04:16:24.880]   about people in your life.
[04:16:24.880 --> 04:16:27.200]   So I have to ask this question.
[04:16:27.200 --> 04:16:31.080]   If one of those athletes, let's say Gordon Ryan,
[04:16:31.080 --> 04:16:34.300]   now I was the dictator of the world
[04:16:34.300 --> 04:16:35.760]   and this would entertain me,
[04:16:35.760 --> 04:16:39.520]   so I force you and Gordon to do this,
[04:16:39.520 --> 04:16:43.660]   to fight a bear or a lion, Gordon has to,
[04:16:43.660 --> 04:16:47.080]   how would you coach him to do it,
[04:16:47.080 --> 04:16:50.160]   to have any chance of winning?
[04:16:50.160 --> 04:16:51.360]   - He goes in empty-handed.
[04:16:51.360 --> 04:16:55.640]   - Empty-handed, you can choose stadium or cage.
[04:16:55.640 --> 04:17:00.400]   - Gordon Ryan, empty-handed versus a lion.
[04:17:00.400 --> 04:17:03.280]   - You get to choose, lion versus bear, it's up to you.
[04:17:03.280 --> 04:17:06.280]   - Okay, my advice would be very simple.
[04:17:06.280 --> 04:17:08.660]   I would say, Gordon, you're fucked.
[04:17:08.660 --> 04:17:12.100]   You're going to die badly.
[04:17:12.100 --> 04:17:14.840]   Choose the lion 'cause it will strangle you to death
[04:17:14.840 --> 04:17:17.760]   rather than pin you down and maul you to death.
[04:17:17.760 --> 04:17:20.020]   - Didn't we just talk about audacious goals?
[04:17:20.020 --> 04:17:22.400]   With Nicholas Mergoff.
[04:17:22.400 --> 04:17:24.360]   - This is not a question of audacious goals,
[04:17:24.360 --> 04:17:26.200]   this is a question of minimizing pain.
[04:17:26.200 --> 04:17:28.620]   - So you coach your athletes to quit
[04:17:28.620 --> 04:17:30.000]   before the battle has been fought.
[04:17:30.000 --> 04:17:31.380]   - 100%, yeah.
[04:17:33.160 --> 04:17:34.480]   - You don't think he has a chance?
[04:17:34.480 --> 04:17:35.440]   You don't think he has a chance?
[04:17:35.440 --> 04:17:37.080]   - How, what's he gonna do?
[04:17:37.080 --> 04:17:38.680]   - You don't think there's a technical,
[04:17:38.680 --> 04:17:40.280]   first of all, intelligence, so technical--
[04:17:40.280 --> 04:17:41.560]   - What's he gonna do, a heel hook?
[04:17:41.560 --> 04:17:43.360]   - No, well, first of all, maybe.
[04:17:43.360 --> 04:17:45.640]   - He can't do a double A, he's got four fucking legs.
[04:17:45.640 --> 04:17:49.280]   - Okay, what if Gordon gets any starting position he wants?
[04:17:49.280 --> 04:17:51.480]   - Ooh, yeah, that's gonna be really useful
[04:17:51.480 --> 04:17:52.320]   on a thousand-pound bear. - You don't think
[04:17:52.320 --> 04:17:53.680]   he can have back control?
[04:17:53.680 --> 04:17:54.880]   - On a thousand-pound bear?
[04:17:54.880 --> 04:17:55.720]   - Yeah.
[04:17:55.720 --> 04:17:57.200]   - What good would back control?
[04:17:57.200 --> 04:17:59.340]   Shaken off, he'll get torn off.
[04:17:59.340 --> 04:18:00.180]   - With what?
[04:18:01.240 --> 04:18:03.720]   - He reaches back, he's got four six-inch claws.
[04:18:03.720 --> 04:18:07.040]   - It's hard to, oh, okay, I wonder what is the reach.
[04:18:07.040 --> 04:18:07.880]   - Whatever he touches, he's gonna destroy it.
[04:18:07.880 --> 04:18:10.720]   - What if it's not a flexible bear?
[04:18:10.720 --> 04:18:12.320]   So you think there's no control?
[04:18:12.320 --> 04:18:13.480]   What about like a low,
[04:18:13.480 --> 04:18:17.280]   like some kind of controlling position from,
[04:18:17.280 --> 04:18:20.440]   yeah, like you said, Brambo, like from underneath?
[04:18:20.440 --> 04:18:21.280]   Nothing?
[04:18:21.280 --> 04:18:23.120]   - This discussion is so insane that
[04:18:23.120 --> 04:18:25.760]   I didn't even know where to begin criticism.
[04:18:25.760 --> 04:18:27.920]   - I don't think you're open-minded enough.
[04:18:27.920 --> 04:18:29.120]   - We could turn this down,
[04:18:29.120 --> 04:18:32.240]   forget about Gordon fighting a lion or a bear,
[04:18:32.240 --> 04:18:34.480]   that's completely impossible.
[04:18:34.480 --> 04:18:37.880]   An adult male chimp will destroy Gordon.
[04:18:37.880 --> 04:18:39.760]   - So not even a gorilla?
[04:18:39.760 --> 04:18:40.800]   - But gorilla. - What about the aggression,
[04:18:40.800 --> 04:18:42.440]   yeah, the aggression?
[04:18:42.440 --> 04:18:44.040]   - A male chimp is more than enough
[04:18:44.040 --> 04:18:46.700]   to kill any human on the planet, including Gordon Ryan.
[04:18:46.700 --> 04:18:49.560]   - So Gordon Ryan fighting a chimp,
[04:18:49.560 --> 04:18:50.920]   a good-sized-- - Did, did.
[04:18:50.920 --> 04:18:53.720]   - No, a thousand times, how many times does he win?
[04:18:53.720 --> 04:18:56.080]   - He loses a thousand times.
[04:18:56.080 --> 04:18:57.200]   It's not even competitive,
[04:18:57.200 --> 04:18:58.040]   it's not even remotely competitive.
[04:18:58.040 --> 04:19:00.320]   - Do you think he will disagree?
[04:19:00.320 --> 04:19:01.160]   - No.
[04:19:01.160 --> 04:19:03.920]   - Do you think anyone will disagree?
[04:19:03.920 --> 04:19:04.760]   Anyone?
[04:19:04.760 --> 04:19:05.720]   - Yeah, morons.
[04:19:05.720 --> 04:19:08.120]   (Lex laughing)
[04:19:08.120 --> 04:19:11.720]   - Okay, somebody that I think you might know
[04:19:11.720 --> 04:19:14.680]   is a famous actor, Tom Hardy,
[04:19:14.680 --> 04:19:17.240]   but he's also doing quite a bit of jiu-jitsu.
[04:19:17.240 --> 04:19:20.000]   The reason this makes sense to bring up now
[04:19:20.000 --> 04:19:23.840]   is he's also, I saw, narrating a new Sky original series
[04:19:23.840 --> 04:19:27.640]   called "Predators" coming out in December
[04:19:27.640 --> 04:19:29.880]   where they follow five different predators
[04:19:29.880 --> 04:19:32.360]   and tell their full story about all the fighting
[04:19:32.360 --> 04:19:33.840]   and the killing and all that kind of stuff.
[04:19:33.840 --> 04:19:34.680]   And he's doing that.
[04:19:34.680 --> 04:19:35.800]   He's like-- - Fascinating.
[04:19:35.800 --> 04:19:38.000]   - It's like Morgan-- - What are the predators?
[04:19:38.000 --> 04:19:41.840]   - It's like Morgan Freeman from "March of the Penguins."
[04:19:41.840 --> 04:19:44.400]   It's Tom Hardy for the predators.
[04:19:44.400 --> 04:19:49.400]   So I don't, I saw a bear and a lion in the trailer,
[04:19:49.400 --> 04:19:51.760]   but they also had something,
[04:19:51.760 --> 04:19:52.760]   I didn't watch it too careful,
[04:19:52.760 --> 04:19:54.320]   but they had something like a hyena.
[04:19:54.320 --> 04:19:55.920]   So I think they were talking about,
[04:19:55.920 --> 04:19:57.680]   I don't know if it's a hyena, but something like that,
[04:19:57.680 --> 04:20:00.400]   like pack animals that attack and--
[04:20:00.400 --> 04:20:03.200]   - Hyenas are formidable, formidable animals.
[04:20:03.200 --> 04:20:06.040]   - So it's not all about size, it's about strategy.
[04:20:06.040 --> 04:20:08.740]   - Yeah, the most important thing in nature is numbers.
[04:20:08.740 --> 04:20:12.360]   A pack of animals will always destroy a single animal.
[04:20:12.360 --> 04:20:13.720]   - And I think that show in particular
[04:20:13.720 --> 04:20:16.980]   is not 100% about who wins or so on.
[04:20:16.980 --> 04:20:18.460]   It's about the fascinating stories
[04:20:18.460 --> 04:20:21.440]   of how these predators
[04:20:21.440 --> 04:20:24.040]   sort of dominate their particular environment.
[04:20:24.040 --> 04:20:27.280]   'Cause it's not about these like artificial match-ups,
[04:20:27.280 --> 04:20:28.800]   it's about giving your environment,
[04:20:28.800 --> 04:20:31.300]   how do you succeed and all that kind of stuff.
[04:20:31.300 --> 04:20:34.440]   - Maybe we could do Gordon Ryan versus a house cat.
[04:20:34.440 --> 04:20:39.240]   Gordon might have a small chance against a house cat,
[04:20:39.240 --> 04:20:40.600]   maybe, maybe.
[04:20:40.600 --> 04:20:43.400]   - See, now I know you're just trolling me.
[04:20:43.400 --> 04:20:47.160]   I think Gordon has a chance against,
[04:20:47.160 --> 04:20:51.400]   well, definitely against the smaller apes,
[04:20:51.400 --> 04:20:52.720]   but I have no way of proving it.
[04:20:52.720 --> 04:20:55.440]   And the internet will say I'm an idiot, so there you go.
[04:20:55.440 --> 04:20:58.440]   - Yeah, the internet is correct every so often.
[04:20:58.440 --> 04:20:59.800]   - So there's a, oh, it's funny enough,
[04:20:59.800 --> 04:21:01.640]   I'm looking at Tom's Instagram,
[04:21:01.640 --> 04:21:02.680]   he has a picture with Hanzo.
[04:21:02.680 --> 04:21:05.560]   He's competed recently, which is very cool, in jiu-jitsu.
[04:21:05.560 --> 04:21:06.400]   - That's awesome.
[04:21:06.400 --> 04:21:08.000]   - That's tough to do for a celebrity to step up.
[04:21:08.000 --> 04:21:09.680]   - Oh yeah, absolutely, yeah.
[04:21:09.680 --> 04:21:12.560]   He used to consult with me a little bit
[04:21:12.560 --> 04:21:15.400]   on moves when he was starting out.
[04:21:15.400 --> 04:21:17.680]   He's a very, very nice person.
[04:21:17.680 --> 04:21:18.600]   - Oh, about jiu-jitsu?
[04:21:18.600 --> 04:21:20.800]   - Yeah, he asked questions about jiu-jitsu.
[04:21:20.800 --> 04:21:22.720]   He struck me as being a very, very nice person.
[04:21:22.720 --> 04:21:24.280]   - I would love to be a fly on that wall,
[04:21:24.280 --> 04:21:27.400]   but he made a post on Instagram,
[04:21:27.400 --> 04:21:29.160]   which I'd love to get your opinion on.
[04:21:29.160 --> 04:21:31.360]   It has very much like a John Donahart style
[04:21:31.360 --> 04:21:34.360]   of digging into the philosophy
[04:21:34.360 --> 04:21:37.160]   of the impact of jiu-jitsu on one's life.
[04:21:37.160 --> 04:21:40.120]   - Is his Instagram post 18 pages long?
[04:21:40.120 --> 04:21:40.960]   - Yes.
[04:21:40.960 --> 04:21:42.280]   - Oh, he's got potential then.
[04:21:42.280 --> 04:21:46.760]   - Yes, with a profound, deep picture
[04:21:46.760 --> 04:21:50.720]   of somebody practicing the art of jiu-jitsu, I think.
[04:21:50.720 --> 04:21:54.240]   - I think he's at least a trainee in this art
[04:21:54.240 --> 04:21:57.200]   of the Donahart style of communication.
[04:21:57.200 --> 04:21:59.120]   If Miyamoto Musashi would be alive today,
[04:21:59.120 --> 04:22:01.640]   he would probably be doing these five-page Instagram posts
[04:22:01.640 --> 04:22:02.480]   like you do.
[04:22:02.480 --> 04:22:05.320]   Addiction, writes Tom Hardy,
[04:22:05.320 --> 04:22:08.320]   addiction is difficult and complex stuff to navigate,
[04:22:08.320 --> 04:22:09.640]   as is mental health,
[04:22:09.640 --> 04:22:11.960]   subjects which are both deeply personal for me
[04:22:11.960 --> 04:22:13.720]   and extremely close to my heart.
[04:22:13.720 --> 04:22:15.960]   It is an honor to be able to represent the charity
[04:22:15.960 --> 04:22:18.960]   and my team, RE-ORG, and the great work they do
[04:22:18.960 --> 04:22:20.640]   supporting the mental health and wellbeing
[04:22:20.640 --> 04:22:23.520]   of veterans of service, military and first responders
[04:22:23.520 --> 04:22:25.840]   through the therapeutic benefits of jiu-jitsu
[04:22:25.840 --> 04:22:26.920]   and fitness training.
[04:22:26.920 --> 04:22:29.200]   He represented them in this competition
[04:22:29.200 --> 04:22:30.240]   that he competed in.
[04:22:30.240 --> 04:22:34.700]   Simple training, for me, as a hobby and a private love,
[04:22:34.700 --> 04:22:37.040]   has been fundamentally key to further develop
[04:22:37.040 --> 04:22:40.680]   a deeper sense of inner resilience, calm, and wellbeing.
[04:22:40.680 --> 04:22:43.040]   I can't stress the importance it has had
[04:22:43.040 --> 04:22:46.440]   and the impact of my life and my fellow teammates.
[04:22:46.440 --> 04:22:49.840]   And he goes on to talk about this organization, RE-ORG,
[04:22:49.840 --> 04:22:53.960]   that uses Brazilian jiu-jitsu to form a therapy
[04:22:53.960 --> 04:22:55.840]   to overcome physical and mental challenges,
[04:22:55.840 --> 04:22:57.100]   strengthen social connections,
[04:22:57.100 --> 04:22:59.120]   and improve overall health and wellbeing.
[04:22:59.120 --> 04:23:02.780]   This is for veterans, for people going through PTSD.
[04:23:02.780 --> 04:23:05.320]   They have saved lives around the world
[04:23:05.320 --> 04:23:07.740]   by not only providing an effective and positive means
[04:23:07.740 --> 04:23:09.240]   for navigating and managing
[04:23:09.240 --> 04:23:11.000]   the challenging psychological aspects
[04:23:11.000 --> 04:23:13.060]   of military and first responder careers,
[04:23:13.060 --> 04:23:16.760]   but also has allowed many to find a renewed sense of purpose,
[04:23:16.760 --> 04:23:20.280]   identity, and community that's often lost
[04:23:20.280 --> 04:23:22.740]   when transitioning to civilian life.
[04:23:22.740 --> 04:23:24.020]   Do you have thoughts about that,
[04:23:24.020 --> 04:23:28.000]   sort of the effects of jiu-jitsu on folks
[04:23:28.000 --> 04:23:30.160]   who've gone through some really difficult
[04:23:30.160 --> 04:23:32.640]   things in their life?
[04:23:32.640 --> 04:23:35.440]   - First off, I think that's just a beautiful statement
[04:23:35.440 --> 04:23:36.780]   by Mr. Hardy.
[04:23:36.780 --> 04:23:42.640]   I must give him a phone call after this and talk to him.
[04:23:42.640 --> 04:23:44.100]   That was beautiful to read.
[04:23:44.340 --> 04:23:47.020]   (Luke chuckles)
[04:23:47.020 --> 04:23:50.260]   One thing that's always struck me
[04:23:50.260 --> 04:23:55.060]   when I train people who either have a military background
[04:23:55.060 --> 04:23:58.540]   or on more than a few occasions,
[04:23:58.540 --> 04:24:01.040]   we have special forces soldiers come in
[04:24:01.040 --> 04:24:03.620]   and train with us for a week or two.
[04:24:03.620 --> 04:24:06.400]   And when you talk to them,
[04:24:06.400 --> 04:24:12.660]   the overwhelming sentiment I get
[04:24:12.660 --> 04:24:15.260]   when the conversation's over and we go our separate ways
[04:24:15.260 --> 04:24:17.740]   is I'm always asking myself,
[04:24:17.740 --> 04:24:20.380]   the transition from military life,
[04:24:20.380 --> 04:24:22.460]   especially the more extreme military lives
[04:24:22.460 --> 04:24:27.460]   of special forces soldiers, back to civilian life,
[04:24:27.460 --> 04:24:32.300]   it must be the craziest experience of all.
[04:24:32.300 --> 04:24:38.620]   You've got people who are fighting and dying
[04:24:40.420 --> 04:24:45.420]   alongside their comrades in the most extreme circumstances
[04:24:45.420 --> 04:24:48.660]   that any human being can go through.
[04:24:48.660 --> 04:24:51.140]   And then they're pulled back into a life
[04:24:51.140 --> 04:24:56.140]   where people are arguing with them over parking spots.
[04:24:56.140 --> 04:25:00.240]   Just like the average person's day-to-day life
[04:25:00.240 --> 04:25:04.020]   is so mundane that imagine what must be going
[04:25:04.020 --> 04:25:08.540]   through a man's head who a few weeks or months ago
[04:25:08.540 --> 04:25:10.460]   was literally fighting for his life
[04:25:10.460 --> 04:25:12.340]   and his comrades' lives,
[04:25:12.340 --> 04:25:14.980]   watching people that he loved die
[04:25:14.980 --> 04:25:17.020]   or get mutilated in front of him.
[04:25:17.020 --> 04:25:21.340]   Things that in a matter of seconds,
[04:25:21.340 --> 04:25:24.460]   people's lives can be torn apart and changed forever.
[04:25:24.460 --> 04:25:26.300]   And then suddenly you get thrown into a life
[04:25:26.300 --> 04:25:30.660]   where people are arguing over who's cut who off,
[04:25:30.660 --> 04:25:32.940]   who in line to buy a coffee.
[04:25:32.940 --> 04:25:35.260]   - The intensity of camaraderie and love
[04:25:35.260 --> 04:25:36.420]   that you have for each other.
[04:25:36.420 --> 04:25:40.100]   - And then you go from incredible intensity in war
[04:25:40.100 --> 04:25:45.100]   to just mundane, boring life.
[04:25:45.100 --> 04:25:47.740]   And going from one to the other
[04:25:47.740 --> 04:25:51.540]   where people are yelling at you or nagging you
[04:25:51.540 --> 04:25:54.540]   over issues that just seem so inconsequential
[04:25:54.540 --> 04:25:56.920]   compared to what you've been through.
[04:25:56.920 --> 04:25:59.280]   And you're supposed to take these people seriously
[04:25:59.280 --> 04:26:00.300]   and listen to them.
[04:26:00.300 --> 04:26:05.300]   - But not only that, you do have trauma visions
[04:26:05.360 --> 04:26:09.700]   of dead brothers and sisters.
[04:26:09.700 --> 04:26:12.560]   And you feel like you can't really talk
[04:26:12.560 --> 04:26:14.680]   to these civilians about it.
[04:26:14.680 --> 04:26:17.120]   - There's nothing in their experience
[04:26:17.120 --> 04:26:19.140]   that would enable you to have a conversation with them.
[04:26:19.140 --> 04:26:21.320]   Like they don't even,
[04:26:21.320 --> 04:26:24.120]   how do you talk to your new girlfriend
[04:26:24.120 --> 04:26:27.600]   about watching one of your friend's legs get taken off?
[04:26:27.600 --> 04:26:30.300]   Like there's no conversation you could have with them.
[04:26:31.760 --> 04:26:36.760]   So I find that typically they do best
[04:26:36.760 --> 04:26:40.160]   when they hang out with each other
[04:26:40.160 --> 04:26:41.520]   'cause they have shared experience
[04:26:41.520 --> 04:26:43.360]   and they can talk about these things.
[04:26:43.360 --> 04:26:48.840]   But I do find that most judice schools
[04:26:48.840 --> 04:26:53.560]   have something like a kind of military barracks
[04:26:53.560 --> 04:26:58.960]   demeanor to them of like camaraderie,
[04:26:58.960 --> 04:27:03.960]   hard work, shared hard work, teamwork,
[04:27:03.960 --> 04:27:07.720]   building towards a goal over time,
[04:27:07.720 --> 04:27:09.400]   the acquisition of skills.
[04:27:09.400 --> 04:27:12.060]   Usually along with that, a kind of,
[04:27:12.060 --> 04:27:14.600]   for want of a better word,
[04:27:14.600 --> 04:27:16.560]   rustic and primitive sense of humor
[04:27:16.560 --> 04:27:20.280]   and a kind of soldierly way of talking to each other
[04:27:20.280 --> 04:27:24.520]   and disparaging, self-deprecating sense of humor.
[04:27:24.520 --> 04:27:26.200]   And it's something that most people
[04:27:26.200 --> 04:27:29.520]   with military service kind of naturally come into
[04:27:29.520 --> 04:27:31.040]   'cause it's part of what they were in.
[04:27:31.040 --> 04:27:33.240]   And so it's like a toned down version of it
[04:27:33.240 --> 04:27:37.240]   which enables them to form a stepping stone
[04:27:37.240 --> 04:27:42.240]   between the military life that they were in
[04:27:42.240 --> 04:27:45.320]   all the way down to civilian life.
[04:27:45.320 --> 04:27:49.360]   And jiu-jitsu was kind of like a bridge between those two.
[04:27:49.360 --> 04:27:50.400]   - And also the honesty.
[04:27:50.400 --> 04:27:52.760]   So you said like the skill acquisition,
[04:27:52.760 --> 04:27:55.700]   the honesty of really testing that skill.
[04:27:55.700 --> 04:28:00.700]   There is a deep honesty to war in a distant way,
[04:28:00.700 --> 04:28:04.360]   but in a way there's an honesty to jiu-jitsu
[04:28:04.360 --> 04:28:06.040]   of technique working and not.
[04:28:06.040 --> 04:28:08.640]   And there's a final, there is simulated death.
[04:28:08.640 --> 04:28:11.520]   It's not real death, it's simulated death on the mat.
[04:28:11.520 --> 04:28:13.240]   And there's a similar kind of honesty there.
[04:28:13.240 --> 04:28:17.640]   - And there's also a similar kind of esteem towards skill.
[04:28:17.640 --> 04:28:20.800]   Just as regular soldiers look up to special forces soldiers
[04:28:20.800 --> 04:28:22.760]   'cause they see them as people who have
[04:28:24.680 --> 04:28:26.980]   a greater skill than themselves, something to aspire to.
[04:28:26.980 --> 04:28:30.540]   So too in jiu-jitsu, the thing that we esteem most
[04:28:30.540 --> 04:28:32.300]   on a jiu-jitsu mat is skill.
[04:28:32.300 --> 04:28:34.380]   No one gives a damn what you look like
[04:28:34.380 --> 04:28:38.500]   or what you think, you're judged mostly by your skill level.
[04:28:38.500 --> 04:28:43.380]   And so they tend to identify with that.
[04:28:43.380 --> 04:28:48.100]   I do think that most people from a military background
[04:28:48.100 --> 04:28:50.660]   kind of find a natural gravitation
[04:28:50.660 --> 04:28:54.620]   towards the atmosphere of jiu-jitsu learning.
[04:28:54.620 --> 04:28:58.320]   And if it proves to be a positive way for them
[04:28:58.320 --> 04:29:01.240]   to rehabilitate and come back into civilian life,
[04:29:01.240 --> 04:29:03.800]   then that's a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[04:29:03.800 --> 04:29:07.840]   I know we're linked with We Defy,
[04:29:07.840 --> 04:29:12.840]   which is an organization which caters to former soldiers
[04:29:12.840 --> 04:29:16.040]   who were badly injured in combat,
[04:29:16.040 --> 04:29:18.840]   and many of whom lost limbs and,
[04:29:18.840 --> 04:29:22.660]   or suffered mental trauma.
[04:29:22.660 --> 04:29:25.120]   And they come in and train,
[04:29:25.120 --> 04:29:28.080]   and they often speak very, very highly
[04:29:28.080 --> 04:29:31.240]   of the degree to which jiu-jitsu has helped them
[04:29:31.240 --> 04:29:32.560]   come back into civilian life.
[04:29:32.560 --> 04:29:33.920]   And for them, it's even worse
[04:29:33.920 --> 04:29:36.180]   because they come back not only mentally,
[04:29:36.180 --> 04:29:40.360]   but physically disadvantaged after war.
[04:29:40.360 --> 04:29:45.360]   And I've always been proud to be associated with We Defy.
[04:29:45.360 --> 04:29:47.840]   And I'm very happy to see Tom
[04:29:47.840 --> 04:29:49.660]   working with this organization.
[04:29:49.660 --> 04:29:51.500]   Is this an organization based in England
[04:29:51.500 --> 04:29:54.360]   for English veterans, or is it international?
[04:29:54.360 --> 04:29:55.200]   - That's a good question.
[04:29:55.200 --> 04:29:56.200]   I'd have to look into it.
[04:29:56.200 --> 04:30:00.320]   It certainly is based in England,
[04:30:00.320 --> 04:30:02.600]   but it could be international.
[04:30:02.600 --> 04:30:05.440]   But it's just nice to see somebody
[04:30:05.440 --> 04:30:08.080]   use that large platform for that kind of message.
[04:30:08.080 --> 04:30:11.600]   And also to step on the mat
[04:30:11.600 --> 04:30:13.720]   and show the kind of jiu-jitsu you would probably
[04:30:13.720 --> 04:30:15.780]   be proud of, which is chasing submissions.
[04:30:15.780 --> 04:30:19.020]   You got an arm lock, you got a straight foot lock.
[04:30:19.020 --> 04:30:21.520]   We're not gonna analyze the techniques
[04:30:21.520 --> 04:30:23.000]   'cause there could be-
[04:30:23.000 --> 04:30:23.840]   - Doesn't matter.
[04:30:23.840 --> 04:30:25.400]   Different perspectives. - It's the intent that counts.
[04:30:25.400 --> 04:30:27.160]   - The finish is the finish.
[04:30:27.160 --> 04:30:29.160]   - Yeah, no, that's impressive.
[04:30:29.160 --> 04:30:30.320]   He's actually quite an athlete.
[04:30:30.320 --> 04:30:35.320]   He's in great shape and strong and flexible.
[04:30:35.320 --> 04:30:38.120]   And I'm glad he's doing well with his jiu-jitsu.
[04:30:38.120 --> 04:30:40.720]   - And it's good to see Henzo's smiling face next to him.
[04:30:40.720 --> 04:30:42.960]   I can only imagine the conversations.
[04:30:42.960 --> 04:30:47.960]   I have to ask you a deep and important question.
[04:30:48.440 --> 04:30:50.580]   You often, when we text back and forth,
[04:30:50.580 --> 04:30:52.880]   send me two hugging emojis.
[04:30:52.880 --> 04:30:56.260]   Can we psychoanalyze the reason
[04:30:56.260 --> 04:31:00.460]   why that's your favorite emoji of the hugging face?
[04:31:00.460 --> 04:31:04.180]   Is that, it's kind of like sending a heart,
[04:31:04.180 --> 04:31:08.360]   but a little bit more gender neutral.
[04:31:08.360 --> 04:31:13.380]   - When jiu-jitsu players meet each other,
[04:31:13.380 --> 04:31:15.860]   they often shake hands and then give a quick hug.
[04:31:15.860 --> 04:31:18.100]   So I thought it was the most appropriate emoji
[04:31:18.100 --> 04:31:19.940]   for jiu-jitsu players.
[04:31:19.940 --> 04:31:20.780]   - I see.
[04:31:20.780 --> 04:31:22.340]   - It's a pretty simple explanation.
[04:31:22.340 --> 04:31:23.700]   Nothing too fraudy in there.
[04:31:23.700 --> 04:31:25.220]   - Are you sure?
[04:31:25.220 --> 04:31:26.060]   - Quite sure.
[04:31:26.060 --> 04:31:26.880]   - Okay.
[04:31:26.880 --> 04:31:28.620]   Have you really asked yourself deeply?
[04:31:28.620 --> 04:31:30.060]   'Cause you really lean on that emoji.
[04:31:30.060 --> 04:31:31.460]   Is there something behind it?
[04:31:31.460 --> 04:31:32.420]   - Tomorrow I'm never gonna use that emoji again.
[04:31:32.420 --> 04:31:33.660]   - Why is there two of them?
[04:31:33.660 --> 04:31:34.860]   (laughing)
[04:31:34.860 --> 04:31:36.380]   Walk away.
[04:31:36.380 --> 04:31:39.300]   - I'll shock you tomorrow and hit you with three.
[04:31:39.300 --> 04:31:40.140]   - Three.
[04:31:40.140 --> 04:31:42.340]   It's almost always two.
[04:31:42.340 --> 04:31:46.140]   I think maybe you're a creature of habit in communication.
[04:31:46.140 --> 04:31:46.980]   There's a--
[04:31:46.980 --> 04:31:49.420]   - I'm a creature of habit in almost every aspect of my life.
[04:31:49.420 --> 04:31:51.080]   So even emojis.
[04:31:51.080 --> 04:31:54.420]   - Yeah, you fall into these little pockets
[04:31:54.420 --> 04:31:55.360]   of how you communicate,
[04:31:55.360 --> 04:31:58.260]   how you show affection towards others.
[04:31:58.260 --> 04:32:00.300]   I send, I say love a lot.
[04:32:00.300 --> 04:32:05.300]   I send hearts and don't give a fuck if it's too like,
[04:32:05.300 --> 04:32:07.380]   you know, like in a, you know,
[04:32:07.380 --> 04:32:10.260]   me sending a message to like a CEO I'm about to interview,
[04:32:10.260 --> 04:32:11.140]   I'll send a heart.
[04:32:11.140 --> 04:32:12.760]   I don't give a damn.
[04:32:12.760 --> 04:32:15.540]   They'll probably just like, look, what is this?
[04:32:15.540 --> 04:32:20.540]   But I think people are too afraid
[04:32:20.540 --> 04:32:24.620]   of simple communication of affection.
[04:32:24.620 --> 04:32:28.140]   Like it could be in any form,
[04:32:28.140 --> 04:32:31.560]   but there's a hesitance to that
[04:32:31.560 --> 04:32:33.780]   because I think underneath it,
[04:32:33.780 --> 04:32:35.900]   in order to show affection,
[04:32:35.900 --> 04:32:40.360]   you're taking a risk and you're showing vulnerability
[04:32:40.360 --> 04:32:42.540]   because if you show affection
[04:32:42.540 --> 04:32:45.580]   and the other person rejects that affection,
[04:32:45.580 --> 04:32:49.340]   you've now placed yourself in a hierarchy,
[04:32:49.340 --> 04:32:53.260]   going back to lions of like, oh, this person,
[04:32:53.260 --> 04:32:55.040]   you're just like the silly weak person
[04:32:55.040 --> 04:32:56.460]   and they're the strong person.
[04:32:56.460 --> 04:32:58.940]   I think that's how you might see it, I guess,
[04:32:58.940 --> 04:32:59.900]   but I don't.
[04:32:59.900 --> 04:33:02.940]   To me, the display of vulnerability
[04:33:02.940 --> 04:33:07.940]   is a display of strength, not weakness,
[04:33:07.940 --> 04:33:11.180]   at least in human society, at least at this time.
[04:33:11.180 --> 04:33:12.220]   I don't know.
[04:33:12.220 --> 04:33:13.560]   Let me ask you about love.
[04:33:13.560 --> 04:33:18.420]   I must ask John Donahy about love.
[04:33:18.420 --> 04:33:19.980]   What do you think is the role of love
[04:33:19.980 --> 04:33:23.060]   in the human condition at the highest philosophical level,
[04:33:23.060 --> 04:33:24.200]   let me first ask?
[04:33:24.200 --> 04:33:25.040]   What's--
[04:33:25.040 --> 04:33:28.660]   - Like romantic love?
[04:33:28.660 --> 04:33:30.660]   - Romantic love, let's say romantic love.
[04:33:30.660 --> 04:33:35.660]   - I have one or two areas of apparent expertise in my life.
[04:33:35.660 --> 04:33:39.940]   Romantic love, definitely not one of them.
[04:33:39.940 --> 04:33:41.980]   - So like lions versus bears.
[04:33:41.980 --> 04:33:42.820]   - I'm good.
[04:33:42.820 --> 04:33:43.640]   - Animal combat.
[04:33:43.640 --> 04:33:44.480]   - I'm good.
[04:33:44.480 --> 04:33:46.540]   - Pretty good at, and then different grappling arts,
[04:33:46.540 --> 04:33:48.460]   judo, sambo, jiu-jitsu.
[04:33:48.460 --> 04:33:49.820]   - Decent.
[04:33:49.820 --> 04:33:53.260]   - Wrestling, MMA, so fighting and so on.
[04:33:53.260 --> 04:33:54.260]   - Romantic love.
[04:33:54.260 --> 04:33:55.580]   - You don't see them as similar.
[04:33:55.580 --> 04:33:56.700]   It's a kind of fight.
[04:33:56.700 --> 04:33:59.780]   It's a kind of dance.
[04:33:59.780 --> 04:34:00.780]   By the way, do you--
[04:34:00.780 --> 04:34:05.820]   - There's a sense in which I'm kind of glad
[04:34:05.820 --> 04:34:07.860]   I'm not an expert on that.
[04:34:07.860 --> 04:34:12.860]   Imagine what it would be to be an expert on romantic love.
[04:34:12.860 --> 04:34:14.340]   You would take the one thing in life
[04:34:14.340 --> 04:34:17.180]   that's actually interesting and make it boring
[04:34:17.180 --> 04:34:20.860]   because once you develop an expertise about something,
[04:34:20.860 --> 04:34:23.300]   you can start to predict how things are gonna unfold.
[04:34:23.300 --> 04:34:26.500]   You get answers before events even occur.
[04:34:26.500 --> 04:34:30.220]   You see, you can read into the future of everything.
[04:34:30.220 --> 04:34:32.420]   I think there are certain parts of human life
[04:34:32.420 --> 04:34:34.900]   where you want to be a beginner at all times
[04:34:34.900 --> 04:34:36.860]   and you don't wanna gain expertise.
[04:34:36.860 --> 04:34:39.820]   - So excellence and systematizing something
[04:34:39.820 --> 04:34:40.940]   in order to achieve excellence
[04:34:40.940 --> 04:34:41.780]   might destroy the very magic of the thing.
[04:34:41.780 --> 04:34:42.780]   - Yes, yes.
[04:34:42.780 --> 04:34:45.300]   And I think that the magic of romantic love
[04:34:45.300 --> 04:34:47.460]   is the fact that we're all beginners at it.
[04:34:47.460 --> 04:34:50.540]   And the minute you try to gain expertise in it,
[04:34:50.540 --> 04:34:51.700]   what does that even mean?
[04:34:51.700 --> 04:34:52.700]   What would it mean?
[04:34:52.700 --> 04:34:53.620]   And would it be good?
[04:34:53.620 --> 04:34:54.460]   I don't think it would.
[04:34:54.460 --> 04:34:58.020]   I think you're better off just having fun with it
[04:34:58.020 --> 04:35:00.100]   and plowing through and making dumb mistakes
[04:35:00.100 --> 04:35:01.300]   and looking like a fool.
[04:35:03.820 --> 04:35:07.860]   And then whatever success, whatever that means,
[04:35:07.860 --> 04:35:10.820]   comes in a kind of lighthearted, frivolous kind of way.
[04:35:10.820 --> 04:35:15.820]   And that I think is, over the course of a lifetime,
[04:35:15.820 --> 04:35:19.580]   far more desirable than having expertise
[04:35:19.580 --> 04:35:21.060]   and affairs of love.
[04:35:21.060 --> 04:35:24.220]   So I don't think it's even a good thing to study too much.
[04:35:24.220 --> 04:35:25.660]   And I think if you did,
[04:35:25.660 --> 04:35:29.140]   you would actually take something good out of your life.
[04:35:29.140 --> 04:35:33.140]   - Yeah, there's communities of people called pickup artists
[04:35:33.140 --> 04:35:36.580]   that try to optimize this particular aspect,
[04:35:36.580 --> 04:35:40.260]   which is of dating, of guys picking up girls,
[04:35:40.260 --> 04:35:41.780]   and turning that into a system
[04:35:41.780 --> 04:35:43.100]   and seeing what's the most successful.
[04:35:43.100 --> 04:35:44.660]   - Yeah, I think that would be,
[04:35:44.660 --> 04:35:48.380]   I mean, maybe the first few months would be good.
[04:35:48.380 --> 04:35:50.900]   And then after that, I think it would be a disaster.
[04:35:50.900 --> 04:35:57.540]   I mean, given that humans are fairly easy to study
[04:35:59.220 --> 04:36:03.260]   from the standpoint of psychology,
[04:36:03.260 --> 04:36:06.220]   I'm sure it's not that difficult to gain expertise
[04:36:06.220 --> 04:36:08.980]   in things like picking people up,
[04:36:08.980 --> 04:36:11.360]   the same way advertisers can pick up your attention
[04:36:11.360 --> 04:36:12.200]   to sell a product.
[04:36:12.200 --> 04:36:16.140]   You can do the same thing, presumably, with romance and sex.
[04:36:16.140 --> 04:36:21.140]   But I don't know, I feel like if you became very good at it,
[04:36:21.140 --> 04:36:26.820]   you would end up being very disappointed by the results.
[04:36:26.820 --> 04:36:30.460]   And so as I said, I think there's some things in life
[04:36:30.460 --> 04:36:31.500]   where it's better to be a beginner.
[04:36:31.500 --> 04:36:32.980]   - And this is one of those.
[04:36:32.980 --> 04:36:36.740]   Enjoy the chaos, the push and pull of being a beginner,
[04:36:36.740 --> 04:36:38.020]   and make that a lifelong journey.
[04:36:38.020 --> 04:36:40.540]   That's really inspiring to hear you say that.
[04:36:40.540 --> 04:36:42.060]   And there's a deep truth to that.
[04:36:42.060 --> 04:36:44.460]   - That also justifies the fact that I suck at it.
[04:36:44.460 --> 04:36:46.820]   (both laughing)
[04:36:46.820 --> 04:36:49.540]   - I think it also justifies, and it would sell very well,
[04:36:49.540 --> 04:36:51.860]   that John Donner should write a book on dating.
[04:36:51.860 --> 04:36:55.240]   And that would be chapter one, embrace being a beginner.
[04:36:55.240 --> 04:36:57.180]   Chapter two will be bear versus lion.
[04:36:57.180 --> 04:36:59.900]   - Pivot quickly to violence.
[04:36:59.900 --> 04:37:02.240]   - By the way, we totally skipped over anaconda.
[04:37:02.240 --> 04:37:06.320]   - I assumed the implied--
[04:37:06.320 --> 04:37:10.620]   - I'll put it to you this way.
[04:37:10.620 --> 04:37:15.620]   On video, you can watch Puma and similar-sized cats,
[04:37:15.620 --> 04:37:23.940]   jaguar, destroy anacondas.
[04:37:23.940 --> 04:37:28.500]   Even in water, which is anaconda's preferred domain.
[04:37:28.500 --> 04:37:33.500]   So given that Puma and jaguar are several orders below lion,
[04:37:33.500 --> 04:37:36.980]   you have to go with the idea
[04:37:36.980 --> 04:37:40.300]   that lion would utterly decimate anaconda.
[04:37:40.300 --> 04:37:42.820]   So it's probably good that we did skip over it.
[04:37:42.820 --> 04:37:45.740]   - And I think going back to the original thought
[04:37:45.740 --> 04:37:49.660]   that you had about this, don't trust your first instinct.
[04:37:49.660 --> 04:37:51.940]   - Also, think about the other elements.
[04:37:51.940 --> 04:37:54.860]   An anaconda has no ability to disengage from the fight.
[04:37:54.860 --> 04:37:58.220]   Once the fight's on, it's gotta go until the end.
[04:37:58.220 --> 04:38:00.460]   It has no ability to disengage and get away.
[04:38:00.460 --> 04:38:03.780]   Its only hope would be ambush,
[04:38:03.780 --> 04:38:06.700]   and it's got a tiny, tiny chance
[04:38:06.700 --> 04:38:10.220]   against a truly formidable animal.
[04:38:10.220 --> 04:38:13.300]   And the fact that if we look at actual,
[04:38:13.300 --> 04:38:14.780]   concrete, real-world results,
[04:38:14.780 --> 04:38:18.300]   when Puma and jaguar are kicking your ass,
[04:38:18.300 --> 04:38:21.620]   lion and bear, it's gonna be a lot worse.
[04:38:21.620 --> 04:38:25.100]   Science is not to be found on YouTube,
[04:38:25.100 --> 04:38:26.780]   or rather, YouTube is not science.
[04:38:26.780 --> 04:38:30.500]   I bet you there's a bear somewhere in Canada
[04:38:30.500 --> 04:38:32.180]   that has seen some shit.
[04:38:32.180 --> 04:38:33.780]   I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[04:38:33.780 --> 04:38:37.220]   You're a fan of knives.
[04:38:37.220 --> 04:38:43.180]   There's guys like Miyamoto Musashi,
[04:38:43.180 --> 04:38:48.180]   who instead of doing who's number one type of tournaments,
[04:38:48.180 --> 04:38:50.860]   when both competitors walk away,
[04:38:50.860 --> 04:38:52.680]   only one competitor walks away.
[04:38:52.680 --> 04:38:58.340]   Miyamoto Musashi is known for somebody having
[04:38:58.340 --> 04:39:02.060]   John Donaher-like philosophical skills,
[04:39:02.060 --> 04:39:07.060]   but also is known for having fought 61 duels to the death
[04:39:07.060 --> 04:39:11.220]   and won them, obviously. - Incredible.
[04:39:11.220 --> 04:39:13.640]   - What do you think made him so good?
[04:39:13.640 --> 04:39:15.820]   - I don't feel qualified to talk about him
[04:39:15.820 --> 04:39:17.460]   because I haven't made an in-depth study
[04:39:17.460 --> 04:39:18.660]   of his life and times.
[04:39:18.660 --> 04:39:23.660]   And we also don't know how much truth there is
[04:39:23.660 --> 04:39:26.240]   to his recollections,
[04:39:26.240 --> 04:39:28.260]   and there's a lot of controversy over this.
[04:39:28.260 --> 04:39:32.100]   So I don't feel like you can give a definitive statement.
[04:39:32.100 --> 04:39:35.540]   And certainly I can't give a definitive statement
[04:39:35.540 --> 04:39:40.540]   of his prowess, but his writings are fascinating
[04:39:40.540 --> 04:39:42.860]   and deeply insightful.
[04:39:42.860 --> 04:39:46.180]   But as to what actually happened out there in his duels,
[04:39:46.180 --> 04:39:47.180]   it's unclear.
[04:39:47.180 --> 04:39:49.940]   - But there is, with guys like that,
[04:39:49.940 --> 04:39:53.060]   you almost certainly know that they were people
[04:39:53.060 --> 04:39:58.060]   like the character he projects that have existed.
[04:39:58.060 --> 04:40:00.540]   Whether it's 61, whether it's 20,
[04:40:00.540 --> 04:40:03.460]   but people really put their life on the line
[04:40:03.460 --> 04:40:05.700]   in a different time in human history.
[04:40:05.700 --> 04:40:06.940]   Is there something compelling to you
[04:40:06.940 --> 04:40:08.660]   about fighting to the death?
[04:40:08.660 --> 04:40:11.580]   - I think it's not just compelling to me, but to anyone.
[04:40:11.580 --> 04:40:14.980]   I mean, there's nothing we value more than our lives.
[04:40:14.980 --> 04:40:18.220]   And to be able to say, "I'm prepared to die
[04:40:18.220 --> 04:40:20.740]   for a sense of honor,"
[04:40:20.740 --> 04:40:23.880]   things that are so foreign to our modern society.
[04:40:23.880 --> 04:40:28.460]   Imagine, we criticize people for something as simple
[04:40:28.460 --> 04:40:32.460]   as like road rage, and yet you can imagine someone
[04:40:32.460 --> 04:40:35.300]   who has a sufficiently developed sense of honor,
[04:40:35.300 --> 04:40:37.060]   if you took them out of the 17th century
[04:40:37.060 --> 04:40:38.820]   and put them in a modern car,
[04:40:38.820 --> 04:40:40.500]   they might be killing people on the side of the road
[04:40:40.500 --> 04:40:44.900]   on a regular basis, just over smaller stacks of honor.
[04:40:44.900 --> 04:40:49.540]   To say that your sense of self overwhelms
[04:40:49.540 --> 04:40:51.740]   your sense of self-preservation,
[04:40:51.740 --> 04:40:53.700]   it's a very unusual thing in the modern age,
[04:40:53.700 --> 04:40:57.060]   and yet it appears to have been quite common back then.
[04:40:57.060 --> 04:40:59.300]   - You often wear a fanny pack.
[04:40:59.300 --> 04:41:02.180]   I'm not gonna ask you what's inside the fanny pack,
[04:41:02.180 --> 04:41:05.340]   but if you were to design a perfect killing machine
[04:41:05.340 --> 04:41:07.460]   that also wore a fanny pack,
[04:41:07.460 --> 04:41:12.460]   what would you put in that fanny pack?
[04:41:12.660 --> 04:41:15.700]   Would it be something mundane and practical,
[04:41:15.700 --> 04:41:20.700]   or would it be something surprising and hilarious?
[04:41:20.700 --> 04:41:25.860]   Would it be something of philosophical significance,
[04:41:25.860 --> 04:41:28.140]   or maybe sentimental significance,
[04:41:28.140 --> 04:41:31.140]   or would it be empty as a troll on human civilization?
[04:41:31.140 --> 04:41:32.620]   - But if it was a perfect killing machine,
[04:41:32.620 --> 04:41:34.620]   it would have to be some kind of weapon.
[04:41:34.620 --> 04:41:38.620]   - Put in a fanny pack.
[04:41:38.620 --> 04:41:40.720]   - It has to be a very compact weapon.
[04:41:41.720 --> 04:41:43.880]   (inhales)
[04:41:43.880 --> 04:41:48.080]   - We mentioned offline that there's also things
[04:41:48.080 --> 04:41:51.440]   in the chess world where there is a different kind
[04:41:51.440 --> 04:41:53.640]   of vibrating devices that could be used
[04:41:53.640 --> 04:41:58.640]   to communicate information in communication
[04:41:58.640 --> 04:42:00.240]   with the AI systems that can help you
[04:42:00.240 --> 04:42:01.480]   in your particular pursuit.
[04:42:01.480 --> 04:42:03.440]   I don't think in jiu-jitsu you need,
[04:42:03.440 --> 04:42:06.800]   it's possible for a machine to give you information
[04:42:06.800 --> 04:42:08.640]   that gives you advantage.
[04:42:08.640 --> 04:42:10.960]   You can in chess and in poker,
[04:42:10.960 --> 04:42:13.020]   so you could put one of those vibrating devices
[04:42:13.020 --> 04:42:15.920]   in your fanny pack, but in jiu-jitsu it would not help you.
[04:42:15.920 --> 04:42:20.200]   Any idea what kind of weapon?
[04:42:20.200 --> 04:42:23.280]   - To fit in a fanny pack?
[04:42:23.280 --> 04:42:24.400]   - So you're a fan of knives.
[04:42:24.400 --> 04:42:26.680]   Where's the interest in knives come from, by the way?
[04:42:26.680 --> 04:42:28.800]   - That's more metaphorical.
[04:42:28.800 --> 04:42:32.840]   The truth is that in the modern world,
[04:42:32.840 --> 04:42:34.840]   a knife is not an efficient weapon.
[04:42:34.840 --> 04:42:36.760]   Easily be overwhelmed by firearms.
[04:42:38.600 --> 04:42:41.880]   My fascination with knives comes more in the sense
[04:42:41.880 --> 04:42:45.080]   that they convey a spirit to my students
[04:42:45.080 --> 04:42:50.080]   where a knife is made of steel
[04:42:50.080 --> 04:42:53.160]   and steel begins as ore in the ground.
[04:42:53.160 --> 04:42:58.160]   It's an ugly, unfinished product,
[04:42:58.160 --> 04:43:03.000]   which through the enactment of knowledge,
[04:43:03.000 --> 04:43:05.640]   time, and discipline can be transformed
[04:43:05.640 --> 04:43:08.480]   into beautiful, shining steel.
[04:43:08.480 --> 04:43:09.600]   It can have something which,
[04:43:09.600 --> 04:43:12.680]   it begins as something which has no real function
[04:43:12.680 --> 04:43:14.160]   and becomes one of the most functional
[04:43:14.160 --> 04:43:16.900]   and important tools in all of human history,
[04:43:16.900 --> 04:43:18.920]   without which human civilization
[04:43:18.920 --> 04:43:20.480]   could never have even begun.
[04:43:20.480 --> 04:43:23.240]   It's what separated humans and took us
[04:43:23.240 --> 04:43:24.880]   from the bottom of the food chain
[04:43:24.880 --> 04:43:27.000]   and began our gradual rise towards the top
[04:43:27.000 --> 04:43:28.220]   of the food chain.
[04:43:28.220 --> 04:43:32.300]   So it has immense historical and cultural value,
[04:43:32.300 --> 04:43:34.040]   but it has this metaphorical value
[04:43:34.040 --> 04:43:36.760]   insofar as the martial artist begins
[04:43:36.760 --> 04:43:39.200]   as a white belt like iron ore,
[04:43:39.200 --> 04:43:42.480]   but over time transforms into some beautiful,
[04:43:42.480 --> 04:43:46.720]   shining steel which can have immense value.
[04:43:46.720 --> 04:43:52.320]   In addition, there's a sense of maintenance.
[04:43:52.320 --> 04:43:54.340]   As remarkable as steel is,
[04:43:54.340 --> 04:43:57.880]   it is in need of constant maintenance.
[04:43:57.880 --> 04:44:00.100]   It will fall apart through rust
[04:44:00.100 --> 04:44:02.560]   and neglect will destroy a blade,
[04:44:02.560 --> 04:44:06.040]   both in terms of rust and the edge falling apart.
[04:44:06.040 --> 04:44:08.440]   And so just as the martial artist,
[04:44:08.440 --> 04:44:10.960]   it's not good enough just to learn the techniques,
[04:44:10.960 --> 04:44:13.560]   you need to maintain them over time.
[04:44:13.560 --> 04:44:15.400]   And just as steel is perishable,
[04:44:15.400 --> 04:44:17.760]   so too are the skills of martial arts.
[04:44:17.760 --> 04:44:21.040]   And that when I give a gift of a knife to a student,
[04:44:21.040 --> 04:44:23.560]   these metaphorical elements start to emerge.
[04:44:23.560 --> 04:44:26.400]   They see, okay, I began as iron ore
[04:44:26.400 --> 04:44:28.400]   and I wanna become the finished blade.
[04:44:28.400 --> 04:44:34.320]   There's another sense in which
[04:44:34.320 --> 04:44:36.960]   a knife is morally neutral.
[04:44:36.960 --> 04:44:41.520]   A knife can be used to save a life.
[04:44:41.520 --> 04:44:43.100]   It can be used to cook a meal,
[04:44:43.100 --> 04:44:45.920]   but it can also be used for murder
[04:44:45.920 --> 04:44:47.720]   for the worst possible purposes.
[04:44:47.720 --> 04:44:51.780]   Jiu-Jitsu is the same way.
[04:44:51.780 --> 04:44:53.480]   Jiu-Jitsu can make you a better person,
[04:44:53.480 --> 04:44:54.720]   it can make you a worse person.
[04:44:54.720 --> 04:44:56.160]   Jiu-Jitsu is just a power.
[04:44:56.160 --> 04:44:59.540]   It's not a particularly great power, but it is a power.
[04:44:59.540 --> 04:45:02.320]   And like all power, it can be used for both good and bad.
[04:45:02.320 --> 04:45:03.920]   It's morally neutral in itself
[04:45:03.920 --> 04:45:05.840]   and it's up to us to make sure
[04:45:05.840 --> 04:45:07.960]   that just as the knife gets used
[04:45:07.960 --> 04:45:10.240]   for good purposes rather than bad,
[04:45:10.240 --> 04:45:12.360]   so too that Jiu-Jitsu be used
[04:45:12.360 --> 04:45:14.760]   for good purposes rather than bad.
[04:45:14.760 --> 04:45:16.360]   There's also an element where
[04:45:16.360 --> 04:45:20.820]   the basis of the knife is steel.
[04:45:20.820 --> 04:45:25.360]   And historically, there's always been a riddle of steel,
[04:45:25.360 --> 04:45:29.920]   which is steel has the property of both
[04:45:31.520 --> 04:45:33.680]   hardness and suppleness.
[04:45:33.680 --> 04:45:37.700]   The harder you make steel,
[04:45:37.700 --> 04:45:40.760]   the better its edge retention becomes.
[04:45:40.760 --> 04:45:43.200]   The longer that edge will stay sharp.
[04:45:43.200 --> 04:45:46.360]   This is good, but it comes at a price.
[04:45:46.360 --> 04:45:50.000]   The harder you make steel, the more brittle it becomes.
[04:45:50.000 --> 04:45:53.600]   And now that edge can be damaged easily.
[04:45:53.600 --> 04:46:00.580]   So the solution is to make the steel softer, more malleable.
[04:46:00.580 --> 04:46:02.480]   That will prevent breakage of the blade
[04:46:02.480 --> 04:46:04.980]   and chipping of the edge.
[04:46:04.980 --> 04:46:09.120]   But when you make the steel softer, that comes at a price.
[04:46:09.120 --> 04:46:11.360]   And that price is now the edge loses
[04:46:11.360 --> 04:46:16.040]   its sharpness very easily.
[04:46:16.040 --> 04:46:21.040]   And so the riddle of steel is how to work with these two
[04:46:21.040 --> 04:46:25.240]   to the greatest degree possible and create an edge
[04:46:25.240 --> 04:46:28.920]   which is hard enough to stay sharp for long periods of time,
[04:46:28.920 --> 04:46:31.760]   but without making the steel so brittle
[04:46:31.760 --> 04:46:34.800]   that the blade overall is compromised.
[04:46:34.800 --> 04:46:36.200]   So too in jiu-jitsu.
[04:46:36.200 --> 04:46:40.960]   Your task in training is to make the training
[04:46:40.960 --> 04:46:43.640]   competitive enough that you actually get used
[04:46:43.640 --> 04:46:46.280]   to the rigors of real combat.
[04:46:46.280 --> 04:46:48.980]   But on the other hand, it can't be so brutal
[04:46:48.980 --> 04:46:51.840]   that the athletes get broken down in the gym
[04:46:51.840 --> 04:46:54.240]   to a point where they're no longer effective.
[04:46:54.240 --> 04:46:58.820]   And so this duality of hardness and softness,
[04:46:58.820 --> 04:47:02.360]   which we see in the case of blades,
[04:47:02.360 --> 04:47:05.680]   is there in the training of the jiu-jitsu athlete.
[04:47:05.680 --> 04:47:09.400]   So I often give a gift of a knife to a student
[04:47:09.400 --> 04:47:11.360]   when they've done something significant
[04:47:11.360 --> 04:47:13.720]   because it demonstrates in a metaphorical way
[04:47:13.720 --> 04:47:16.300]   these key themes of the sport.
[04:47:16.300 --> 04:47:20.800]   - Well, I've been honored to be a student of yours.
[04:47:20.800 --> 04:47:22.580]   I've been plagued by injury,
[04:47:22.580 --> 04:47:27.320]   but I hope to one day earn one such knife.
[04:47:27.320 --> 04:47:30.240]   And I think that's a really powerful metaphor.
[04:47:30.240 --> 04:47:33.960]   I'm really honored that you would spend any time with me
[04:47:33.960 --> 04:47:37.240]   in any context, but especially on the mat
[04:47:37.240 --> 04:47:39.440]   and especially today in conversation, John,
[04:47:39.440 --> 04:47:40.520]   you're an incredible person.
[04:47:40.520 --> 04:47:41.800]   Thank you for everything you do.
[04:47:41.800 --> 04:47:45.800]   Congratulations for historic accomplishment.
[04:47:45.800 --> 04:47:48.520]   It's always beautiful and inspiring to see greatness.
[04:47:48.520 --> 04:47:53.520]   And what I saw, what we saw at ADCC was greatness,
[04:47:53.520 --> 04:47:54.880]   rare greatness.
[04:47:54.880 --> 04:47:56.800]   And it's beautiful to see that humans can achieve
[04:47:56.800 --> 04:47:57.840]   that kind of thing.
[04:47:57.840 --> 04:48:00.740]   So thank you for making that happen.
[04:48:00.740 --> 04:48:02.440]   And thank you for talking today.
[04:48:02.440 --> 04:48:03.380]   - Thank you, Lex.
[04:48:03.380 --> 04:48:06.000]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[04:48:06.000 --> 04:48:07.360]   with John Donahuer.
[04:48:07.360 --> 04:48:08.840]   To support this podcast,

[04:48:12.120 --> 04:48:14.320]   And now let me leave you with some words
[04:48:14.320 --> 04:48:15.800]   from Miyamoto Musashi.
[04:48:15.800 --> 04:48:21.240]   "The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight.
[04:48:21.240 --> 04:48:25.120]   And the only reason a warrior fights is to win."
[04:48:26.040 --> 04:48:29.400]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[04:48:29.400 --> 04:48:31.980]   (upbeat music)
[04:48:31.980 --> 04:48:34.560]   (upbeat music)
