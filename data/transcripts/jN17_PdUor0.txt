[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.180]   Well, if I'm looking at the schedule right, this episode launches on the evening of Thanksgiving.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.560]   So if that's the case, happy Thanksgiving evening to you.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.380]   I hope your day was full of great fellowship and good food.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.480]   Now we can push through the tryptophan haze together and we can do it while talking about
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.440]   the solid meat of sound doctrine.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.440]   It's a question that comes to us from Derek.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.680]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for the podcast and for answering very hard Bible questions
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.120]   throughout the years.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.780]   Here's mine.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.640]   Is there an ideal mark of doctrinal maturity to reach in the Christian life that once a
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.480]   person has gotten settled on the basics of Christ's life and work, his death and resurrection
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.000]   and the future of his return, then moves on from these foundational doctrines, leaving
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.480]   them behind, so to speak, and not returning to them and rethinking them over and over
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.960]   throughout the years?
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.800]   In other words, how do you, Pastor John, interpret Hebrews chapter 6, verses 1 to 3?
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.840]   Well, it is certainly right that we not be constantly going back to the basics of our
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.560]   faith as if to dig up the roots to see if they're still alive.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.800]   That's a good way to kill a plant.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.720]   And you don't constantly disassemble the foundation of your house to see if it's firm.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.000]   That's a good way to bring the whole house down on your head.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.360]   So that's the first thing to say.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:38.380]   The second thing to say is, no, there is no ideal mark of doctrinal maturity in the Christian
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.380]   life.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.760]   The Bible does not speak in terms of an ideal level of doctrinal or moral or spiritual maturity
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.920]   having been reached.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.080]   It speaks of minimal standards needing to be attained, and then a lifelong constant
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.200]   pursuit of growth.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.080]   So Ephesians 4 describes a kind of minimum knowledge and maturity growing up so that
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.520]   the saints aren't blown around like leaves or like children being knocked off balance
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.480]   by every wind of doctrine that comes along.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.600]   And then 2 Peter 3:18 says, "Grow, grow in the knowledge and the grace of the Lord Jesus."
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.860]   So the Bible doesn't talk in terms of an ideal level to be attained.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.280]   It constantly presses us onward and upward into more and more discoveries of God's unsearchable
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.080]   riches.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:46.200]   But I want to suggest to Derek maybe a significantly different way of understanding Hebrews 6:1-3
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.640]   than I sense he has.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:59.160]   He's assuming that what the author tells us to leave behind is gospel basics.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.520]   I don't think that's what the writer is referring to in verse 2.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.000]   Let me read it and try to show Derek and everybody else what I mean.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:19.200]   "Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.120]   again a foundation of repentance from dead work."
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   "Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120]   again a foundation of repentance from dead work."
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.120]   "Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying

[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.120]   "Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying
