[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Okay, let's talk about how best to study and learn.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.560]   And, of course, people have different learning styles.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.960]   Some people prefer to learn by reading.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.620]   Some people prefer to study in a group.
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.520]   Some people prefer to highlight.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.080]   Some people call themselves auditory learners.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.840]   Other people consider themselves visual learners.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.460]   But guess what?
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.240]   When one looks at the research on preferred learning styles, pretty much all of that melts
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.300]   away.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.200]   It turns out that the best way to study and learn is defined not by the medium in which
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.760]   that material arrives, whether or not it's auditory or visual or combined, whether or
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.500]   not you review slides or a textbook, or you watch small videos.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.780]   It turns out that the best way to study and learn is to access components of your memory
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.460]   systems that offset forgetting.
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.860]   This is a theme I'm going to return to over and over again throughout today's episode.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.720]   Rather than think about studying to learn and retain information, I want you to think
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.160]   about studying to offset the natural process of forgetting that everybody experiences when
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.360]   they are exposed to new material of any kind, cognitive or motor learning, musical learning,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360]   math, et cetera.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.280]   Okay, so keep this in mind throughout today's episode.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.820]   The best way to learn is to think about offsetting the natural forgetting of new information.
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.080]   You're trying to inoculate against forgetting.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.680]   That is the way to remember things.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.300]   That is the way to gain mastery over them.
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.780]   And I'm going to teach you how to best do that using the data gleaned from the peer
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.340]   reviewed literature.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.320]   Now before I do that, I want to talk about what learning is.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.000]   I promise to make this fairly brief because I've covered learning and so-called neuroplasticity
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.240]   before on this podcast.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.600]   For those of you that have heard those discussions, this will serve as a refresher.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.000]   For those of you that have not heard those discussions, this will be thorough enough
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.120]   for you to be able to digest all the rest of today's information.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.280]   Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature of your nervous system, which of course includes
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.680]   your brain and your spinal cord, which is the ability for your nervous system to change
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.580]   in response to experience.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.360]   So any form of learning involves neuroplasticity.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.440]   Neuroplasticity we sometimes hear as neural plasticity, two words or neuroplasticity.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.400]   Those are the same thing, essentially.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.960]   The change that underlies neuroplasticity at the level of cells, which we call neurons
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.640]   or nerve cells, generally involves three different mechanisms.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.960]   One is the strengthening of certain connections, what we call synaptic connections.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.720]   Synapses are the location between neurons where they communicate with one another.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.360]   It's actually a gap between the neurons.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.780]   It is technically called the synaptic cleft.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.780]   It's a gap.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.840]   And within that gap, chemicals are passed across that gap that allow one neuron to activate
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.240]   other neurons or many neurons to activate many other neurons or to inhibit the activity
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.780]   of other neurons, okay?
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.340]   So one form of neuroplasticity is the strengthening of connections between neurons.
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.100]   Another form of neuroplasticity is the weakening of connections between neurons.
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.220]   And yet a third form of plasticity, which is often discussed in the media, but is very
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.520]   rare actually in the nervous system, especially the adult nervous system of humans, is neurogenesis
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.900]   or the addition of new neurons.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.300]   Let's just get this out of the way upfront because the addition of new neurons, again,
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.240]   grabs so much attention in media articles, but it's responsible for a near trivial amount
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.220]   of the sort of neuroplasticity that is important for today's discussion or frankly for most
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.580]   all discussions.
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.780]   It is true you have a specialized set of neurons in your olfactory bulb that are responsible
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.900]   for smell as well as a specialized set of neurons in the so-called dentate gyrus of
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.680]   your hippocampus, an area of the brain that's important for memory in which new neurons
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.240]   appear to be added throughout the lifespan.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.620]   But this is not the major mechanism by which learning and memory occurs in humans.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.260]   Rather, the major mechanism by which learning and memory occurs in humans is the strengthening
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.820]   of existing connections and the weakening of existing connections or the formation of
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.180]   new connections between already existing neurons, not new neurons, okay?
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.260]   Now the removal or weakening of connections between neurons being an important component
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.020]   of neuroplasticity is very important for sake of today's discussion.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.100]   I want to emphasize that when we hear about weakening of connections, we often think,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.300]   well, that means forgetting, or that means the brain is getting less good.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.380]   However, so much of the neuroplasticity that underlies, for instance, the acquisition of
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.820]   a new motor skill is actually the reflection of removal of connections.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.980]   So we don't want to project any kind of value onto a discussion about adding new connections,
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.140]   removing new connections.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.460]   Let's just leave it at this level mechanistically.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.860]   When you hear about neuroplasticity, just know that it could be the consequence of strengthening
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.220]   of connections as well as weakening of connections.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.420]   And that neither strengthening of connections in the nervous system nor weakening of connections
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.860]   can map directly to the formation or removal of say memories or information.
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.860]   Just know that these are the important mechanisms.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.700]   In fact, if you look at a baby that is, let's say, I don't know, nine months old, their
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.580]   motor skills are not terrific typically compared to the motor skills that that child will have
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.660]   when they are six or seven years old.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.820]   Just look at a kid trying to eat spaghetti or something of that sort, or eat anything
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.340]   when they're a small baby versus a toddler versus a young child versus an adolescent
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.340]   or teen.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.700]   You know, despite the poor table manners of some adolescents and teens and some adults
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.420]   for that matter, they are still exhibiting far more precise motor movements than they
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.100]   did as an infant, of course.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.820]   And believe it or not, the improvement in motor coordination that one observes in humans
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.220]   and other species for that matter from birth until the adolescence and teen years and adult
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.860]   years is largely the reflection of the removal.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.820]   That's right, the removal of neural connections as opposed to the formation of neural connections.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.900]   However, the neural connections that remain become much more robust, they become much
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.900]   more reliable.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.260]   Okay, so that's the mechanistic backdrop for everything that we're going to talk about
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.780]   today, which is how to study and learn.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.940]   And as I mentioned earlier in my introduction, most of learning and remembering new material
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.780]   is about offsetting the forgetting process that naturally occurs anytime we hear new
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.220]   information.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.620]   So in keeping with what will ultimately reveal itself to be the dominant theme of today's
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.500]   discussion right now, and for reasons that will become clear later, I want you to take
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.100]   a brief quiz.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.540]   Now the moment people hear quiz or test, typically it spikes their adrenaline, they start feeling
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.220]   stressed, but don't worry, you're going to keep your answers to yourself.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.540]   And you're doing this for a very specific purpose.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.060]   Here's my question, this is a two question quiz.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.860]   How many different ways mechanistically speaking does neuroplasticity occur?
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.820]   Is it one mechanism, two mechanisms, or three mechanisms?
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.660]   Or is it four or five?
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.980]   Okay, can you name in your head two of the three major changes that the nervous system
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.500]   can undergo, which are reflective of neuroplasticity?
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.880]   Okay, so the answer to question was, is that there are three different modes of neuroplasticity,
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.580]   as you recall, or as you may not have been able to recall.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.980]   And by the way, if you were not able to recall the three different modes of neuroplasticity
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.500]   or mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity, that is fine.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:01.740]   As you'll soon realize, recognizing the errors in your information retention is another critical
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:07.100]   and very useful way to retain more information, even if you got the answer wrong or you didn't
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   know.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.400]   In fact, especially if you got the answer wrong or you didn't know.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.300]   So the three ways are the strengthening of neural connections, second, the weakening
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.060]   of neural connections, and third, through neurogenesis, the addition of new neurons.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.540]   Why did I provide this quiz?
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.540]   Why did I test you?
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:30.100]   Well, as you'll soon learn, if you look across the total body of research on how best to
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.980]   study and learn, it involves doing exactly what we just did, which is to periodically
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.780]   stop and test yourself on the material that you learned.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.540]   Studying is not just a way of evaluating what knowledge you've acquired and which knowledge
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:51.540]   you have not managed to acquire, it also turns out to be the best tool for offsetting forgetting
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.540]   of any kind.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.900]   And I'll go into the data that supports that statement in a moment.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.500]   So yes, today we're going to get a little bit meta in the sense that we're going to
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.940]   be learning about optimal studying strategies and applying those as we go through this podcast.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.440]   And no, there will not be a test at the end, although you're welcome to give yourself a
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   test at the end.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.420]   I'm going to provide you with an excellent zero cost, very fast tool that you can use
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.880]   to evaluate your knowledge and your ability to study and learn better as a consequence
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.660]   of having listened to this podcast versus had you not listened to this podcast.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.100]   So if ever there was an incentive to listen to the end, there it is.
