[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   All right, one last question.
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.800]   This comes from Diamond Michael, a writer from Denver.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.280]   So question 13, 13 questions for 2023.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.120]   This is question 13.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.860]   Diamond Michael says,
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.880]   over the years I have had numerous situations
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   where I've tried to launch a freelance business idea
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.600]   with little or no capital.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.800]   At the point in which the resulting financial scarcity
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.740]   becomes too much to bear,
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.000]   I resort to a regular full-time or part-time job
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.460]   in order to yield a steady income.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.880]   The problem is it seems like the more well-paying my job,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.900]   the greater the expectation in terms of work hours
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.880]   and energy investment.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.160]   This in turn reduces my time and energy bandwidth
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.680]   to devote to the deep work
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.200]   tied to what I quote unquote want to be doing.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.280]   So I'm curious as to what your advice is
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.860]   in resolving this dilemma,
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.400]   where my energy and attention are directed
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.200]   in two different directions.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.980]   All right, so Diamond Michael,
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.400]   we have to get way more systematic
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.660]   about what you're doing here.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.560]   Two pieces of advice to offer.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.040]   First is gonna be the piece of advice
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.480]   we've been saying throughout this entire episode.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.980]   Lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.420]   You are throwing energetic darts at the wall here.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.940]   You're like, I don't like my job.
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.540]   Like, let me just quit and do the side hustle.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.700]   Oh, the side hustle's not working.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.540]   I need a job.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.580]   What's the highest paying job?
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.860]   I guess I'll take that job.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.480]   You're just bouncing back and forth.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.860]   Sort of instinctual grabs from one thing to another.
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.220]   Let's get more systematic.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.940]   Develop a clear vision
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.000]   of what you think a life well-lived looks like.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.360]   All the different aspects of your lifestyle,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.300]   the properties of your work,
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.700]   but the properties of where you live,
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.900]   your community,
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.260]   the different types of things you're involved in,
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.140]   all of the attributes of a lifestyle vision
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.780]   that really resonates.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780]   Get this really clear,
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.680]   and then figure out pragmatic paths to get there.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.580]   This will inform what you need out of your job.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.380]   Where you're gonna live,
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.200]   what your lifestyle's like,
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400]   how much that costs,
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.360]   what type of properties you get out of your work.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.100]   This will help inform what type of job you need.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.340]   That's where you might figure out,
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340]   wait a second, I can use my expertise
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.660]   to get a freelance position in the same industry.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.640]   Allows me to move here,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.020]   ski 50 days, 50 weeks a year,
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.900]   not 50 weeks a year,
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.300]   50 days a year, I don't know.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.040]   50 days a year.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.500]   And have flexibility.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.260]   Great, this is the right path forward to my lifestyle.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.700]   Or I need a whole other,
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.980]   I need to leave my industry altogether
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.100]   and start my own business.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.980]   This is what's gonna help you answer that question.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.100]   Because I think what's happening now
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500]   is you're just fetishizing the idea of a side hustle
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.940]   as being drastically different
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.820]   than what you don't like about your job.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.700]   And if it's drastically different than what you don't like,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.600]   then maybe you'll drastically like it.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.140]   That syllogism is flawed.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.300]   You need to be working backwards from a specific lifestyle,
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.820]   detailed in terms of properties of your life,
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.860]   attributes of your life,
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.420]   and then figure out a career strategy that matches that.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.420]   If it turns out after you do this calculus
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.980]   that starting your own business,
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.540]   or having a side hustle that allows you
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.100]   to really pull back on your current work,
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.600]   and it makes the ends meet.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.860]   Oh, I could be freelance twice a week.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.820]   That's not quite enough money,
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.940]   but if I had a side hustle generating $30,000 a year,
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.300]   now the numbers work fine.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.780]   If you need some sort of side hustle or full-time business
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.380]   to make this vision work,
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.260]   then we're gonna get to my second piece of advice,
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.140]   which comes from my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.900]   which is the notion of using money
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.520]   as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.340]   You don't quit your job
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.220]   until the new thing is making enough money
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.500]   that you don't have to worry about money
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.620]   when you quit your job.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.660]   Now, it could still grow more
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.780]   when you give it more attention,
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.740]   but it has to prove itself.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.300]   Your side hustle or business idea
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.140]   has to prove itself by generating money.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.060]   People will always tell you,
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.500]   "What a great idea, Diamond Michael.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.540]   "Great, do it.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.780]   "Follow your passion.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.260]   "You be you."
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.300]   It's easy to give compliments.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.620]   What's hard is to get people to give you money.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.460]   They will not give you money
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.100]   unless they actually like what you're offering.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.420]   So use money as your neutral indicator of value.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.380]   When your business or side hustle idea
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.460]   is generating sufficient money to support you,
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.460]   then you make the change in your other job.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.620]   And if it's not, that means it's not a good business.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.780]   It's not a successful side hustle.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.780]   Don't flee that feedback.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.020]   That's the most realistic feedback
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.860]   you're gonna get on the viability of your option.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.700]   All right, so those are my two pieces of advice.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.340]   Do lifestyle-centered career planning
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.900]   instead of action-based career planning.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.980]   Quitting will be exciting.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.420]   Disruption will be exciting.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.980]   My own job is better than one where I work.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.900]   That's action-based career planning.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.620]   That's just giving into your gut
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.620]   and fleeting emotions in the moment.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.780]   Be more systematic.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.980]   And if that plan does point towards the need
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.460]   for you doing something on the side or something on your own,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.340]   let money be your neutral indicator of value.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.780]   If people aren't paying you for it, it's not a good idea,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.300]   no matter how much you think it is your dream.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.180]   (upbeat music)
