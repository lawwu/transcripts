[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Do all of our sins hinder our prayers?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Today we address a really great listener email. Here it is. Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Thank you for this podcast. My name is Ryan. The Bible
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   says dishonoring a wife will hinder a husband's
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   prayers. We see this in 1 Peter 3, verse 7. Is this a
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   particular dynamic for marriage only, or is this part of a
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   larger principle of sin? Do all of our sins
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   hinder the effectiveness of our prayers?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   The answer to the first question is no. Namely, is this
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   a particular dynamic for marriage only?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   No. And we'll see why in just a minute. The answer
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   to the second question is not necessarily.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Do all our sins hinder
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   the effectiveness of our prayers? Not necessarily.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   First, because God in His mercy
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   may show a special grace
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   by answering a prayer in spite of some of our sins,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   while at other times, He may show a
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   disciplinary grace by withholding an answer to prayer.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   If God correlated the answers to our prayers
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   precisely to our sins, we wouldn't get any
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   answers to prayer. So we should never
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   think that an answer to prayer signifies
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   sinlessness. But we should not
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   conclude from this that there's no correlation
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   between our sinning and our
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   answers to prayer. So Ryan's first question is
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   whether the principle of 1 Peter 3:7 applies
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   only in marriage or more broadly. Now here's what the
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   verse says. Husbands, live with
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   your wives in an understanding way, showing
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   prayers may not be hindered.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Now there are at least three possible meanings
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   for the way prayers are hindered in this verse.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   First, it might be that the prayers that
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   are being hindered are the prayers of the husband and the wife
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   that they're supposed to pray together and that the
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   failure of the husband to care for and respect his wife undermines that
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   fellowship that they should have together so that they can't feel any
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   harmony when they're together and so the prayers that they ought to be praying
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   together don't happen. They don't pray together anymore because
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   something's come between them because he's not doing what he's supposed to do
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   in this verse. That's the first possible meaning. Here's the second one.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It would be that the husband's prayers are hindered in
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   that his heart is so selfish toward his
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   wife that his actual praying
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   not just the answers, but his praying is hindered.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   The praying itself doesn't come out of his heart anymore.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   In other words, he just stops praying. His heart is so wrong
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   toward his wife, it doesn't want to approach God anymore
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   in any kind of humble, needy way. He's just not praying anymore.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And the third meaning would be that the man
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   is praying, but that God is withholding
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   answers to his prayers because his
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   heart is not right toward his wife. Now I think in
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   reality, all three of those are true.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   All those explanations of 1 Peter 3:7 are
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   true in reality. In other words, if a husband fails to be
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   kind and gentle and cherishing toward
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   his wife as the weaker vessel, and if he fails to
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   be respectful and esteeming and admiring of her
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   as a fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   all three of these hindrances are going to happen.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   One, the relationship is going to be undermined, and therefore
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   the partnership in prayer will be threatened. Two,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   his own heart will begin to grow cold, and his own
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   prayer life will dry up. And three, the answers
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   to his prayers may be withheld because he's not showing mercy
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   to his wife. Now, here's why
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I think all three of those are in fact
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   reality. Going beyond 1 Peter now to show why they
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   are true in reality. When Jesus says in Matthew
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   18, 19, that if two or three
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   on earth agree about anything
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   and they ask me, it will be done for them by my
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Father in heaven, he's pointing to a principle.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   A breakdown in horizontal fellowship
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   where two or three can't agree anymore will result in a breakdown
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   of vertical blessing from God. So if a husband and a wife
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   become so spiritually distant from each other,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Matthew 18, 19 implies they won't have
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   the harmony together that calls down God's blessing. That's number one.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Number two, when John writes in 1 John 4,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   20, that he who does not love
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   his brother whom he has seen cannot love
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   God whom he has not seen, John is implying
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   that failures of love at the horizontal
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   level signal a breakdown of
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   love toward God at the vertical level. In other words,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the failure to love our wives, or other Christians for that
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   matter, signals that we are losing
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   our ability to go to God in love. We are not
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   able to pray because we don't really love
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   God. But I'm inclined to think that it's the
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   third possible meaning of 1 Peter 3, 7 that Peter
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   mainly has in mind, namely that if
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   we go on sinning against our wives or against
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   other Christians, we are shutting the door
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   on the flow of grace toward us in answered
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   prayer. James says, for example, in James 4, 3,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "You ask and do not receive
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions."
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   In other words, God sometimes withholds
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   answers to prayer because we have sinful aims
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   in our heart. Our prayer is not for the
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   healing of a broken relationship. Our prayer is for some worldly
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   advantage. Jesus put it most starkly
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   in the Lord's Prayer when he said, "Forgive us our debts as
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   we have forgiven our debtors," Matthew 6, 12.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   In other words, if you hold a grudge against your
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   wife or treat other people unmercifully
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and then cry out to God for mercy, you're simply
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   making a mockery out of God, and God will not be mocked.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   be shown mercy," Matthew 5, 7. But the
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   main reason I think this is probably
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   what Peter has in mind when he speaks to husbands
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   and says that their prayers are going to be hindered if they don't cherish
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   their wives as they should, the main reason is because in the
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   next paragraph, the very next verse, he begins
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   by explaining the same principle is in play
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   with regard to all Christians in all our relationships.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Here's what he says, "Finally, all of you." So right after saying
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that the husbands aren't going to get answers to prayer if they are disrespectful to their
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   wives, he says, "Finally, all of you have unity
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, tender heart, a humble mind.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Don't repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   contrary, bless, for to this you were called that you may obtain a blessing."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And then he starts to argue for that. He argues
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   by quoting Psalm 34, 12 to 16, and listen to
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   how the Psalm argues for how to get answered prayer.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   "For whoever desires to love life
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   lips from speaking deceit. Let him turn away from evil and do good. Let him
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   seek peace and pursue it because
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   and his ears are open to their prayer.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   But the face of the Lord is
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   against those who do evil." So
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   husbands and all of us have just
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   heard in verse 7 that the husbands' prayers are going to be
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   hindered if they don't treat their wives with care
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   and respect. And now, five verses later,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Peter tells all of us the eyes
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The righteous, he's open to the righteous in their prayer,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. That's probably
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   the same principle from marriage
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   applied to all of us. So my conclusion, Ryan, is that
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   the word to husbands is a word to
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   everybody in principle. If in the
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   relationships that God has given us, whether marriage or parenting
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   or friendship or neighborliness or collegiality, if in
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   any of those relationships we begin to act
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   unlovingly, disrespectfully, unmercifully,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   unkindly, we may expect that God
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   will, in mercy, withhold
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   blessings when we pray.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   This will be a loving discipline for his children,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   and we should take it to heart and repent
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and walk worthily of his calling.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Wonderful. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Ryan.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   If you have a question for us, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   That's our homepage, and there you will see a button that says "Submit a Question,"
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   and that will open up an email to us. Keep the great questions coming in, we really appreciate it.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Well, we return on Wednesday to look at suffering, namely
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   what can give us patience in the long, dragged-out,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   often unexpected trials of life amidst the circumstances, the detours,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   the delays that from our limited viewpoint make no
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   sense to us. When our suffering drags on and it makes
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   no sense to us, where can we find patience to endure?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   So important. It's critical, and it's up next time on
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Wednesday. I'm your host Tony Reinke, and Pastor John and I will see you then.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Thanks for listening.
