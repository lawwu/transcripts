[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.120]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.440]   My guest today is Dr. Natalie Crawford.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.560]   Dr. Natalie Crawford is a medical doctor
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.280]   specializing in obstetrics and gynecology,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.920]   reproductive endocrinology, and infertility.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.800]   She also holds a degree in nutrition science.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.720]   Dr. Crawford runs a clinical practice
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.240]   seeing patients daily,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.120]   as well as being actively involved in public education,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.480]   both through social media
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.720]   and through her popular podcast entitled "As a Woman."
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.360]   Today, Dr. Crawford teaches us about all aspects
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.760]   of female hormones and hormone health and fertility,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.140]   beginning as far back as in utero,
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.280]   when we were still in our mother's womb,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.060]   and extending as far forward as menopause.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.360]   We discuss topics such as the timing of puberty
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.760]   and what the timing of puberty in girls means
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.100]   for their fertility, and we discuss birth control,
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880]   both hormonal and non-hormonal forms of birth control,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.660]   and how birth control may or may not
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420]   relate to long-term fertility
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.500]   and different aspects of female health.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.400]   We also talk extensively about measuring fertility,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.720]   that is egg count.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.360]   We also talk about egg retrieval,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.080]   AKA freezing one's eggs, as well as in vitro fertilization.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.000]   And we also take a deep dive into the popular
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.960]   and important topics of nutrition and supplementation
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.440]   as they relate to fertility, as they relate to pregnancy,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.960]   but also how they relate to female hormone health generally.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.400]   Indeed, Dr. Crawford provides us with a masterclass
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.680]   on female hormones and fertility,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.200]   one that I know that all women ought to benefit from
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   and that men would benefit from listening to as well.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.840]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.940]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.480]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.180]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.280]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.140]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.580]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.840]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.760]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.500]   I've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.780]   and with guests about the need to get approximately
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.300]   one gram of high quality protein per pound of body weight
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.840]   each day for optimal nutrition.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.080]   There are many different ways that one can do that,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.740]   but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.020]   by ingesting excessive calories.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.240]   Maui Nui Venison has the highest density
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.380]   of quality protein per calorie,
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.960]   and it achieves that in delicious things like ground meats,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.240]   venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.100]   I particularly like the ground venison.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.400]   I make those into venison burgers
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.560]   probably five times a week or more.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.940]   I also like the jerky for its convenience,
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.040]   especially when I'm traveling
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.840]   or I'm especially busy with work
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.420]   and know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient-dense
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.020]   high quality source of protein.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.160]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.540]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.800]   and get 20% off your first order.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.740]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.740]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.780]   that are tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.820]   Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.560]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.500]   When we are sleeping well and enough,
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   mental health, physical health, and performance
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.060]   all stand to be at their best.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.900]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.520]   is to make sure that your mattress
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.740]   is tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.820]   Helix Sleep has a brief two-minute quiz
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.360]   that if you go to their website,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.180]   you take that quiz and answer questions
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.820]   such as do you tend to sleep on your back,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.700]   your side, or your stomach?
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.180]   Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.020]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.220]   and that's fine.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.700]   At the end of that two-minute quiz,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.180]   they will match you to a mattress
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.140]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.700]   I sleep on the Dusk, a D-U-S-K mattress,
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.660]   and when I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.380]   about two years ago, my sleep immediately improved.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.220]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.640]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.900]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.140]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.240]   and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.760]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.040]   Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.100]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.020]   I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.380]   four live events in Australia,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.220]   each of which is entitled The Brain Body Contract,
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.100]   during which I will share science and science-related tools
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.800]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.780]   There will also be a live question and answer session.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.420]   We have limited tickets still available
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.100]   for the event in Melbourne on February 10th,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.580]   as well as the event in Brisbane on February 24th.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.740]   Our event in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.460]   sold out very quickly, so as a consequence,
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.960]   we've now scheduled a second event in Sydney
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.980]   at the Aware Super Theater on February 18th.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.180]   To access tickets to any of these events,
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.540]   you can go to hubermanlab.com/events
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.900]   and use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.080]   I hope to see you there, and as always,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.260]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Natalie Crawford.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.620]   Dr. Crawford, welcome.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.340]   - Thank you so much for having me, I'm honored to be here.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.620]   - Well, I've been paying attention to your content
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.140]   for a long time, and I find it to be incredibly clear,
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.940]   informative, and for many people, actionable.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.040]   So today, I'd like to talk about both fertility
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.940]   and of course, hormones.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.940]   But as we both know, fertility is not limited
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.340]   to a discussion about hormones.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.420]   It actually relates to things like behaviors, sex behaviors,
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.560]   and other behaviors, nutrition, supplementation.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.820]   So we'll get into all of it,
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.500]   but if we could just back up developmentally
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.360]   and talk a little bit about female puberty,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.180]   because I think pretty much everything
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.460]   we'll talk about today is related
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.680]   to what happens puberty forward, mostly in females,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.860]   but we will also discuss male fertility and hormones a bit.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.360]   And the question I have is,
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.380]   is there anything about a woman's timing
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.700]   or let's just say patterns of puberty, right?
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.460]   How frequently they menstruate early on,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.860]   what the timing of menstruation is
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.580]   in terms of their age, et cetera,
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.580]   that provides hints or maybe even facts or directives
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.920]   about her future fertility
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.080]   or how long her fertility might last?
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.020]   - This is a great question
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.860]   and I think defining some terminology
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.400]   before we begin is helpful.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.900]   So if we go all the way back
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.760]   to when you're a fetus inside your mom,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   so when there's a female fetus inside your mom,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.540]   you have the most eggs you're ever going to have
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.340]   at about 20 weeks gestation.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.700]   You have about six to seven million eggs.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.300]   By the time you're born,
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.500]   you've already lost more than half of those
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.960]   and you continually lose eggs all the time.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.180]   So the analogy that I always use and you do too,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.540]   is imagining that there's a vault inside the ovary
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.060]   where all your eggs are kept
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.800]   and every single month since the moment you have an ovary,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.740]   you lose a group of these eggs
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.500]   and when there's more inside, you're losing more.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.740]   So you're losing all of these eggs
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.540]   throughout early fetal development
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.800]   and then up until the time period even of puberty.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.100]   When you reach puberty,
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.820]   you have a lessening of the number of eggs in your ovary
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.300]   to the point where it can start to respond
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.060]   to the signals from the brain.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.380]   So we think about puberty onset in females.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.820]   First, we have really thelarchy,
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.720]   which is the development of breasts.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.060]   So that happens about two years on average
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.820]   before you have menarche, which is your period starting.
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.980]   So what happens is the brain,
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.180]   as we know from the hypothalamus sends out GnRH
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.220]   and then we have FSH coming out,
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.760]   which really starts to stimulate those follicles.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.220]   So FSH or follicle stimulating hormone,
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.380]   well-named hormone for the female.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.460]   Of course, men have it too
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.260]   and it's less well named for them,
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.060]   but it starts to get those follicles,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.140]   which house the eggs to grow and make estrogen.
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.580]   Women have about two years of estrogen exposure alone,
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.220]   so unopposed estrogen with no progesterone
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.060]   because they're not yet ovulating.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.180]   And that's when you start to see breast budding
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.700]   and you start to see the development
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.300]   of some of those secondary sex characteristics
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.140]   before you actually have a period.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.560]   - What are some of the other secondary sex characteristics
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.540]   that precede menarche?
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.460]   So you said breast bud development and then breast development
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.280]   on average about two years before menarche.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.500]   - About two years before you have sexual hair development.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.020]   So actually adrenarche is one of the first,
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.480]   usually comes right before at the same time with breast buds.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.420]   So two to three years before you'll see your period.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.860]   - So genital hair, underarm hair, typically.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.620]   - Exactly, yeah, genital hair usually first
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.020]   and then underarm hair.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.700]   - And we're getting right down into the weeds here,
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.540]   which is good.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.740]   A goal of this podcast is to normalize
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.140]   all aspects of health, including sexual health
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.260]   and reproductive health.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.260]   Is that commensurate also with the development of body odor?
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.300]   'Cause as a young boy who eventually hit puberty
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.440]   and became a young man,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.720]   and now I suppose I'm in middle age, I'm 48,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.860]   I can tell you that the locker room smelled a lot different
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.460]   before and after middle school, right?
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.460]   Like in other words, boys start to smell stinky, right?
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.300]   - They do, yes.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.620]   And that's usually around that same time
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.220]   of sexual hair development
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.980]   is when you start to have those glands around the hair
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.820]   making some of those odors that start to produce stink.
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.020]   - Do they reflect hormones themselves?
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.500]   - Not this, like the smell, the actual smell
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.660]   doesn't actually reflect levels of hormones
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.680]   or anything like that.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.340]   It is just that your body, your gonads,
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.020]   whether it is testes or ovaries
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.880]   are now starting to respond to those brain signals.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.680]   The brain is turned on, they're starting to respond
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.020]   and your body is starting to mature in a way
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.680]   to get to the point where it can support reproduction.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.000]   - The reason I asked that question
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.380]   is not to get people thinking about stinky smells,
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.200]   but, and by the way, some people love the musty smell
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.060]   of their own armpits or others, you know,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.940]   we're referring to adults, by the way.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.740]   But the reason I ask is that there's a wealth of data
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.880]   in animal models, including non-human primates,
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.460]   suggesting that exposure to the odors of others
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.060]   can either stimulate or accelerate puberty.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.300]   Is there any evidence for that in humans?
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.460]   - So there's mild evidence and it's murky
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.620]   because we also know that anything
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.260]   that could be an endocrine disruptor,
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.500]   which a lot of scents or fragrances are also,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.500]   can accelerate the onset of puberty
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.460]   by disrupting part of this system.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.900]   And so we know that toxins and scents
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.620]   and a lot of the world that we're exposed to
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.620]   is part of the reason why we're seeing puberty happen
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.260]   at such a younger age now in females specifically,
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.460]   but in both, but in females than we have before.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.460]   We have young girls seeing their onset of menarche
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.900]   or their period at a much younger age.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.860]   - How much younger?
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.820]   I've seen the various graphs for different countries,
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.760]   but can we say that, you know, 10 years ago on average,
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.580]   girls in the United States and Northern Europe
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.940]   were getting menarche at about what, 12 to 13 years of age?
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.780]   - So, you know, we'll use menarche for the purpose of this.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.420]   So having your period, you know, 10 to 20 years ago,
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.180]   you will see most data would say, oh, 13 to 15
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.380]   would have been kind of the average age.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.700]   And now we're really seeing it shift
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.780]   to be starting at 10 to 11 and completing by 13, 14.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.540]   So most girls are definitely going through
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.220]   the puberty change earlier.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.740]   And the other thing to note is that
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.860]   most girls get their final height growth
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.460]   right before they start their period too.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.780]   So not only are we seeing a change
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.320]   in this getting, starting earlier,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.460]   what we're also seeing is probably some reduction in height
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.260]   from having gone through puberty at an earlier process,
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.780]   because once you start actually menstruating,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.060]   once the ovaries have really started to learn
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.120]   how to respond to that FSH and grow the follicle,
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.480]   and it gets to the point where you can start ovulating.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.100]   So about two years later, then that ovulatory period,
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.220]   those high levels of estrogen are going to go
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.380]   and they're going to close those growth plates.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.980]   So you've really started to limit your final adult height
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.380]   as well when you go through puberty earlier.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.300]   And that's definitely something that's a huge concern
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.780]   for precocious puberty or very young puberty, right?
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.560]   And we can use blockers when there are children
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.820]   who start to exhibit signs of puberty.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.120]   And one of the main reasons people do that
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.260]   is to try to get them to a greater adult height
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.000]   if they're really starting to go through puberty
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.140]   at a very young age.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.220]   - Is that also true for males?
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.420]   - That it's happening earlier?
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.540]   - Yeah, the earlier puberty means that your growth spurt
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.360]   in terms of height is going to be truncated.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.780]   - Not the same.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.060]   And you probably, most men will say,
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.420]   "Oh, but I had my growth spurt
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.460]   after I started having some of the puberty change
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.720]   that happened."
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.460]   But because it is this estrogen-related process in women
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.900]   that we see that growth spurt,
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.180]   really your final height is within that year
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.500]   of when your period starts.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   - Interesting, yeah, this discussion
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.540]   is certainly not about me, but I was one of these,
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.820]   what I thought was kind of an odd duck.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.020]   I hit puberty about 13, 14.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.220]   Let's just say I knew I did,
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.120]   but I didn't shave until I was after college.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.260]   My growth spurt between freshman and sophomore year,
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.780]   I grew a foot, right?
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.700]   So I was like, you know, I grew a full foot,
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.820]   but I was the same weight.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.340]   So I was like real tall, real skinny,
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.020]   or pre-tall, you know, real skinny.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.340]   And then it seems like, you know,
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.420]   some people in my life would argue
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.900]   that puberty is still occurring for me,
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.700]   but it feels like it's very long and protracted,
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.920]   which leads me to a very specific question.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.100]   If puberty arrives, let's, again, defined as menarche
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.260]   for sake of our discussion right now,
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.080]   if puberty arrives early in a girl,
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.740]   does that mean that her fertility
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.620]   will shut down earlier as well?
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.080]   - Great question, it does not.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.220]   So the age of which you start the onset of your period
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.860]   does not impact how long you're going
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.660]   to have a reproductive lifespan.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.260]   And that's because you have the eggs inside that vault.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.500]   You're losing them every month, no matter what.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.420]   So you lost them all those years before your period started,
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.580]   no matter if your period came at 10 or at 15.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.780]   It's just about when did they start allowing your body
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.820]   to ovulate, determined by being able to carry a baby.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.280]   Your body now thinks you can be pregnant.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.040]   - I think this is so important to highlight
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.620]   because it puts together what you said earlier
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380]   about the loss of eggs, even as a fetus.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.300]   I think most people sort of assume
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.660]   that the reduction in egg count is due to ovulation
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.180]   and the fact that, you know, one egg ovulates typically,
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.580]   but that other eggs are deployed in that ovulatory cycle.
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.100]   And then those basically are taken out of the vault
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.340]   and out of the opportunity for fertilization.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.860]   But what you're saying is that the eggs
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.980]   are constantly being culled from the vault,
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.460]   starting from early embryonic development,
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.300]   and that ovulation is a distinct step,
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.020]   in some sense unrelated to the loss of eggs.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.340]   I think this is going to be very important
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.180]   for our discussion later about potential egg harvest,
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.020]   because I think some people have it in mind.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.340]   - A lot of misconceptions that you're losing eggs
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.280]   from your vault, and that's not the case.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.300]   You're just accessing the ones outside.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.580]   - Gosh, so you're not,
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.620]   so we can just answer this now, perhaps.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.260]   It seems, if I understand correctly,
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.940]   that if one were to harvest eggs for IVF
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.780]   or for embryogenesis in a dish to set them aside later
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.900]   or freeze them for later, if they want to use them,
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.060]   eggs or fertilized embryos,
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.060]   that one is not reducing their total number of eggs
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.060]   any more than they would
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.540]   had they just let their cycles proceed naturally.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.380]   - Exactly.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.540]   - That's such an important point.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.140]   I think a lot of people believe the opposite.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.900]   - It's probably the number one thing that patients fear
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.920]   when they come talk to me about egg freezing
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.620]   or going through IVF is,
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.400]   I don't want to harm my future fertility.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.140]   I don't want to cause myself to run out of eggs earlier
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.100]   or going to menopause earlier.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.940]   And it's explaining this process to them
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.940]   that your ovaries are on a pathway that you can't change.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.640]   Those eggs are coming out of the vault,
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.880]   regardless of if you're on birth control pills,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.660]   you're pregnant, we do IVF.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.500]   What we're modifying is one's not going to ovulate
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.800]   and have the rest of them die.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.560]   We're going to try to give you medication
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.700]   to get them all to grow so we can take all of the ones
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.340]   that have been released from the vault that month
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.060]   and give them a chance for later.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.340]   And the next month you'll have another group come out.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.980]   - So IVF is not about stimulating hyper release
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.220]   or excessive release of eggs.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.520]   It's about stimulating the growth of the ones
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.800]   that have been released so that they can be frozen
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.960]   at stage either for later fertilization or fertilized
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   in addition than frozen as embryos, is that right?
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.800]   - Exactly.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.960]   And we just use the hormones that your body normally makes
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.660]   in a different way.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.400]   The medications we use are FSH and LH
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.340]   to get the eggs to grow.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.800]   So people will say,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.740]   I don't want to take all these weird hormones
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.440]   or strange medications,
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.440]   but we're just manipulating that normal process
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.600]   that happens in the natural menstrual cycle
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.440]   in order to say, hey, this month,
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.760]   let's get all these eggs to grow.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.200]   Let's try to improve the efficiency
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.680]   of finding which eggs are going to be normal or not
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.600]   and help you along this process.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.720]   - I think a good number of people
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.200]   are now going to head to the IVF clinic.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.320]   I think, again, I really want to highlight this.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.460]   I think most people that I've spoken to assume
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.120]   that the process of harvesting eggs for freezing,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.960]   for fertilization then or later
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.580]   is going to diminish their fertility
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.460]   because they're basically pulling
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.320]   more out of the savings account, so to speak.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.160]   - Right. - Okay.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.900]   - You're making the withdrawal no matter what.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.860]   - Great, well, such an important point
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.820]   for people to know and propagate.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.180]   Getting back to puberty,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.380]   a little bit later on,
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.540]   I wanted to get into endocrine disruptors
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.380]   and things of that sort.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.500]   But since you brought it up,
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.860]   I've heard things such as, okay,
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.840]   things like evening primrose oil.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.460]   If mom is putting evening primrose oil on
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.960]   or has it in her shampoo,
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.580]   that I've heard of young males
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.760]   getting precocious breast bud development.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.880]   Keep in mind, folks,
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.480]   that some transient breast bud development
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.520]   is characteristic of some normal pubrities in males.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.700]   It sometimes shows up and goes.
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.820]   I knew some kids like that in the neighborhood.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.740]   They got teased a little bit
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.980]   and then they stopped getting teased.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.300]   Hopefully nowadays they don't tease those kids.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.340]   But when I was growing up, those kids got teased,
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.020]   not by me, but by other people.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.860]   But it was normal and it passed for some, right?
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.100]   It occurred normally and then passed.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.840]   But I've heard that things like
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.320]   exposure to evening primrose oil,
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.380]   maybe even just through contact with mom,
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.180]   can increase the frequency or degree
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.320]   of that male breast bud development.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.160]   Is it also true that young girls
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.900]   can undergo precocious puberty
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:36.100]   or let's just say accelerated or exacerbated puberty
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.620]   through contact with things like evening primrose oil,
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.740]   which I think has some pseudo estrogen-like properties?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.420]   - It's important to differentiate
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.660]   that the secondary sex characteristics we see,
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.720]   like breast bud development, are from estrogen,
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.440]   but it's not really puberty being initiated
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.600]   when it's from an endocrine disrupting chemical.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.100]   So being exposed to evening primrose
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.160]   or lavender or tea tree oil in a male
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.100]   isn't going to cause him to start to go into puberty,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.920]   but it is going to expose him to estrogen
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.440]   when his body is not,
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.220]   and therefore stimulate some breast bud development.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.700]   Same thing can happen in young girls,
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.180]   meaning they could show some of those secondary sex signs
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.180]   earlier than they normally would.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.740]   And this is why if that's happening at a really young age,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.760]   kids should go to a pediatric endocrinologist
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.540]   who are gonna check things like bone age
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.780]   and see if you've really started the puberty process or not,
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.360]   or is it an outside exposure which is causing it?
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.140]   Interestingly, about the young child exposure
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.300]   and development, the other thing to say
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.840]   that's really interesting and relevant in my field
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.380]   is that when we think about how many eggs are in the vault,
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.260]   and everybody's born with this different number,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.760]   and I'm sure we'll talk about ovarian reserve,
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.500]   what we now know is that the vault,
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.900]   your ovaries are most susceptible
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.500]   to whatever your mother does when she's pregnant with you.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.580]   And that that epigenetic, that programming which is happening
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.340]   is predisposing young women to probably having,
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.820]   some of them low ovarian reserve,
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.740]   some of them having diseases we associate with infertility
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.980]   like PCOS or endometriosis.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.860]   And we haven't yet characterized what all they are,
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.520]   but if we look at the incidence of some of these disease
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.880]   that we see now, what we do know is that the time period
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.300]   of which these people were pregnant, the '80s and '90s,
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.540]   was not the healthiest time
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.020]   when it comes to endocrine disruptors and plastic exposures
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.380]   and chemicals and all of this processed stuff.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.940]   Let's just say that people have been exposed to,
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.820]   that we're really seeing that those,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.820]   that ovarian susceptibility to egg quality and quantity
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.540]   happens in that fetal development period.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.040]   - It's interesting because there's some parallels
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.020]   to male fetal development,
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.300]   like the fact that you have these early organizing effects
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.060]   of hormones like dihydrotestosterone,
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.340]   which essentially stimulate the growth of the penis,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.380]   but also then establish a propensity
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.620]   for hormones during puberty to activate growth
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.940]   of the sex organs, but also activate the brain areas
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.540]   that are responsible for a host of different things.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.300]   So I only mentioned that because what I'd like
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.980]   to kind of illustrate in the background here
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.980]   is that basically our reproductive health
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.580]   begins really prior to conception, really.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.420]   It's dependent on mom and dad,
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.740]   but certainly to a great degree on mom,
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.740]   but then fetal development is going to be important.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.400]   So sort of us being able to pick our parents.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.480]   I do have a couple of questions about lavender tea tree oil
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.900]   and evening primrose oil.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.140]   I was aware that evening primrose oil, excuse me,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.980]   can somehow bind estrogen receptors
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.180]   or mimic some of the estradiol or something similar to it.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.640]   I wasn't aware of tea tree oil or lavender.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.700]   Here, are we talking about oils?
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.340]   What about aromas?
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.920]   And how concerned do people have to be about this stuff?
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.800]   Because I mean, you'll go into a restaurant bathroom,
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.860]   there'll be potpourri, some people wear perfume.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.920]   I mean, we don't want to set a paranoia.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.760]   - No, no.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.600]   - But I think people should know about this stuff.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.260]   Tea tree oil is in a lot of those natural shampoos.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.420]   - A lot of the shampoos. - The ones that burn.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.900]   - Yes, the one that tingle your scalp.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.740]   - Yeah, I don't like those.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.060]   - Some people love them though.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.180]   Constant exposure is very different
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.320]   than a one-time hand washing in the bathroom.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.940]   And I think that's the big difference for everything
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.480]   when we talk about chemicals or toxins
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.620]   or exposures in the world.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.180]   You can't live in a toxin-free world.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.460]   But choosing what you put in and on your body
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.040]   on a regular basis does set the tone
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.180]   for certain physiologic changes.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.180]   And so using unscented products, especially with children,
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.540]   is really an important thing
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.500]   because we want to make sure that their lifetime exposure
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.340]   to some of these things, especially during critical times,
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.320]   is much less.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.100]   And so you'll see people recommend things
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.700]   like your laundry detergent.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.020]   You know, what's sensor in your laundry detergent?
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.900]   The shampoo and conditioner are a big one.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.500]   And the soaps that you use on a day-to-day basis
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.200]   in your house or the oils you put on your body.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.340]   Lavender's huge because there's this whole community
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.500]   of people, they want to rub lavender oil
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.180]   on their baby's feet and help them sleep.
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.960]   But really we can see, and if somebody goes
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.900]   and shadows a pediatric endocrinologist for a day,
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.560]   they'll see some kids come in
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.300]   and this will be the reason why.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.980]   - What about cloth diapers versus non-cloth diapers?
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.320]   I've heard, you know, that you have
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.060]   your very strong cloth diaper proponents, right?
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.860]   And that because they seem to feel or believe
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.400]   that non-cloth diapers somehow contain things
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.780]   that can get into baby's skin.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.220]   And maybe there's a bigger question here.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.300]   Is baby's skin more permeable than adult skin?
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.920]   - Because they don't know that baby's skin
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.760]   is more permeable or not.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.960]   - I don't either.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.460]   To me, it seems like it'd be hard to imagine it is,
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.020]   but babies do seem to have this incredible skin, right?
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.780]   Their skin is so smoozy and you want to squeeze their cheeks
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.820]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.160]   But yeah, the idea that it would be more permeable.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.340]   - I think it's more that their development is,
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.060]   this time is very important and setting the stage
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.900]   for a lot of what happens later.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.880]   Versus in adulthood, those stepwise developmental processes
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.720]   have already happened.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.220]   So I think that's why we pay so much attention
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.460]   to what happens in the childhood period of time,
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.420]   because we're now learning about those later consequences
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.300]   of what you're exposed to.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.380]   It's not that regular diapers versus cloth,
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.380]   whatever we want to say,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.660]   one's necessarily better than the other.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.980]   It's more honestly a personal preference.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.600]   Babies are exposed to them a lot,
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.900]   and there's been a lot of attention to that.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.780]   But similarly, somebody could use cloth
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.300]   and wash it with a detergent
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.940]   that then has certain chemicals in it.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.620]   So there hasn't been a study shown that this one thing
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.000]   is an exposure for a baby
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.500]   that somebody needs to be worried about.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:01.300]   There's definitely companies now which are promoting
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.640]   and talking about traditional diapers
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.400]   that they are making sure have less toxins in them.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.220]   And I always think anytime you can decrease toxin exposure
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.480]   to a child is going to be very important.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.900]   - Is there any evidence for breast milk versus formula
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.900]   in terms of impact on future reproductive development
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.620]   or reproductive status of a child?
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.100]   - That's a complicated question
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.500]   because breast milk exposure,
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.860]   at least for the first six months of a child's life,
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.460]   certainly helps with the immune system development.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.780]   And we know that poor immune development
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.940]   can lead to higher risk of autoimmune disease later,
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.420]   what people call leaky gut.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.780]   And some of those diseases
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.300]   certainly are correlated with fertility.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.680]   So I wouldn't say we've gone so far to say
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.220]   that if you don't breastfeed your child,
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.760]   they're going to have fertility issues,
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.300]   but we do know that there's an in-between correlation
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.340]   with things that breastfeeding is protective against
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.420]   and how those diseases themselves may relate to fertility
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.780]   in the female later on.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:09.100]   - Okay, so if we're thinking about a young girl/woman,
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.420]   'cause we're talking about puberty, right?
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.520]   So I don't know what the exact nomenclature is there.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.220]   My experience is I'll offend somebody no matter what,
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.120]   but a girl who undergoes puberty, right?
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.940]   So a young woman who's maybe 13 or so,
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.740]   so she's early teens, undergoes puberty
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.240]   and therefore is continuing to lose eggs from the vault,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.760]   but now is undergoing, presumably,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.700]   roughly every 28 days, menarche.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.300]   But let's talk about this 28 days thing
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.100]   because I think a lot of people think
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.100]   that quote-unquote normal menstruation is always 28 days.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.520]   And we know that's not true.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.820]   So what is the range of normal durations
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.680]   between menstruations cycles
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.620]   or duration of the menstruation cycle?
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.100]   And let's also define when the menstruation cycle starts,
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.940]   probably for the males mostly in the audience.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.780]   - Sure, sure.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.940]   So let's think through the cycle.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.420]   We'll do a quick one over and then answer the questions.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.700]   So what we think of as cycle day one,
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.260]   or when you're going to say this starts
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.720]   is going to be the day that you start bleeding.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.260]   So that's actually shedding the endometrial lining
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.240]   from what grew the last time.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.380]   - So any spotting even would be considered day one?
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.660]   - Yeah, mm-hmm. - Okay.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.800]   - So it is, we can get back to it,
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.000]   but there's problematic if you have a lot of spotting
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.580]   before that full flow starts.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.040]   A day or so can be really normal
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.780]   just as the body's adjusting to the drop in progesterone.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.300]   But let's just start at the beginning.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.180]   Day one, you have a period of menses.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.180]   This is when you're actually bleeding.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.520]   At this time period, we like to think about
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.360]   all of those new eggs being out of the vault,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.220]   being susceptible to that FSH,
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.860]   which of course is that well-named hormone
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.840]   because it stimulates the follicle to grow
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.700]   and each egg is in a follicle.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.300]   That egg starts to grow and makes estrogen.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.860]   That estrogen stimulates the proliferation
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.020]   of the lining of the uterus in preparation
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.780]   for potentially that pregnancy that may come.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.580]   And also that estrogen makes you feel really great, right?
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.960]   That's the follicular phase,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.160]   name so because that follicle is growing
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.860]   and it's an FSH dominant phase
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.480]   where you have a lot of estrogen.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.380]   - And people feel great when they have a lot of estrogen.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.740]   - Yeah, women feel good with estrogen.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.940]   - Because of the relationship between estrogen
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.100]   and other neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.580]   And is that happening in parallel
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.700]   or are they somehow related?
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.160]   Is estrogen controlling the release of serotonin somehow
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.140]   and vice versa or are they just kind of coincidentally
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.240]   happening in parallel?
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.220]   - We definitely think that there's
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.060]   more of a correlation causation than just coincidence
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.940]   because we know there's time periods of people
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.360]   are more depressed within your cycle,
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.540]   correlating with those low estrogen levels.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.000]   And we know that when you go into menopause
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.060]   or you run out of eggs
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.080]   and you're now in a low estrogen phase,
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.100]   we see a lot more of a depressed mood
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.160]   and anhedonia, lack of response to things
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.820]   which would normally give you pleasure
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.500]   happens more frequently.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.420]   The female brain loves estrogen
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.740]   and it's protective against things like dementia.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.140]   So this is a time period where women
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.980]   are going to be more energetic,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.620]   they're gonna have more energy, more focused.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.340]   This is the estrogen dominant phase of the cycle.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.660]   And when you have seen that estrogen at its high levels,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   which it's only made from a mature follicle
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.580]   and it's very specific,
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.720]   200 picograms per milliliter for 50 hours,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.820]   that's the brain's clue.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.940]   Okay, we must have a mature egg
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.700]   and it can send out that surge of LH or luteinizing hormone.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.100]   And now you ovulate.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.420]   And when you ovulate, the follicle opens up,
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.780]   releases, closes back, and then it's the corpus luteum
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.340]   and we've entered the luteal phase.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.000]   - And the corpus luteum, as the name suggests,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.500]   a corpus, it's like a body that's basically the,
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.900]   it's basically the corpse of what,
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.100]   - It's the dead follicle, yes.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.980]   - Yeah, and sheathed the egg before.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.740]   And what I find so amazing, I mean,
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.900]   biology is so beautiful, right?
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.260]   Instead of just taking that tissue and saying,
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.120]   okay, like, let's just discard this,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.180]   or that becomes the trigger for the next phase of the-
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.100]   - It is essential for life, right?
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.760]   The corpus luteum, which makes progesterone,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.800]   opens and closes the implantation window.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.820]   It is what allows somebody to get pregnant
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.960]   and for our species to continue.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.520]   So it's extremely fascinating.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.640]   And that corpus luteum gets stimulated
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.580]   to produce progesterone impulses
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.260]   throughout the entire luteal phase
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.720]   because it's still controlled by the brain
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.320]   unless you get pregnant.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   And then in that luteal phase, progesterone is fascinating.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.380]   It's trying to protect you from things
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.720]   which could potentially harm your baby.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.000]   So suddenly now you have less energy,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.640]   you wanna sleep more, you wanna eat more,
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.820]   you maybe do not wanna have sex as much
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.000]   because your body is suddenly saying,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.940]   let's just protect this potential implantation
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.520]   that you're going to have.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.960]   If that pregnancy doesn't come,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.200]   the corpus luteum can only live 12 to 14 days.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.540]   It has a very distinct lifespan.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:59.100]   And then it dies, your estrogen and progesterone both drop,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.080]   you bleed starting over the next cycle,
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.440]   and a new group of follicles comes out to be released.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.720]   And the reason why walking through that very succinctly
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.380]   but is important when you're asking
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.200]   how long is the normal cycle?
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.440]   Because the luteal phase is pretty set at 12 to 14 days.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.000]   The follicular phase can vary in person to person.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.320]   And what we know though is for one individual,
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.960]   if your menstrual cycle,
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.640]   your reproductive hormones are working right,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.200]   it should be relatively constant for you.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.080]   And so if your periods are every 24 days,
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.080]   but they've always been every 24 to 25 days,
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.640]   then that's not concerning.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.740]   And if your periods are every 33 days,
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.000]   but they've always been every 33 days,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.600]   then that's not concerning.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.760]   But we do get concerned when there's a change in your period
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.800]   or we get concerned when people have,
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.580]   what I like to say is irregularly regular periods.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.640]   Because what you'll see textbooks tell you
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.760]   is that your periods could be as short as 21 days,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.440]   as long as 35 days, and that can all be normal.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.460]   But people will hop between them
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.640]   and they'll have one cycle that is 24 days in length
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.000]   from day one to the last day before the next day one.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.220]   Then the next cycle is 32, and then it's 26,
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.360]   and then it's 34, and that's not normal.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.200]   That's too irregular.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.280]   And that can be a sign
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.460]   that something is not communicating correctly
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.540]   within your reproductive hormones.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.040]   So what I tell patients is, in general,
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.380]   your period should be less than 35 days apart,
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.580]   and you should be able to look at a calendar,
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.800]   and with your finger, put a finger on the date,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.740]   and within a couple days of accuracy,
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.000]   be able to predict when your period's coming.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.680]   And if you can't, there could likely be something
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.240]   that is interfering with the hormonal signals
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.200]   between the brain and the ovary.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   And one of the biggest, really one of the only things we see
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.800]   as women start to have fewer eggs in the vault
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.020]   is a shortening of their cycles.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.120]   So you have a regular period,
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.760]   and suddenly now you have less eggs in the vault,
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.200]   so less are coming out each month.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.960]   And when the brain sends out that FSH signal,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.620]   now there's fewer eggs, so it's not getting as dilute,
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.120]   and you have one starting to respond sooner.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:18.960]   So suddenly, you're ovulating shorter, faster in your cycle.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.520]   You're ovulating on cycle date nine instead of 14.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.640]   Your luteal phase is still set,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.240]   but the person who comes to see me and says,
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.060]   "My periods have always been 28 to 30 days,
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.780]   but now they're every 24."
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.700]   I just figure it's no big deal.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.760]   I have red flags going off everywhere
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.740]   because I'm now really concerned
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.640]   that potentially their ovarian reserve has dropped
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.200]   to a point where we are starting to see clinical changes.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.760]   Now, of course, things like thyroid and prolactin
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.600]   and other hormones can also cause such changes,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.920]   but that's why you'll hear most reproductive
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.360]   endocrinologists say your period's a vital sign.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.480]   And what we really mean is the regularity at which it comes
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.200]   and the predictability of it is telling us
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.720]   if your hormones are all communicating in a normal fashion
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.240]   or if something could potentially be off.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.080]   - As we all know,
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.160]   quality nutrition influences, of course,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.400]   our physical health, but also our mental health
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.260]   and our cognitive functioning, our memory,
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.640]   our ability to learn new things and to focus.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.800]   And we know that one of the most important features
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.740]   of high quality nutrition is making sure
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.740]   that we get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.360]   from high quality unprocessed or minimally processed sources
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.440]   as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.520]   to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.360]   including the gut microbiome.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.500]   Now, I, like most everybody,
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.560]   try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.280]   ideally mostly from minimally processed
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.740]   or non-processed foods.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:45.840]   However, one of the challenges
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.700]   that I and so many other people face
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.760]   is getting enough servings of high quality fruits
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.720]   and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.920]   that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.940]   That's why way back in 2012,
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.800]   long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.400]   And so I'm delighted that AG1
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.560]   is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.280]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.600]   and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.360]   is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.320]   That is, it provides insurance
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins, minerals,
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.800]   probiotics, and fiber to ensure optimal mental health,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.960]   physical health, and performance.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.380]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.640]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.200]   to claim a special offer.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.960]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.800]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.120]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.020]   to claim that special offer.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.720]   Let me see if I have this correct.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   We've got this thing that we call the menstrual cycle
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.320]   or the ovulatory cycle.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.840]   There's two phases, a follicular phase and a luteal phase.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.340]   Follicular precedes the luteal phase.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.340]   The luteal phase tends to be, if I heard correctly,
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.080]   fairly fixed, about 14 days.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.440]   The follicular phase can vary in duration,
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.920]   maybe 10 to 14 days, maybe even 10 to 18 days,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.080]   depending on something about their brain
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.340]   to overrecommunication.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.480]   For those that aren't familiar with this,
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.920]   I always learned that estrogen primes progesterone.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.020]   That's kind of the really basic top contour description
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.060]   of the ovulatory cycle,
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.480]   that estrogen is going to slowly climb
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.120]   toward the point of ovulation,
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.480]   and then there's a peak and then a drop,
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.120]   and then progesterone is going to dominate
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.180]   in the luteal phase, the second half.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.720]   You said that estrogen is associated
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.120]   with a psychological level and a physiological level,
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.720]   more energy, feelings of vitality,
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.160]   and some of that estrogen increase
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.920]   is actually coming from the one egg
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.400]   that got stimulated the most,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.960]   the one that got selected, right?
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.560]   So it picked for the team, potentially for the team,
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.380]   but got picked potentially for fertilization,
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.320]   and that egg sheds its corpus luteum,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.600]   which is this piece of the egg,
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.880]   that then triggers the progesterone
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.600]   that dominates the luteal phase.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.440]   Do I have that right?
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.500]   - Mostly, mostly. - Okay, yeah,
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.340]   please correct me where I'm wrong.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.680]   - The follicle in which the egg grows, right,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.280]   when you ovulate, it ruptures, the cyst bursts.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.160]   A follicle's a cyst, a cyst is a fluid-filled structure,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.400]   follicle's a fluid-filled structure that holds an egg.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.520]   So when you ovulate and you get that LH surge,
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.180]   the cyst bursts, it opens up, and the egg comes out of it,
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.400]   and then it re-heals and becomes the corpus luteum.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.240]   - Got it.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.800]   - So just a little bit different in timing.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.520]   And you're right with estrogen primes progesterone,
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.120]   but really, we think about it at the layer of the uterus,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.800]   because estrogen stimulates the growth of that lining,
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.120]   and then progesterone stabilizes it
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.040]   and allows implantation to occur.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.320]   But the sequence of events of when you're estrogen dominant
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.180]   and progesterone deficient, which is the follicular phase,
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.400]   and people will come in having labs drawn randomly,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.040]   and they're all concerned that they don't have progesterone.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.400]   And when you talk to them about where they are
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.320]   in their cycle, you say,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.700]   "You're not supposed to have progesterone.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.960]   "That's your follicular phase.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.280]   "This is perfectly normal."
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.480]   - Okay, great, thanks for that clarification.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.680]   I get a lot of questions about birth control,
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.800]   but on my social media handles.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.600]   - Don't we all, don't we all?
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.440]   - To be clear.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.780]   It's a vast topic for exploration,
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.320]   but along the lines of what we're talking about now,
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.620]   I've heard, and I suspect it may not be true, but tell me,
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:32.160]   is there any evidence that taking birth control
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.360]   can disrupt the process that you just described?
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.520]   And when we talk about birth control,
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.040]   we should probably define what we're talking about.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.460]   So there are hormone-based birth controls, AKA the pill.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.960]   There are also hormone-based birth controls
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.260]   that are not in pill form.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.240]   There are IUDs that are copper IUDs.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.200]   There are other IUDs.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.960]   Let's just talk about hormone-based contraception
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.960]   in females, which many of them, as I understand,
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.260]   are estrogen mimics or estrogen themselves
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.840]   that suppress ovulation.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.240]   Do they diminish or increase the number of eggs
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.600]   that are taken from the vault?
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.820]   - Fantastic question.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.800]   Let's talk about what people say is the pill.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.340]   So let's specifically talk about
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.320]   combined oral contraception,
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.560]   the pill which has ethanol estradiol
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.560]   and some type of progestin.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.420]   No, contraception does not change
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.120]   the release of eggs out of the vault.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.800]   They are occurring at the same process and the same pathway.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.440]   You're not ovulating because that estrogen does prevent FSH
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.920]   from coming from the brain.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.480]   So you have the group of eggs still come out of the vault.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.640]   There's no FSH.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.860]   They just all die.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.960]   The next group comes out.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.300]   So when you are saying,
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.760]   are you gonna run out of eggs faster?
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.360]   Is it gonna harm your fertility?
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.780]   Does birth control impair the process?
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.020]   The answer is no.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.220]   But there's a couple important caveats.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.000]   One is that the birth control pills,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.600]   especially if you take them continuously
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.120]   or for a prolonged period of time,
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.920]   the body's smart and the ovaries start to say,
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.760]   well, we're not really doing anything.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.040]   And one of those markers of ovarian reserve we have is AMH
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.100]   and that's antimalarion hormone.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.380]   And AMH is made from the granulosa cells
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.000]   or the cells that surround every follicle.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.280]   So in the shortest way possible,
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.760]   more eggs in the vault, more come out every month,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.960]   higher AMH.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.480]   Fewer eggs in the vault, fewer come out, lower AMH.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.880]   If your AMH is being suppressed
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.520]   because of the birth control pill,
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.120]   because it's decreasing the activity
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.040]   of those granulosa cells,
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   you might get a low AMH value
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.760]   when you've been on the birth control pill for a long time.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.220]   That is completely reversible.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.740]   But it can be significant.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.380]   So if somebody is wanting to get an AMH level,
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.940]   let's say somebody comes to my clinic,
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.060]   they're not trying to get pregnant and they're on the pill
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.320]   and they're considering freezing their eggs
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.880]   so we're going to check their ovarian reserve.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.560]   If we draw it, I always say this,
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.640]   AMH may be up to 30% lower
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.120]   than somebody who is on the birth control pill.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.580]   So we can still draw it.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.080]   And if it comes back in the normal range, we feel good.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.520]   But if it does come back low,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.420]   we're going to have to make a decision.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.520]   Are we going to stop the birth control pill
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.340]   for a period of some months,
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.800]   use alternative contraception
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.920]   if you don't want to be pregnant,
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.080]   and then repeat this test to see if this is a true low
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.120]   because we do see that young women
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.720]   do have low ovarian reserve sometimes,
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.060]   or was this just suppressed
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.780]   because you were on the birth control pill?
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.960]   So we see it impact some of the hormone testing
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.060]   that we can do.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.480]   And I think that's an important distinction.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.020]   And we can see that the longer you take it,
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.940]   that potentially it might actually improve your fertility
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.180]   if you had underlying endometriosis
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.160]   or some medical conditions
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.460]   that we see associated with infertility.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.740]   So prolonged pill users
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.020]   can potentially improve their fertility
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.040]   versus people who are trying to get pregnant
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.680]   that same age who were not on the pill.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.940]   Those studies are complicated, right?
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.080]   Because of selection bias.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.940]   Because if you've been on the pill for 10 years,
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.560]   you're a little bit older.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.740]   So is it that they were preventing pregnancy
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.080]   and the other group potentially had some exposures?
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.200]   So they were inherently more infertile
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.440]   than the group that was on the pill.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.360]   But we do know that the pill doesn't cause infertility.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.700]   And I use it all the time.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.260]   All the time in IVF cycles,
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.560]   we put people on the birth control pill
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.480]   because we can actually synchronize that group of eggs
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.240]   that comes out of the vault to grow together.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.300]   Because your body doesn't want to have
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.180]   20 babies at one time, right?
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.540]   And what we're trying to do with IVF,
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.300]   get 20 eggs to grow if that's what's out of the vault,
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.540]   really goes against the check and balance of the human body
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.500]   to not have 20 babies at once.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.900]   - Why is it that males who take testosterone,
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.400]   synthetic testosterone,
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.580]   it shuts down their own testosterone production
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.540]   and sperm production,
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.020]   but females who take estrogen
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.280]   in the form of birth control pills,
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.100]   doesn't shut down estrogen production by the ovaries?
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.780]   - So I love this question.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.400]   You know the answer, so I like it extra
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.900]   because I know you're asking.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.780]   Spermatogenesis is a constant and ongoing process, right?
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.700]   So in women, you're born with all the eggs
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.960]   you're ever going to have.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.860]   And what we're talking about is if we stop FSH
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.880]   at that moment,
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.600]   we're just impacting the ability to ovulate at that time.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.420]   But we're not changing this constant loss
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.540]   throughout the vault.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.880]   Spermatogenesis, right?
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.700]   The sperm is made every single day.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.060]   You're making brand new sperm.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.180]   So 72 days for the sperm to be created in the testes
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:30.220]   and 18 days to find their way out the ejaculatory system.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.300]   And so exposures that you have
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:36.100]   that stop the production of FSH and LH
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.920]   inhibit the development, the creation of new sperm.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.080]   So somebody who's been on testosterone
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.140]   will tell the brain,
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.860]   the brain doesn't know it's from your taking it.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.140]   It says, "Hey, we have plenty of sperm, we're good.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.440]   We don't need any more."
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.100]   So the brain then gets suppressed
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.660]   and doesn't make that FSH and LH,
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.220]   therefore not stimulating both further testosterone
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.260]   production 'cause you don't need that.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.060]   But testosterone production and sperm production
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:02.940]   go hand in hand.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.940]   So therefore you're no longer making new sperm.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.680]   And in fact, the longer you're on testosterone,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.100]   the harder it may be to get sperm production to come back.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.980]   And in 25% of people, they may not get it back
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.860]   if they've been on prolonged testosterone exposure.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.560]   So it's really because of what women will sometimes say
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.940]   is unfair, which is the fact that you're born
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.760]   with all these eggs and you run out of them.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.660]   They accumulate the wear and tear of your life, right?
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.060]   We see egg quality being a huge issue
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.820]   in female reproduction,
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.360]   yet men get to have new sperm every 90 days.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.820]   They get to wash away whatever bad deeds they did
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.080]   and can change their lifestyle and their exposures
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.160]   and have very different sperm.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.120]   But because of that same process,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.500]   things that shut off the production of FSH, LH
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.040]   really impact sperm quite significantly.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.560]   - You mentioned bad deeds for sperm, not by sperm.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.900]   I said for sperm.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:03.320]   And we know that heat is a pretty dramatic insult
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.860]   to the spermatogenesis cycle,
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.800]   saunas and hot tubs and whatnot.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.260]   I did receive the question as to whether or not
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.120]   heat exposure, saunas, hot tubs, et cetera,
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.480]   are they detrimental to ovulation
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.780]   or egg production in any way?
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.100]   I mean, obviously things are more internal in females.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.040]   The ovaries are internal,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.460]   but is there any evidence for that?
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:24.820]   I mean, the body does heat up.
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:28.340]   - Yeah, it doesn't harm the ovulatory period or the ovaries.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.520]   And just like we know,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.940]   the reason why the testes are so susceptible
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.340]   is because they're supposed to be at a cooler temperature.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.660]   That's why they're in the scrotum outside the body.
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.840]   That's why the testes are so susceptible to heat changes.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.900]   But the ovaries being inside the body,
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.140]   they're not in the same way.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.300]   Now, when somebody's pregnant, important distinction, right?
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.820]   We know that the development,
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.460]   especially organ development of an embryo,
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.580]   can be more sensitive to certain things.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.460]   And that heat exposure at that time,
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.420]   whether it's hot tub use or extreme fevers,
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.700]   even can make a difference in development of a fetus.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.660]   But when it's coming to the ovulatory cycle
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.980]   or hormone production,
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.820]   heat in the female doesn't make any difference.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.860]   - I want to be clear before I ask the next question
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.380]   that I don't want to be responsible
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.700]   for any unwanted pregnancies.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.020]   But when I was in high school,
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.620]   they told us that women can get pregnant
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.980]   even while they have their period.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.800]   Is that true?
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.700]   It seems like a lie based on everything you're saying,
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.140]   but I don't want anyone to run out
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.560]   and test that hypothesis without having the facts first.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.740]   - So in general, if somebody has extremely regular cycles,
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.460]   then that's a complete lie.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.420]   You can't get pregnant on your period.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.020]   The reason why they tell us this is one,
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.540]   especially when you're younger,
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.500]   your period cycles tend to be irregular.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.220]   They're not, your body hasn't fully matured
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.020]   to have that regularity.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.460]   And that we know that sperm do live
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.780]   in the reproductive tract for much longer than the egg does.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.780]   So sperm can live there for up to five days.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.100]   So if somebody did have a shorter period window,
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.980]   let's say their normal periods are going to be 24 days,
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.260]   they're ovulating on cycle day 10.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.020]   If they have a regular period that's five or six days,
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.660]   they could potentially have intercourse
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.300]   that end part of that period.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.820]   The sperm could live for five days
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.100]   and be right there when you have the egg en route.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.700]   So it's not the most fertile time for sure.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.560]   And in most people that is considered a time
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.540]   when you're not going to get pregnant,
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:31.740]   but especially when you're younger
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.180]   and you have more irregularity
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.120]   or in people who have a short cycle window,
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.900]   that might not be the case.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.020]   - So by extension, can we conclude then
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.380]   that the most fertile time is going to be
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.460]   when sperm meets egg,
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:49.300]   let's say timing of intercourse for the time being,
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.580]   but 'cause there's can be a delay there,
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.340]   when sperm meets egg on obviously day of ovulation
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.420]   or day after?
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.580]   - Day of. - Day of.
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.160]   - The egg lives for 24 hours.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.500]   So the egg can only be fertilized for 24 hours
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.300]   while it's in the fallopian tube.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.780]   Once the egg has entered the uterus,
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.460]   it can't be fertilized anymore.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.820]   So it has this very short window of time
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.760]   where it will allow sperm to enter it.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.380]   Now, sperm can live for five days.
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.760]   So we'll say the fertile window is this five-day period
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.840]   ending on the day of ovulation.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.380]   You will hear a lot of us, a lot of doctors
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.060]   say the day after ovulation,
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.020]   because do you really know exactly what time
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.040]   you ovulated on?
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.140]   And if the egg has 24 hours,
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.340]   then that extra day could potentially be helpful.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.100]   But really it's five days ending on the day of ovulation.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.060]   And people with very regular cycles or who can track them
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.620]   and they know when that ovulation is happening,
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.120]   the day before and the day of ovulation,
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.500]   those are the two top heading days.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.460]   So if you're kind of not in the mood to have lots of sex,
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.640]   those are going to be the days you target
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.100]   to have the highest chance of conceiving.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.460]   - And what is the relationship between estrogen, libido,
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.260]   and ovulation in females?
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.980]   - The higher your estrogen is,
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.740]   the increased libido that you're going to have.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.220]   And of course you see those peak estrogen levels,
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.400]   which are going to trigger that LH surge.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.860]   So the body is made to get pregnant.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.400]   You're going to have that peak estrogen,
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.960]   that peak libido right before
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.420]   and right at that ovulatory time period
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.840]   so that hopefully you also want to have intercourse
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.340]   and get pregnant.
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.300]   - I've heard before, let's just say,
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.900]   that some people, I have to be careful here,
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:33.620]   can sense the, literally the deployment of the egg,
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:36.660]   the ovulation, they report that they can feel
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.620]   that the, let's just say, the departure of the egg.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:44.100]   Is that an imaginary thing?
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.700]   - No, no, that's very real.
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.620]   - I always liked that image
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.220]   that people can know when that happens, right?
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.060]   - It's so real it has a name.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.140]   - I mean, after all, men generally know
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.540]   when their sperm are leaving their body.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.500]   Let's hope they do.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:59.620]   But why wouldn't there be an internal sense
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.460]   for women also of what's going on?
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.620]   I mean, we have interoception.
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.740]   There's a ton of nerve innervation of that area.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.100]   - It doesn't communicate to the brain, excellent,
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.500]   as far as tracking to where that sensation is.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.100]   But you're right.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.600]   I already said ovulation is the rupture of assist, right?
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.060]   It is rupturing and the egg is being released
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.080]   and those follicular fluid is also exiting
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.020]   and going into the peritoneal cavity.
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.180]   And so there is a group of women who can feel that,
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.900]   especially people who are very in tune with their body.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.660]   And it has a name, it's called middle schmertz.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:36.340]   The pain almost feels like a crampy pain
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.680]   that happens in the middle of the cycle.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.340]   And that is your ovulatory pain.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.780]   - How interesting, what is it called?
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.820]   - Middle schmertz.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.520]   - Okay, we'll put that in the show note captions
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.340]   and whoever does it is going to have to
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.220]   get the spelling right, middle schmertz.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.340]   Amazing, amazing, amazing and foreign to me,
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.720]   but for obvious reasons, but amazing.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:01.820]   I'm always astonished in how incredibly well
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.020]   orchestrated this whole process is.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:08.360]   It's just such an incredible feat of biology.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.300]   I mean, the number of things that have to be timed correctly
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.260]   and the use and I don't want to say reuse,
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.260]   but the repurposing of tissues for different things
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.340]   and like it's, what an incredible dance.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.020]   That's just amazing. - It's beautiful.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.780]   I mean, I'm so nerdy because I just love
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.600]   how everything has to communicate just perfectly.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.040]   It makes you in awe of all the pregnancies
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.140]   that just happen just all the time
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.580]   because really things have to synchronize
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.380]   really at the wonderful time period.
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.700]   And even though this isn't what we're talking about,
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.660]   I've heard you say this, so I want to say this.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.840]   People always ask every single day,
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.700]   well, how much sex should you have?
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.900]   When should you have sex?
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.260]   Is there too much sex?
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:47.460]   And what we know is that you definitely should not decrease
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.580]   your sexual intercourse interval.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.300]   So if you are in a relationship
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.700]   and you are sex everyday people, have sex every day.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.140]   You will 100% hit intercourse
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:58.640]   throughout your entire fertile window
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.180]   on the day that you ovulate.
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.740]   You're depositing the same sperm there
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.660]   because you're not generating new sperm.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.380]   It's whether the load went half and half and half and half,
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.660]   or if it went in one big group.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.860]   But if you're constantly putting more sperm out there,
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.060]   you have a higher chance.
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:20.380]   And so studies go back and always say daily intercourse,
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.620]   as I say, with the highest chance of fecundability,
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.840]   especially during the fertile window.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.880]   However, for couples who are not sex everyday people,
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.560]   that idea can cause a lot of stress.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.460]   Stress, of course, impacts the system
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.940]   in a lot of different ways.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.580]   It can also cause sexual burnout,
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:41.560]   where they no longer feel like being intimate or having sex
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.120]   on the day they're actually ovulating,
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.720]   because they've been doing it this whole time leading up.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.760]   And that's where the time period of saying,
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.620]   have sex every other day throughout the fertile window,
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.120]   so starting five or six days
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.200]   before you think you're going to ovulate,
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.040]   and then try to target having intercourse
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:01.020]   on the day before and the day of ovulation.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.580]   And the reason why people said every other day
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.660]   or a few days prior to kind of get some sperm exposure there
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.400]   in case you ovulated early,
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.220]   but really to try to prevent some of that increased stress
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.900]   that can happen when you're trying to conceive,
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.800]   especially if you have programmed or timed intercourse
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.620]   that needs to happen on an everyday interval.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.340]   But the odds of getting pregnant
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.660]   by saving up sperm for two or three days, that's not higher.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:30.380]   - I'm curious then why, if let's just say hypothetically,
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:34.100]   someone is donating or freezing sperm or doing IVF,
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.580]   why they instruct the male to not ejaculate
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.660]   for 48 to 72 hours prior to,
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.740]   let's just say depositing sperm is such a funny word,
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.920]   but it works, so.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.760]   - Two points.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.660]   One, if we're doing a semen analysis,
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.060]   now we're trying to evaluate the sperm,
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.140]   and any test has certain normal parameters,
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.900]   and these are all based on a 48 to 72 hour abstinence period.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.980]   So yes, if you ejaculate more frequently,
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.980]   you're going to have less sperm,
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:06.180]   and that can be very normal,
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.100]   but if we're looking at a test with set normal parameters
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.740]   that are based on two to three days
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.180]   of not having intercourse,
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.260]   that's why we want you to do it for that.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:19.380]   If we're doing, let's say, IUI or intrauterine insemination,
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.880]   also known as artificial insemination,
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.180]   or where we take the sperm and put it in a catheter
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:25.800]   and put it in the uterus,
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.940]   we're trying to get more players further down the field,
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.500]   and in that case, I know when you ovulate
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.360]   because I'm timing it perfectly,
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.440]   and I am trying to get as many possible in this process,
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.680]   because we're not just having them deposited in the vagina,
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.420]   we're trying to get them further.
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.340]   So we want more
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.380]   because that's part of that treatment process.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.860]   And similarly with IVF,
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.180]   I want to have as many sperm as possible to sort through
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.200]   and pick out the best looking, the most modal,
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.260]   the most normally shaped ones.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.720]   So we're trying to get just a better sample.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.720]   And by having these normal guidelines,
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.820]   we're able to judge this is low for what it should be,
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.940]   which can also be a clue to other problems.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.420]   - I definitely want to talk about chemistry,
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.020]   both sort of interpersonal chemistry
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.340]   and literally ejaculate and vaginal chemistry.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.220]   But before we do that,
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.480]   I'm curious whether or not we can just touch on
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.340]   a few of the things that a lot of people wonder about
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.400]   in terms of egg quality.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.280]   And if they touch on sperm quality,
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.400]   maybe we can also just mention that.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.020]   But for instance,
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:30.260]   does cannabis,
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.740]   either by edible or by smoking cannabis,
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.240]   impact egg quality in either direction?
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.760]   Alcohol would be the next.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.100]   And then I'm going to assume,
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.200]   and I have to do this strictly because of what I understand
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.880]   about drugs of abuse,
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.220]   like cocaine and amphetamine, methamphetamine,
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.020]   that none of those can be good for systems of the body
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:51.860]   because they provide,
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.100]   they create so much stress for the body.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.100]   But let's just say alcohol and cannabis.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.660]   I read a statistic when researching the episode on cannabis
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.580]   that shocked me, which is that 15%,
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.780]   one five percent,
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.060]   not 1.5, 15% of American women,
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:12.220]   at least in this one study, survey,
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:16.180]   reported having consumed or smoked cannabis
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.100]   during known pregnancy.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.500]   Which is wild. - Wild.
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.540]   - Unless of course, I'm just naive
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.380]   and THC is not harmful to the fetus,
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.760]   but I have a hard time believing that.
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.820]   So what gives?
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.300]   I mean, and there I actually just threw in
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:34.180]   fetal development.
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:39.180]   So is cannabis, is alcohol bad for egg quality?
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.340]   - So there are different things
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.340]   and they're the same thing in one.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.820]   So let's answer them each individually.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.460]   So we'll go with the one that everybody knows
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.780]   and has accepted now
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.640]   that they wouldn't have accepted 40 years ago, right?
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.540]   Smoking cigarettes.
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.440]   So that's obviously bad.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.740]   Decreases the number of eggs you have in the vault.
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.540]   Smoking cigarettes actually gets into your vault,
[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.800]   decreases the number that you have.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.440]   You have a higher chance of going into menopause earlier
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.560]   and it increases the risk of having abnormal chromosomes,
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.200]   which is what we really think about
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.780]   when we think about egg quality, right?
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.000]   Impacting those myotic spindles inside the eggs,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.860]   which hold the chromosomes in their perfect position.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:15.100]   They are associated, they get wear and tear
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.200]   from things that cause inflammation or are toxic.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.280]   So cigarette smoke, we know decreases egg quality,
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.780]   egg quantity, increases miscarriage,
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.600]   and then of course has fetal impacts.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.440]   - Could I just ask you,
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.800]   because when we talk about there's nicotine,
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.320]   which itself is not carcinogenic,
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.720]   and then there's the smoking process,
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.520]   which brings in a bunch of other things.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.480]   The question I know is burning in everybody's mind
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.000]   is vaping, right?
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.580]   Because vaping is, I'm very bullish on this.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.020]   I mean, it's very clear that the chemicals
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.200]   associated with vaping are just,
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.720]   oh, so bad for everybody's health,
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:49.720]   but it's distinctly different from saying
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.840]   that nicotine is bad for one's health.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:57.000]   And it can be, but without doing too much of a deep dive,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.320]   are there any data that show
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.320]   that vaping is bad for egg quality?
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.840]   - Of course there's not as much data
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.520]   because it just hasn't been around as long.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.560]   But yes, vaping definitely has chemicals
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.160]   that looks like it's associated
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.600]   with poor success rates and IVF cycles.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.280]   And that's really kind of one of the most finite measures
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.640]   of egg quality we can see,
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.540]   because we're really testing the egg at a level in a lab
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:21.920]   versus just, are you getting pregnant naturally?
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:23.140]   - And sorry to interject again,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.040]   but anytime a conversation like this comes up,
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.620]   especially between two people in the health science space,
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:31.640]   there are these shouts, 'cause I hear them, literally,
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.800]   where people say, well, listen, I vaped every day
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.140]   and I've had three healthy babies.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.040]   And I think that my response is always,
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.140]   okay, there's going to be a distribution of responses.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:41.980]   And then of course,
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.120]   how much healthier could your babies have been
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.800]   had you not vaped during pregnancy
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.160]   or vaped prior to pregnancy?
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.200]   Or, I mean, I think these are the key issues
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.600]   that like you can't rewind the clock, as far as I know,
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.960]   right, in the absence of a time machine,
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.900]   you can't rewind the clock.
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.500]   So, I mean, basically everything you're saying
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.300]   is that smoking cigarettes or vaping nicotine
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.200]   just can't be good for egg quality.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.040]   - We know that.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.480]   We know that it's not good for getting pregnant.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.360]   We know that it's not good for sperm.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:12.760]   And therefore, we also know it's going to impact
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   pregnancy rates, you know, things like cannabis, right,
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.240]   decreases sperm production, decreases sperm motility,
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.360]   changes sperm morphology, the shape of it,
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.200]   changes the DNA, increases the fragmentation of the DNA.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.040]   If your partner uses cannabis and you get pregnant,
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.020]   you have a higher chance of miscarriage
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:34.120]   because of the sperm association with the cannabis.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.480]   - Edible cannabis as well as smoke cannabis.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.320]   - I don't know, right,
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.280]   because you can't study something that's illegal.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.180]   So a lot of this data is just more new
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.200]   and a lot of it's going to be observational.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.040]   - And in states like Colorado and California,
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.760]   where, you know, canvas is essentially legal,
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:52.020]   I'm assuming that there are more data, but okay.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:57.020]   So smoking and or vaping nicotine,
[00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.680]   cannabis, either edible or smoked,
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.240]   very likely detrimental to egg quality and sperm quality,
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.080]   which is not to say that one can't conceive.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.920]   It just means that the quality of your baby,
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.720]   your child will not be as high as the quality of that baby
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.660]   if you didn't do that, is that right?
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.500]   - Yes.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:19.660]   - And I'm not trying to demonize anyone
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.480]   that did do this during pregnancy.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.760]   A lot of people didn't know,
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.580]   but this is really about people trying to make choices
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.540]   in anticipation of future pregnancy.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.780]   - Yeah, and when you're trying to set yourself up
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.480]   for success, because we know infertility
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.580]   is becoming more common.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:36.120]   We don't always know who is going to have it.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.000]   And when you find yourself in that position specifically,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.360]   you now want to optimize everything you can.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.520]   So if there's something that is going to make
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.320]   the sperm quality worse and the egg quality worse
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.560]   and your success with treatment lower
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.840]   and your miscarriage rate higher,
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.960]   we're going to recommend that you not do it.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.720]   If you're trying to get pregnant naturally,
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.220]   all these things correlate over, but of course,
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.880]   there's always going to be outliers and exceptions.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.240]   I'm going to sit here and tell you
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.580]   that the odds of getting pregnant at age 43
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.540]   are less than 3% per month.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.060]   And every single person is going to be like,
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.940]   but my Aunt Barbara, or I know this person who did,
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.980]   because 3% is not zero.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.840]   - And you're talking about natural pregnancy there
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.220]   by intercourse?
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.380]   - Having old fashioned way, yes.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.480]   Right, but yes, so people will get pregnant.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.900]   People will have healthy children who do have exposures
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.380]   to nicotine, to cannabis, even to alcohol.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.580]   Even though we know that alcohol
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.560]   can cause fetal alcohol syndrome,
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.560]   0% of alcohol should be the acceptable level in pregnancy.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.440]   And then does alcohol impact fertility?
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.300]   Such a complicated question.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.600]   And this is probably due to the amount you consume
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.760]   and the frequency of which you consume it.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.920]   Alcohol is a toxin that your liver must filter out
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.000]   and we know it causes inflammation.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.800]   Anybody who's had a fun night with alcohol
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.220]   knows they can wake up the next day and they feel different.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.960]   Their body is processing that alcohol.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.200]   And that inflammation, especially if it's chronic,
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.640]   chronic exposure, we know chronic inflammation
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.520]   is one of the things that we see
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.920]   impacting egg quality and sperm quality.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.520]   So certainly if you enjoy alcohol,
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.000]   it should be something that is done in moderation,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.920]   one or two drinks a week at the most,
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.480]   and you should not do it at all
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.240]   once you find out you're pregnant.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.440]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.120]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.400]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.040]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.520]   to help you better understand your body
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.360]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.160]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.320]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.920]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.880]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.340]   however, is that they'll give you information
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:49.500]   about certain lipid markers or hormone markers,
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.560]   but no information about what to do with all of that data.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.920]   Inside Tracker makes it very easy
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.400]   to look at your levels of hormones,
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.600]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.660]   and then to assess what sorts of behavioral, nutritional,
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.600]   supplementation, or perhaps other interventions
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.000]   you might want to use in order to bring those numbers
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.280]   into the ranges that are optimal for your health.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.320]   Inside Tracker's ultimate plan now includes
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.860]   three new hormone markers that are critical to measure
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.380]   during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.280]   These are estradiol, progesterone,
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.180]   and thyroid stimulating hormone.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.580]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.480]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.600]   When we were talking about birth control,
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.120]   I unfortunately moved us forward
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.520]   and forgot to ask about IUDs.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.920]   So my understanding is that the copper IUD works
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.000]   by creating a sort of, not actually electric,
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   but a kind of a electric fence that kills sperm.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.760]   Sperm don't like copper. - I love that analogy.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.860]   Yeah, I love that one. - Sperm don't like copper.
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.580]   Copper likes to kill sperm.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.300]   There's some interesting history.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.860]   I've been reading a lot on the history of medicine
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.900]   of people who, you know, for whatever reason,
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.480]   were forced into or chose to be in the sex trade,
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.920]   prostitutes using, inserting copper coins
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.720]   into their vaginal tract to try and kill sperm,
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.040]   but to varying degrees of success.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.980]   Obviously, there's a whole socioeconomic landscape
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.320]   around that, so I think it's obvious what I'm referring to,
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.880]   but very interesting, but that's just one form of IUD.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.960]   Right, there are some other IUDs,
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.740]   and then there's, of course, the ring.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.600]   We didn't talk about that.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.480]   So maybe we just touch on a few of those
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.340]   within the context of whether or not it alters egg quality
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.740]   and/or future fertility when one takes the ring out,
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:36.880]   takes the IUD out.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.760]   - This is a great question
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.520]   because a lot of people don't know this,
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.100]   and I'll roll through a few of the top birth control methods
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.480]   and just thinking through.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.300]   Copper IUD, as you already said, no hormonal involvement.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.660]   It causes inflammation and a toxic environment
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.940]   inside the uterus, isolated,
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:53.120]   does cause sometimes heavier periods,
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.880]   but they should still be regular.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.720]   If they are irregular, that's a sign of a hormonal issue
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.000]   because you still ovulate with the copper IUD.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.680]   - Is it literally a copper wire woven
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.080]   into the tissue of the uterus?
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.960]   - Well, the IUD is a little T,
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.660]   and the arms have copper wires wrapped around them.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.640]   - And those are, they grow into the uterine lining?
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.000]   - They don't grow into the uterine lining.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.360]   The IUD just sits in there,
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.640]   and just the presence of that copper
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.480]   causes that inflammatory reaction
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.720]   in that toxic environment.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.560]   - And is it toxic to the environment
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.120]   in ways that are detrimental to the woman or just to sperm?
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:25.960]   - Both.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.680]   I mean, implantation is not going to occur likely, right?
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.480]   I mean, nothing is 100% successful,
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   but it's much harder for an embryo to implant
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.640]   within that highly inflammatory environment.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.000]   - To me, amazing that people figured this out before-
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.720]   - Oh, it's fascinating. - The advent of laboratories.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.540]   - Right?
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.280]   Let's just put some copper in some uteruses
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.780]   and see what happens.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.840]   - You know, it really speaks to the urgency
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.840]   that must have existed to preventing pregnancy
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.440]   and just how costly, biologically and financially,
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.280]   pregnancy is.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.440]   - And pregnancy is not health neutral,
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.880]   so it is something that somebody needs to be
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.720]   of right health, or it can be a deadly circumstance.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.240]   When we get back to other IUDs,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.720]   so IUDs that more people are more familiar with
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.200]   are the progesterone-based IUDs.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.880]   This is going to be your Mirena, Kylina, Lyletta.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.120]   They have a bunch of different names
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.900]   based on the amount of progesterone
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.520]   and how long they last for.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.760]   These work mostly by thinning out the uterine lining.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.120]   As we already said, progesterone compacts the uterine lining
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.640]   to prepare it for implantation in a normal cycle.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:33.120]   But if you have constant exposure to progesterone,
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.680]   what is going to happen is it's going to prevent
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.280]   the uterine lining from growing,
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.800]   and it gets it very, very thin.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.760]   Not all IUDs, in fact, most of them don't prevent ovulation.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.400]   Only in about 50% of people
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.700]   do they actually prevent ovulation.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.560]   So their main mechanism of action
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.360]   is this endometrial effect.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.680]   When you remove the IUD,
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.240]   especially if you're already ovulating, no problem.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.660]   The problem we do see in some people with progesterone IUDs
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.600]   that maybe isn't talked about as much
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.880]   is that this prolonged progesterone exposure,
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.640]   because people are putting IUDs in for five to seven years
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.200]   and not having a period for that length of time
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.280]   because the endometrium has become so atrophic
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.820]   or nonexistent that you're no longer bleeding
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.020]   despite the fact that you may be ovulating.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.780]   It can take a while for that lining to grow back.
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:28.700]   And so it's not uncommon to have an IUD in place,
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.440]   and if you have no period, you're gonna say,
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.580]   "This is great, I don't have a period, wonderful."
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:37.540]   You get it removed, and now your period hasn't come back.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.780]   And that leads people to sometimes be concerned
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.060]   that the IUD is causing them not to ovulate
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:46.480]   or they have this infertility caused by the IUD,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.280]   but really what it is is that the lining's become so, so thin
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.700]   that it can take many months
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.460]   of that unopposed estrogen exposure in the follicular phase
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.280]   to get it thick enough to finally bleed
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.740]   when you're ovulating.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.140]   So I do tell people if they have a progesterone IUD
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.280]   to get it removed three to six months
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.340]   before they wanna get pregnant,
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.540]   use some other form of contraception,
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.920]   but give their body time to make sure
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.600]   they have that regular period pattern back.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.200]   Important distinction, if you're still ovulating
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.360]   and having a period on an IUD,
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.940]   then this is gonna be less of a concern
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.080]   because if you're growing enough of a lining
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   to then shed it, we're less worried about it.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.840]   But if you are amenorrheic
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.740]   or have absence of your periods with an IUD,
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.920]   we need to think about removing it for a period of time
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.160]   before you get pregnant
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.320]   so that your body can grow that lining again.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.880]   When it comes to some of the other things that you mentioned,
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.680]   one you didn't ask that I wanna mention
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.640]   is the Depo-Provera shot.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.560]   The Depo-Provera shot is a high dose of progesterone,
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.280]   high enough to actually prevent ovulation.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.240]   So in that circumstance, you are not ovulating
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.540]   and therefore if you don't ovulate,
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.360]   you're not going to get pregnant.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:59.280]   Depo-Provera is proven to prevent ovulation
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.200]   for three months.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.880]   So when you take it, you need to get it every three months
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.460]   to have a proven contraceptive benefit.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.940]   However, it can last in your system for 18 months
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:13.780]   and prevent ovulation for up to 18 months.
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.580]   So I will see people who liked that option
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:19.100]   for contraception and now they haven't had a period
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.300]   in a long time but their last Depo shot was six months ago
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.460]   and they're all frustrated by the fact when I tell them,
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:29.180]   well, you still may not have another period for a year plus
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.860]   because this high level of progesterone
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.340]   that you've already injected into your system
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.300]   can last a substantial amount of time.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.680]   So that is a contraceptive option that I tell people
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.440]   to discontinue a year and a half to two years
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.780]   before they want to get pregnant,
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.920]   which sometimes people don't know that yet.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.360]   And so that's something that can be a contraceptive option
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.560]   for if you're very remote from wanting to have a child.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.480]   But in people who are in their childbearing years
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.400]   contemplating family building soon,
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.500]   that is not my favorite option.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.920]   - So you haven't mentioned, because I haven't asked,
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.580]   any negative consequences of birth control of any kind.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.800]   And I'm not encouraging you to, if you don't believe in them,
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.160]   I know that this is a very controversial topic,
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.200]   but one of the more popular studies discussed
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.520]   on social media is one that I've spent some time
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.280]   with the paper and a few of the papers that stemmed from it.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Not a huge study, but describing that how women rate
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.700]   the faces of men as either more,
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.600]   essentially what happens is there seems to be,
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.480]   at least in this study,
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.480]   there was a statistically significant bias
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.960]   for women to select particular male faces as attractive.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.640]   And those male faces tended to be of the more, you know,
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.100]   square jaw, AKA masculine features, right?
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.200]   In air quotes, right?
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:56.000]   This is what the study found.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.840]   But that when women were on oral contraception,
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.140]   presumably estrogen progestin type oral contraception,
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.940]   that that effect was smeared.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.660]   They had not a statistically significant tendency
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.160]   to choose the quote unquote more masculine faces.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.560]   I have to be very careful with my language here
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.320]   because, you know, it's easy to get description
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.440]   of a study like this wrong.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440]   And that has led a lot of people to think
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.500]   that birth control is going to throw off
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.640]   their partner choice.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.000]   Now, of course, it is a small study.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.420]   Studies like it are not always so well controlled.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.800]   But is there any evidence that birth control,
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.820]   oral estrogen progestin based birth control,
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.840]   just to keep it specific, can increase rates of cancers,
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.720]   can decrease rates of cancers,
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.640]   can lead to any sorts of disruptions
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.260]   in bodily function or health?
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.620]   That's really like a rock solid result.
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.620]   That's been seen by multiple studies, clinical trials,
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.180]   or are we still just in the dark about a lot of this stuff?
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.300]   Okay, so nothing is without risk.
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.820]   Getting pregnant is not without risk.
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.420]   Taking the birth control pill is not without risk.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:11.420]   We do see that there's been a lot of not informed consent
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.820]   in people who are taking the birth control pill,
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.940]   meaning maybe they weren't educated
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.420]   about what all of their options were,
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.460]   the positives and the negatives about each one of them.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.860]   If we're gonna reference the convo to the pill,
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.380]   estrogen progesterone pill,
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.380]   important to understand that neither the estrogen
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.000]   nor the progesterone are the same estrogen progesterone
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.780]   that your ovaries make, right?
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.180]   It's ethanol estradiol,
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:35.740]   which your brain interprets as an estrogen,
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.860]   but other parts of your body may not.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.820]   And then it's various types of progestins,
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.740]   some of which have even androgenic
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.460]   or male hormone-like properties, and some of which do not.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.300]   So there's a ton of variation,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.660]   even the amount of ethanol estradiol that each pill has,
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:55.420]   with your low low and your low pills having less,
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.660]   and even with the modern day average pill
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.320]   having a lot less estrogen than it used to.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.400]   When you're on the birth control pill,
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.680]   your ovaries aren't making estradiol.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.440]   And that estradiol is important
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.680]   in growing the uterine lining,
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.120]   but also for the genital structures.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:17.220]   And so we think about vaginal health and vulvar health.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.600]   We certainly see that especially with continuous use.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:24.800]   So if we distinguish you take the pill for 21 days
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.080]   and you have a seven day break where you might bleed
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.740]   or you take sugar pills, and then you take them again,
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:32.480]   a lot of people now are taking continuously
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.620]   where you have exposure to these compounds every single day.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:41.620]   - So in like the wheel, the little pouch with the wheel
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.460]   of different colored pills,
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.160]   may have seen these on the counter shop
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.960]   in previous relationships.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.880]   And then there's the ones that sometimes people
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.880]   just opt not to take, because those are the,
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.040]   not the placebo, they're the sugar pills.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.480]   There's no need to take estrogen during that phase.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.040]   And then, and then they repeat, is that-
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:58.880]   - Exactly.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.360]   - Okay, but some people are taking estrogen-
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.560]   - Continuously, it's very common right now.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.540]   So people, and they're not wrong.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.160]   They say, oh, well, why have a period
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.320]   in these little breaks?
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.360]   It's not really a reflection of my hormone status,
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.440]   which is accurate.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.640]   And so they're taking them continuously.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.180]   You also have less pill failure pregnancies.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.120]   So if you're using the pill for contraception,
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.800]   that can be a great strategy.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.760]   But the longer you take them,
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.080]   we do see some vaginal and vulvar changes, right?
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.360]   And so atrophic vaginitis, people who notice
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.400]   increased sensitivity, decreased elasticity,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.400]   increase discomfort with intercourse,
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.440]   increase in yeast infections, that can sometimes be seen
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.040]   because that environment is different.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.040]   Now, that's just one thing that can come from the pill.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.320]   We also see the pill be lifesaving for other people.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.080]   They have terrible PMS, or premenstrual dysphoric syndrome,
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.160]   where their mental health, when they change
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.360]   from high to low estrogen, it's always the change
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.360]   in estrogen that interferes, can cause some people
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.740]   to really have mental health issues that are so severe
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:06.060]   that having that stable hormone level is helpful.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.160]   And so the pill can be extremely beneficial
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.360]   for some people when it comes to mental health.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:13.680]   It can be beneficial for people who have issues
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.640]   with very heavy periods and anemia.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.520]   Instead of getting blood transfusions,
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.200]   taking the birth control pill might prevent the lining
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.040]   of the uterus from growing so much that they bleed so much.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.520]   Same thing with fibroids, people with PCOS.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.280]   PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.160]   If we wanna put it very simply,
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.480]   you have a lot of eggs in your vault,
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.640]   so you release a lot of eggs every month.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.120]   And what this does is the FSH signal gets diluted,
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.080]   and so you're not responding to the normal signal
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.600]   and you don't ovulate.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.120]   And because the ovary is a hormone-making factory,
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.080]   it gets really bored when it can't make estrogen
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.400]   'cause that egg's not growing,
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.240]   so it starts to make testosterone.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.920]   So you start to see this androgen-dominant environment
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.280]   associated with lack of ovulation
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.600]   and having a lot of follicles inside the ovary
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.960]   that are not really responding.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.720]   - And the androgenization of other tissues,
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.720]   like body hair, deepening of voice?
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.040]   - Yeah, body hair.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.000]   Typically, the level of testosterone made in PCOS
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.440]   isn't truly deepening voice.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.200]   It can if there is an ovarian tumor making testosterone
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.300]   or certain other conditions.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:22.320]   But typically with PCOS, you see increase in body hair,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.960]   increase in acne, and you can see some even male pattern
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.700]   balding, some temporal balding of women, so some hair loss.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.740]   - Temporal balding, so like the widow's peaking?
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:33.680]   - Yeah, the widow peaking and then thinning out
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.400]   in these two areas.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.920]   And then we see an increase in body composition
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.840]   towards the male level.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.320]   So if we think about a male body holding your fat
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.280]   in your abdominal region,
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.600]   and if we think about the traditional female body
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.560]   holding more fat in the hips and thighs area,
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.260]   we see that when this hormone shifts in PCOS,
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.860]   you tend to get more abdominal fat distribution,
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:58.460]   which then leads to further insulin resistance
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.900]   and metabolic syndrome.
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:03.080]   But in PCOS, because you're not ovulating,
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:07.360]   and those ovaries, each little follicle
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.380]   makes a tiny amount of estrogen.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.720]   We'll say each little follicle, when it's not responding,
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.700]   will make one to two picograms of estrogen.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.640]   But if you have 50 of them each month,
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.920]   you're having some constant estrogen exposure.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.240]   So that lining of the uterus
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.360]   is being constantly stimulated to grow,
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.300]   and you're never getting the progesterone to stabilize
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.600]   or the progesterone withdrawal to bleed.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.460]   So endometrial cancer is much higher
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.280]   in people with PCOS who don't ovulate,
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.020]   and the birth control pill can prevent that.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.480]   Any unopposed estrogen situation,
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.240]   because the body is made to have
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.840]   both estrogen and progesterone.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.840]   So we see an immense decrease in endometrial cancer,
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.880]   an immense drop in ovarian cancer.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.760]   Ovarian cancer comes from the remodeling of the ovary.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.760]   So every time you have a follicle grow, and it ruptures,
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.800]   and it makes the corpus luteum, and then it heals up,
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.820]   those are opportunities for those cancer cells
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.200]   to go away in that remodeling process
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.520]   and lead to ovarian cancer.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.960]   And because you're not ovulating on the pill,
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.440]   your incidence of ovarian cancer drops dramatically.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.520]   10 years of pill use has dropped the chance
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.320]   you get ovarian cancer by more than 90%.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:19.800]   And of course, ovarian cancer is super hard to diagnose
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:23.800]   because the innervation to the peritoneal system is poor,
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.320]   and you don't have any outward signs,
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.660]   often till late-stage disease.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:31.860]   That being said, could you potentially have an increase
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.200]   in breast cancer in some people?
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.040]   - By taking the pill?
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.000]   - By taking the pill.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.400]   That's a concern, especially in people
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.920]   who might be predisposed to this for some other reason.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.400]   - So they might have BRCA mutations
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.920]   or something like that.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.280]   - And then is there a situation where the pill
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.760]   certainly masks what's going on with your menstrual cycle?
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.040]   And I really think this is where women's health
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.120]   has a huge history in paternalism,
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.200]   meaning doctors will just tell people,
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.640]   this is what you're going to do.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.400]   So your periods are irregular,
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.200]   here is the birth control pill.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.000]   And they're not explaining why or the pros and cons to it.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.760]   And what happens is people are not being taught
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.520]   how their bodies work, and now they are
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.400]   because of your podcast amongst others.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.880]   And now they're able to know that my period's a vital sign
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.560]   and I don't know what it is because the pill
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.920]   is producing a different environment.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.880]   The pill's also been associated with potentially development
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.340]   of things like leaky gut or IBS.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:32.720]   And so there is a definite change in your environment
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.060]   when you're on the birth control pill.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.640]   Increased risk of blood clots
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.920]   because of how it's processed in the liver,
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.480]   increasing your clotting factors.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   - Can I just interrupt there?
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:46.480]   I'm aware that a fairly high percentage of people
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:52.600]   have mutations in factor V Leiden, a clotting factor.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.000]   Fewer people are, as we say, homozygous,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.960]   have two deficient copies, mutant copies, I should say.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.960]   But there are many people out there
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.920]   that have one mutant copy of factor V Leiden.
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.760]   And my understanding is that oral contraception in females
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.600]   can really exacerbate the factor V Leiden mutation.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:13.600]   Do you suggest that people get their factor V Leiden
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.440]   genetics analyzed?
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.160]   I mean, it's pretty inexpensive to do, right?
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.440]   I think on a standard blood test,
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.700]   you can just ask for the factor V analysis.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.840]   And it's not like a really in-depth thing.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.680]   You don't have to fly to some-
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.520]   - Yeah, it's a blood test.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.880]   - Yeah, you don't have to fly to another country,
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.840]   like you do for many things.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.560]   - It's important to say that's not the norm, right?
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.040]   Like that's not the recommendation.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.140]   When you're talking about putting somebody
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.640]   on the birth control pill,
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.480]   you want to make sure they don't have high blood pressure
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.080]   'cause it can increase their blood pressure.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.720]   You want to make sure they don't smoke cigarettes
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.640]   because the combination of the pill and cigarette smoking
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.560]   can increase the risk of a stroke.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.360]   But the recommendation is not to screen them
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.160]   to see if they have any inherited clotting disorders.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.560]   That said, if you ever have a blood clot
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.960]   on the birth control pill,
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.240]   'cause you're traveling on a plane
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.040]   or you're just on the pill or you're living your life,
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.180]   you're now gonna get this extensive workup
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.120]   to find out if you do have that.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:05.040]   It's by no means wrong, and specifically you should,
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.480]   if anybody in your family has ever had a DVT,
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.440]   so a deep vein thrombosis, so a blood clot in their leg,
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.800]   or a pulmonary embolism or a PE,
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.200]   so anybody in your family has had one of those,
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:19.740]   you should 100% get worked up for clotting disorders.
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:22.680]   And if you have something, like you carry Factor V,
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.880]   you should no longer take the birth control pill.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.960]   And specifically the pill, because it's an oral pill
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.320]   and how it's metabolized in the liver
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.840]   is actually what is causing the change
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:34.920]   in those clotting factors
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.840]   because that's where they're made as well.
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.960]   So it doesn't mean you can't take any form of contraception,
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.340]   but we do wanna make sure
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:44.040]   that we counsel you appropriately.
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.160]   I never think it's wrong to be an advocate
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.140]   for your own health or to ask questions.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.640]   It's important to know that screening,
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.880]   I mean, I'll get on my soapbox
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.680]   'cause we'll talk about screening for ovarian reserve
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.800]   and it is 100% not recommended,
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.340]   even though I think it should be.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:00.800]   - Yeah, my next question was gonna be
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.100]   about testing AMH levels,
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.960]   and we'll return to that for those that hear that
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.500]   and it sounds cryptic as well as getting an ultrasound,
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.660]   just seeing basically how many eggs
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:14.840]   are likely to be in the vault on both sides.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.380]   - Okay, so we have to remember
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.280]   that screening recommendations come
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.720]   from at what point in the population
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.880]   does it make sense to spend the money to test for a disease
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.020]   based on the likelihood of finding it.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.860]   So if we think about, right,
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.680]   that's what your pap smear guidelines
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.320]   and your colonoscopy and your mammograms,
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.820]   everything is all based on
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:38.180]   when are you going to find enough cases at some age
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.500]   to make it worthwhile testing,
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.060]   which is a crazy principle, especially in the US,
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:45.220]   because the government's not paying for our healthcare.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.660]   So why should these guidelines be based
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:50.600]   on when is it cost effective to do testing?
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.880]   - Well, I'll put in a,
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.820]   this is gonna sound a little bit conspiratorial,
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:54.660]   but it's not.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.940]   I mean, I think that given that
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:57.480]   for people who have insurance,
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.520]   private paid insurance or through their work,
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.260]   that there's a cost to doing these tests
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.800]   of any kind, colonoscopy, AMH, et cetera.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.920]   And they must have figured out the optimal point
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.960]   on the graph with which they can reduce their payout
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.440]   to people who, for instance, get colon cancer
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:17.060]   if they didn't get the colonoscopy at 45,
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:20.020]   as opposed to 50, as opposed to 60, as opposed to 25.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:23.060]   I mean, this is, I mean, the reality we know is that
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.100]   the more information you have,
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.540]   the better choices you can make.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:29.540]   I mean, the only caveat to that would be that for some,
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.240]   not all, but for some people,
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.780]   sort of the hypochondriatic type,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.820]   sometimes more information leads to more anxiety,
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:38.020]   which leads to more problems, but that's a rare instance.
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.860]   - I always think that in general, data is always good.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:42.700]   - I agree.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:45.340]   - Having the information at hand about your body
[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:47.660]   and being able to make educated choices
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:50.300]   versus being in a position where you say,
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:53.700]   "I had no idea that I had Factor V Leiden,
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.020]   and I had this terrible blood clot,"
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.300]   because pulmonary embolisms can kill people.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:23:59.400]   We all know that, right?
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.260]   So we talk about this rare thing, but it can happen.
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.460]   But this is really where it can be tough.
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:10.040]   It can be tough to find even a doctor who may,
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.580]   like we said, Factor V is a blood test
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.660]   and relatively inexpensive, so that one is not hard,
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.460]   but physicians live in a weird world
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.620]   where they have recommendations based on screening,
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.900]   based on the likelihood of finding disease that they follow,
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:25.680]   and when they go off of those,
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.280]   they start introducing themselves
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.100]   to why are you not following medical guidelines?
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.380]   But for an individual,
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.500]   this is really tough to advocate for yourself.
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.860]   And the one thing that I'll say too,
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.500]   this is why paying attention to your body is so important,
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.700]   right, understanding your stool habits
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.220]   and what's normal and what's not
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.860]   so that you can catch early signs of things
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:49.820]   and present for that colonoscopy earlier.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:51.820]   The current screening guideline
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.820]   for should you get your ovarian reserve checked
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.380]   is that you should not.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.920]   ACOG, the American College of OB/GYN,
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.820]   has an entire practice bulletin situation
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:06.000]   saying there's no utility in screening for AMH.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.200]   Okay, I totally disagree, but-
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.040]   - I'm glad you disagree.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.600]   I mean, to me, it just seems nuts, or ovaries, rather.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.640]   I mean, the AMH is a blood draw.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.760]   - AMH is a blood test. - It's a blood draw.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.600]   One could opt to do the ultrasound as well,
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.560]   which is, of course, more invasive.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.200]   But women who are seeing their OB/GYN
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:32.000]   are probably familiar with pelvic exams.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.820]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a vaginal ultrasound,
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.280]   but it's not painful.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.920]   - Not painful, but different than a blood draw,
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.780]   just for in full disclosure.
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:44.780]   So, and I've heard of women in their early 30s
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.960]   going in, getting their AMH levels checked,
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.300]   getting their ultrasound, and then going,
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.540]   "Oh my goodness, they're down to like,
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.720]   I don't want to throw out numbers
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.600]   'cause this actually can get tricky."
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.560]   They'll say, "Oh, you have whatever, four follicles."
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.720]   And then someone in their early 40s will have 20 follicles.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.560]   And then people start to,
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.400]   it sort of becomes a scorekeeping thing.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.740]   And of course, follicle quality,
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.280]   there are a bunch of other things.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.600]   And then you can tell us more about those.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.760]   But let's say someone did not have insurance
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.080]   or insurance permission to get this paid for.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.000]   What is the approximate cost
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.880]   of getting one's AMH levels analyzed?
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.200]   - $79.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.760]   - $79 to find out essentially
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.860]   where your ovarian reserve is at.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.800]   - So let's talk about this.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.760]   I already said this is my soapbox.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.960]   So ACOG says you shouldn't screen it
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:38.600]   because AMH does not predict your fecundability, right?
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.800]   Your body's ability to get pregnant in that month
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.200]   is independent of your AMH.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.040]   And for the most part, that's true, right?
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.760]   Because let's say you have a person
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.800]   and they're both 30, you have two people.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.360]   One has low ovarian reserves.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.480]   They have five eggs coming out of the vault.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.560]   And this one has normal ovarian reserve
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.160]   and they have 20 eggs coming out of the vault.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.040]   - And we should probably clarify that the number,
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:26:59.960]   'cause you said this earlier,
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.680]   but the number of eggs coming out of the vault
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.080]   is an indirect measure of how many eggs is in the vault.
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.500]   When that number is going down,
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.000]   it means the number of eggs in the vault
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.840]   is likely going down as well.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.260]   Sort of like your body starts to take smaller withdrawals
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.520]   as you start to run out.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:15.460]   - The vault wants to be at like equilibrium, right?
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.040]   It really wants to be in this middle ground.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:20.320]   So when you have too many, it shoots out more every month.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.360]   It's too crowded, it doesn't want that.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.120]   And then when it starts to get low,
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.600]   it gets scared about being empty
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.460]   and sends out fewer per month.
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.280]   So what you see outside the vault,
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.120]   and that is called an antral follicle count or an AFC.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.640]   It's an ultrasound-based measurement
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.240]   of how many eggs you have outside the vault
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.520]   at one point in time.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.620]   - And on the ultrasound, if one looks,
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:42.240]   this is gonna show up as sort of what looked like
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.560]   little hollow spaces, like so not gray stuff,
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.800]   but hollow bodies. - Yeah, I say chocolate chips
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.720]   and the chocolate chip cookie.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.720]   If we can imagine the ovary. - Beautiful image, yeah.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.240]   - Yeah, like looks like a chocolate chip cookie,
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.920]   the chocolate chips, small little dark fluid filled follicles
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.280]   each one of those houses an egg.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.160]   - Some bigger than others
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.360]   because they're more mature than others.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.880]   - Based on when you check in the cycle.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.640]   So if you're looking in that early follicular phase,
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.480]   when somebody is on their period,
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.960]   they all should be small because nothing's been stimulated.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.520]   If I'm looking periovulatory,
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.920]   I'll see that dominant follicle that's about to ovulate
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.560]   and then everything else will be small.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.280]   - And is there a graph that people can look at
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.880]   that we could link to that says, okay,
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.680]   the average with a distribution of standard error
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.920]   on either side for let's say a 28 year old woman
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.920]   or a 37 year old woman or a 45 year old woman
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.080]   of the number of follicles on the right and left side.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.120]   And as I understand, asymmetries are common,
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.780]   tends to be like if someone goes in
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.640]   and you got six follicles on the left side
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.760]   and 12 on the other side,
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.160]   how do people gauge where they're at?
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.680]   - Fantastic points.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.520]   One, because their doctor should tell them,
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.540]   but that doesn't always happen.
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:50.120]   But yes, we add these counts together
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:51.320]   to get your antral follicle count
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.620]   because there is often asymmetry.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:56.720]   But what we should expect, let's say in somebody who's 30,
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.380]   is you should have in the 16 to 20 range
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.920]   of total follicles per month.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.560]   - Right and left side combined.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:04.560]   - Combined, okay.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.020]   When you're 35, that number is closer to like 14 to 16.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.400]   So starting to drop, it's still pretty good.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.760]   When you're 40, it's eight to 10.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.640]   When you're 44, two to four, right?
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:19.020]   So you start to have this immense drop
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.760]   that exponentially starts to increase really around age 37.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:27.520]   So things start to kind of get into this severe zone
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.000]   really after age 37.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.200]   - And we didn't really talk about ages 18 to 25,
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.800]   but there are people who get pregnant in that age bracket.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.260]   Are, is the follicle count very, very high?
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.160]   Is there sort of a nonlinear drop off or?
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.480]   - Yeah, their follicle count will be higher.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.540]   And I mean, I occasionally have patients who are very young,
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.080]   but have infertility or want to freeze their eggs.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.880]   I also had patients in that age range
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:52.240]   who are in premature ovarian failure, right?
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.720]   Because there can be things that go wrong even early.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.160]   - But we should probably highlight again,
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.400]   something that you said earlier, but gosh, I, you know,
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.720]   this like contradicts so much of what's out there,
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.300]   which is that even if you have low follicle count,
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:07.280]   if you collect eggs, you're not changing what's in the vault.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.580]   You're not pulling from the vault.
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:09.420]   - You can't.
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:10.840]   - Right, those eggs are spent.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.880]   You now have the opportunity to turn them
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:13.840]   into potential pregnancies.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.440]   - Correct, I mean, side note, right?
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.280]   We haven't even dove into IVF,
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.720]   but that's the next wave of technology
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.820]   is what we call IVM and vitro maturation.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:24.120]   People are trying to figure out how can you get eggs
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.480]   from the vault and get them to grow in the lab?
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.440]   Because that would open up possibilities for people
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:33.280]   who have fewer eggs to have a higher efficiency
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:35.600]   of this process, because one of the limiting factors
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.720]   when you're doing fertility and you're doing egg freezing
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:41.680]   or IVF is how many eggs can you get per month?
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.520]   And that's why some people have to do cycle after cycle,
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.640]   because they can only get five eggs or five eggs.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:49.520]   But if we circle back to what we were saying
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.280]   when we got off on this beautiful tangent
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.640]   is that no matter if you have five or you have 20 eggs
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:56.040]   outside the vault, you're ovulating one.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.960]   So you're trying to get pregnant naturally.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.320]   That's what fecundability is,
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.200]   probability of getting pregnant per month, naturally.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:04.440]   You have the same chance if you're the same age,
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.520]   regardless of if you have five eggs or you have 20 eggs.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.600]   And that's why ACOG came in and said,
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.140]   well, AMH doesn't impact fecundability.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:15.420]   It doesn't predict your ability to get pregnant
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.800]   or who's gonna have infertility
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.780]   and who's not gonna have infertility.
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:23.780]   So there's no utility and screening for it in people now.
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:26.140]   - For once, I'm speechless.
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:29.160]   I mean, that argument makes sense through the lens
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.560]   of just probabilities of pregnancy
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.600]   through natural conception,
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:40.980]   but it completely erases the very, very, very real situation
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:44.620]   where people are making choices about, for instance,
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.020]   whether or not to stay with a given partner,
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.140]   whether or not to leave a given partner,
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.520]   whether or not to accelerate the process
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.820]   of building a family. - She raised my head.
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.240]   Should I have a baby now?
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.360]   These life choices. - There's so many factors
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.500]   that this American college of whoever, whoever
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.700]   is like completely psychologically divorced from.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.200]   - But they're crazy.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.480]   And that's what I say.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:03.220]   They argue in their statement
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:07.260]   that finding that you have, I'm like, I'm reeling it in.
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.600]   - I mean, I'm trying to think of an analogy
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.440]   that doesn't fail, but it's like if you can,
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:14.100]   it's like saying, okay, if you can walk now, great.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.960]   There's no reason to test for this inevitable paralysis
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.520]   that's going to happen at different rates
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.540]   in different people.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:21.880]   And there are things that you can do to offset it.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.820]   In other words, you could like take a little bit
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:26.780]   of some tissue that will allow you to walk in the future,
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:27.620]   but we're not gonna do that
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.880]   because if you can walk now, you can walk now.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.580]   - It's good now. - That's absurd.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:31.660]   - And that's really what it is.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:33.880]   And they say, well, finding out that you have low ovarian
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.420]   reserve at a young age is going to cause undue stress
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.880]   that is unwarranted because most people
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.780]   don't have infertility.
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:44.380]   And so they're purely putting it through the lens
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.780]   of your likelihood to get pregnant.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.060]   - But it's actionable stress.
[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:47.900]   - Exactly.
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:49.700]   - Like if it were just stress like, hey, guess what?
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.720]   And you know, I know people who have family members
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:55.000]   with Huntington's mutations and some opt to not know
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.420]   whether or not they themselves have the Huntington's
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.140]   mutation and it's a very personal choice, right?
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:04.920]   But here, whereas unfortunately there still isn't a cure
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.580]   for Huntington's, hopefully someday there will be,
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.860]   Malcolm would, but in the meantime,
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:11.500]   there is essentially a cure for this situation,
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.220]   which is the harvest and potential fertilization.
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.980]   - There's at least an opportunity.
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.540]   And this is what I say, and of course,
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:19.140]   you and I feel similarly.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.980]   Education and data, like being the one to make the choice
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:24.740]   is an extremely important distinction
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.700]   versus having it happen to you.
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.540]   So if you're young and you find out
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:30.380]   that you have low ovarian reserve,
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.020]   is that going to make a difference?
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.340]   And it very well might.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.940]   You might now freeze your eggs
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.600]   when you wouldn't have otherwise.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.900]   You might now start to try to get pregnant
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:41.620]   if you're partnered when you otherwise were just waiting,
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:42.460]   but now you know.
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.900]   - It might change the conversation with your partner too,
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:46.060]   right, because a lot of people think they can just wait
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:46.900]   because of age, right?
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:47.740]   We're in our 20s, we're in our 30s.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.100]   - No, I'm only 30, I can totally wait.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.200]   But if you have a low ovarian reserve,
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:54.420]   then you may lose the opportunity for parenthood.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.700]   And for a lot of people, this is a life goal.
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.740]   And this is what's wild to me.
[01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:01.060]   When on earth, besides reproduction,
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.160]   do we have life goals that we take the approach,
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.060]   I'll just wait and see if it's a problem later.
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.180]   Never, right?
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:12.340]   If you wanna become a doctor, you wanna become an athlete,
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:15.440]   you are constantly working towards that goal
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.700]   or understanding what it's going to take to get there.
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:21.180]   But why does the goal of parenthood,
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:23.140]   the attitude is completely,
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:25.780]   I'm not going to think about it until later,
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:28.540]   and then I'll deal with it if it becomes a problem.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.900]   Because you can make choices.
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:32.060]   You could freeze your eggs,
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.260]   you could try to get pregnant sooner,
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:37.720]   you could evaluate for reasons of low ovarian reserve.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.380]   Do you have a genetic mutation or an autoimmune disease?
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.780]   Why is it low?
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:44.140]   It's not just always a big unknown.
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.500]   There can be some actual things
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.120]   that potentially might be impactful
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.780]   for your health long term.
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:54.980]   So I think it's wild that this is the current conversation.
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:58.420]   And I will say, I know personally a lot of OBGYNs
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:02.340]   who 100% will draw an AMH blood task
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:04.720]   if you're at your annual and you ask.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.060]   And I recommend all of my OB friends,
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.860]   'cause I see people at a different stage, right?
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:12.300]   When they see me, they're struggling to get pregnant
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.860]   or they wanna freeze their eggs.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:16.620]   But when we talk about this, I say, hey,
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:19.660]   just like you say, are you trying to get pregnant now?
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:22.660]   And if somebody says no, and your follow-up question is,
[01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:24.640]   well, do you wanna be on birth control?
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.080]   The same question should be,
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.400]   well, do you wanna be pregnant at some point?
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:33.160]   And if so, should you consider freezing your eggs
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.900]   or getting this blood test checked?
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:38.180]   And very often people will make a different decision
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.220]   with that information.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.580]   - I'm so glad that you're highlighting this
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:42.560]   because my understanding is,
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.880]   at least in the state of California,
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.180]   I don't know about other states
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:47.060]   or if it even varies by state,
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:52.060]   that the opportunity to harvest eggs and freeze them,
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:58.860]   there's a hard cutoff at age, I think it is 42.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:01.580]   Prior to age 42, they'll do it.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:04.440]   After 42, they'll do it if and only if
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.400]   you're willing to do in vitro fertilization
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.700]   to actually fertilize and then they'll freeze embryos.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:12.140]   But they're far more reluctant to collect eggs after age 42.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.020]   - Yeah, yes and no.
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:16.660]   So when you think about egg freeze and an IVF
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.440]   are really the same process, right?
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.260]   When you're going through the exact same thing,
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:21.660]   you're taking the eggs out of the body
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.340]   and then you're either just freezing them as an egg
[01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.100]   or you're fertilizing them in the lab
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:30.020]   and that's IVF and making an embryo right away.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:34.140]   Egg freezing has changed dynamically over the past 10 years.
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:37.080]   Whereas 10 years ago, survival rate of eggs in the lab
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.900]   was 40%, really terrible.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:42.340]   And so we really didn't offer it to many people.
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.220]   It wasn't something that was talked about
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.480]   and now it feels trendy almost,
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.700]   but it's really just the tech has gotten so much better.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.540]   - And cheaper.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:52.540]   - Yeah, 90% of eggs now survive the freeze thaw.
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:56.780]   So 90% is not a low number by any means.
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.060]   Embryos are much stronger, right?
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.540]   An egg is a single cell.
[01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:01.940]   It's a single cell.
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:04.940]   An embryo, when we freeze an embryo that's day five or six
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.300]   is 300 plus cells.
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.980]   So it's so much stronger
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.540]   and those embryos survive the freeze thaw 99% of the time.
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:14.420]   So yes, there's a 9% difference.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:18.160]   That being said, making embryos is a lot more expensive.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.340]   Eggs is cheaper.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:21.020]   You could do two rounds of eggs
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:24.320]   and have just as many eggs or have more eggs
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.660]   than if you'd made them into embryos right away.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:30.420]   So I never recommend that somebody commits to a sperm source
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:32.660]   that they don't wanna have a child with
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:35.660]   unless that's the sperm source they wanna have a child.
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:39.140]   And this has changed because when embryo survival
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:41.940]   was so much greater than egg survival,
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.460]   especially if you had few eggs or you were older,
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:48.060]   making embryos was the only option.
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:51.340]   What we do know is that egg quality decreases immensely
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:52.180]   as we get older.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.020]   And we've touched on this,
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:55.100]   but we haven't really mentioned it.
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:59.040]   So not only do you have fewer eggs as you get older,
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.780]   the chromosomes inside start to lose their positioning.
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.100]   And so we think about egg quality,
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:05.960]   we think about genetic normalcy,
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.180]   and we know that the rates of aneuploidy
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:12.980]   or abnormal chromosomes increases proportionally to your age.
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:14.620]   - Which for people that aren't aware
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.780]   are going to predispose, not always,
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:20.140]   to miscarriages if they're implanted
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:24.200]   or potentially even the formation of a fetus
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.980]   that carries, for instance, trisomies,
[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:30.420]   so chromosomal repeats, or lack of certain chromosomes.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.420]   These could be deadly,
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:35.100]   or they could be capable of carrying to term,
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.620]   but have undetectable to mild
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:39.500]   to severe developmental abnormalities, correct?
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.060]   - Correct, and this is why you have a lower probability
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.060]   of pregnancy per month as you get older.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.340]   So if we look at your natural fecundability,
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:49.620]   it's not because you have fewer eggs,
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.140]   because we already said your egg count per month
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.900]   doesn't impact your probability of getting pregnant.
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.580]   It's because the normalcy of those chromosomes
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.340]   has changed so dramatically
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:01.740]   that the odds that your body's randomly choosing
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:05.100]   the good one to ovulate becomes so low,
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.940]   and that's why those natural fertility rates are so low,
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:10.520]   because most genetically abnormal eggs
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.460]   do not fertilize or implant.
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:15.300]   But if they do, they have a significantly higher
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:18.380]   chance of miscarriage, it's 40% at age 40, right?
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.500]   So you have a much lower chance
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.540]   of seeing the positive pregnancy test,
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.460]   but then your chance of losing that pregnancy
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:26.740]   is significantly higher as well.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:29.780]   So when we are counseling somebody about egg freezing,
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:32.740]   what we know is that not every egg
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:35.140]   is going to fertilize with sperm,
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:38.760]   going to make an embryo, going to be genetically normal,
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.800]   or even implant when it is genetically normal.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.700]   There is huge loss in human reproduction,
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:47.460]   meaning the more eggs you have at a younger age,
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:50.460]   the better the ROI on this process is gonna be.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:53.180]   It doesn't mean you don't do it when people get older,
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.820]   but every clinic does have a cutoff,
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.460]   and every clinic's gonna be a little bit different.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.200]   A lot of different reasons why.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.660]   We actually probably have an older cutoff,
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.100]   so we will let somebody go through IVF
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:06.380]   or freeze their eggs up to age 45,
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:08.660]   and it's a lot about informed consent
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.420]   and having the approach that you're smart enough,
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.660]   that if I give you the odds,
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.860]   and I walk you through how many eggs you are
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:18.420]   and the likelihood of them making into embryos,
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:22.220]   you can say, yeah, but four eggs or 10 eggs
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:25.740]   is way more than zero based on my circumstance,
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:27.760]   and that is worth it to me
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.660]   because it gives me the opportunity
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.080]   to potentially have a child
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.700]   when otherwise my opportunity is going to be zero.
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:38.180]   So a lot of this is rooted in paternalism
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:41.820]   that people can't, as a patient, understand these odds,
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:45.060]   and they have unrealistic expectations.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.060]   I think there's a huge shift in reproductive medicine
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:48.580]   to really counseling patients
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:52.100]   and giving them autonomy in some of these decisions,
[01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:53.420]   but there does become a point
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:56.820]   where the likelihood of finding a normal egg
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.620]   is so, so low that the money
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:01.540]   or the expense of the process doesn't make sense,
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:04.700]   and people should utilize egg donation
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.300]   or other opportunities for conception.
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:11.240]   This drop in both the number of eggs and the egg quality,
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.240]   they really start to become so profound at age 37 and on,
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.460]   and that's when we really start to see
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:19.460]   both these things are overlapping at the same time.
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:24.460]   So if you're waiting till age 35, 36 for your first kid,
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:27.560]   but you want two or three,
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560]   we've got to really look forward about
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.580]   is that strategy make sense?
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:34.420]   Well, what is your AMH?
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:36.820]   One, are you gonna run out of eggs before then?
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.220]   Two, what other issues could be going on?
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.340]   Is the sperm fine? Are the tubes open?
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:46.500]   Because we are seeing that when people start families later,
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.320]   when people have more chronic illness
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.480]   and autoimmune disease and obesity,
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.480]   that it's much harder to get pregnant.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.260]   And so the birth rates are for the first time
[01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:57.820]   in a long time across the border dropping,
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.200]   and infertility is rising
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.920]   because of all of these factors combined.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.200]   - So based on everything you just said,
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.580]   and yes, I'm gonna say it a fifth time
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:09.100]   because the misconception about this
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:10.820]   is one of the primary reasons
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:13.540]   why people avoid harvesting eggs.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:14.700]   It's not the only reason,
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.600]   but when you harvest eggs, freeze them.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.460]   Now it sounds like the viability of those eggs
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:22.100]   is quite strong compared to a few years ago.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:26.380]   So that's great, 90% recovery when they thaw them
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:30.420]   is not going to diminish the number of eggs in the vault,
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:32.200]   such a critical point.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:37.520]   And post age 37, there's a,
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.480]   sounds like a non-linear drop-off in egg quality for most,
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.600]   and these are averages.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.080]   - Of course, always gonna be exceptions.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.920]   - So the people that got pregnant with healthy kids
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:48.460]   in their late 30s and 40s, yes, we hear you.
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:51.480]   Congratulations, we're happy.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:56.480]   But this speaks to the logic anyway,
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.920]   we're not putting any emotion or circumstances on this,
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.360]   but the logic of somebody in their,
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.760]   let's say late 20s, early 30s,
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.440]   getting their AMH levels through a roughly $80 blood draw.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:13.260]   And then perhaps based on their life goals and circumstances,
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:15.300]   doing either one or several rounds
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.500]   of egg collection and freezing,
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.540]   especially since it sounds like you don't need
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:20.740]   to fertilize those eggs.
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:22.460]   So if one doesn't have a partner
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.740]   is concerned about what they're going to do,
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:28.380]   who's going to be, who's going to provide the sperm,
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:30.380]   'cause of course some people choose
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.100]   to raise kids on their own,
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.960]   but parenting is a whole other issue,
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.860]   but they could do that later.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:41.860]   So that raises the questions of what are the health risks,
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:45.900]   if any pain levels, if any,
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:50.180]   and that includes psychological pain of egg harvest.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.840]   I mean, so going back to what you said earlier,
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:54.540]   this is going to be injecting synthetic mimics
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:58.200]   of FSH and LH, follicle stimulating hormone
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:00.520]   and luteinizing hormone, maybe some growth hormone.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.580]   I hear nowadays, there's also the practice of injecting,
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:08.760]   these are essentially platelet rich plasma, PRP,
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.720]   platelet rich plasma, excuse me, PRP,
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.480]   perhaps even into the ovarian vault,
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.640]   we can get back to that.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.260]   So there's a bunch of stuff that's being done to someone.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.400]   There's low stim where people are getting
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:21.180]   like low doses of these drugs.
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:23.900]   There's high stim where it's like a full blast.
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.360]   Maybe you could walk us through that procedure
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.660]   and just sort of general contour,
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.280]   'cause it would require a lot of time
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.560]   to go through it all in detail,
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.360]   but is this a horrible thing to go through?
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.960]   Is it mild to go through?
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.420]   Is it like a walk in the park?
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:36.680]   - Let's walk through it all.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:39.400]   So I love this, and this is my bread and butter,
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.120]   and this is what I do every day.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.960]   Studies tell us that if you are not ready to have a family
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.200]   by age 32 to 33, that that is the optimal time
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:49.660]   for the average person to intervene and freeze their eggs.
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.640]   It's not up for debate.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.760]   It's when you have both the intersection
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:57.500]   of still a good egg quality and good egg quantity on average.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.220]   And so that is younger than a lot of people
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.180]   are thinking about having families.
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:04.180]   And the reason why is when we really think
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.860]   about what happens to the egg afterward,
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:08.820]   that's what's really critically important.
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:10.860]   So I'm gonna answer the question about what you go through,
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.460]   but just thinking, we already said you freeze your eggs,
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:16.100]   90% of them are gonna survive the freeze-thaw.
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.020]   About 75% will be fertilized by sperm,
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:21.420]   and about 50% of those will even make it
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:23.900]   to an implantation stage embryo or a blastocyst.
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.060]   - And we're assuming healthy sperm.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:29.380]   So sperm, no DNA, excessive DNA fragmentations.
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:30.380]   - You've already hit the nail on the head.
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:32.900]   One of the biggest issues with egg freezing
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:35.540]   is I don't know the future.
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:39.560]   I don't know if this sperm is going to be great or not.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.400]   I don't know-
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.220]   - It could be from a pot smoker.
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.060]   Just kidding, pot smokers.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:44.080]   - Not kidding, pot smokers or not.
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:45.020]   But we don't know, right?
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:47.020]   So we have this future yet undetermined sperm source.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:49.720]   So I am going to assume you're gonna fall average
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:52.020]   on these data points that we're gonna walk through.
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:55.300]   But the reality is you buffer the risk by having more eggs
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:57.300]   frozen, and that's why people are going through
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:00.200]   multiple rounds or cycles, because we don't know.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.420]   We don't know how that fertilization will be.
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:05.780]   If you have 20 eggs, and 18 survive the freeze-thaw,
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:09.940]   and 14 fertilize, and seven make it to the blastocyst stage.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:14.940]   If you're age 30, we would anticipate around 60 to 70%
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:16.740]   of them are gonna be genetically normal.
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:19.020]   And you're young, so that's already kind of a big hit
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:20.020]   at that age.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:23.040]   So let's say of the seven, four of them
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.900]   are genetically normal.
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:28.380]   When I go to transfer them, I have at best a 65% chance
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:31.660]   of live birth per embryo, which is really good
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.380]   when you put in the lens of fecundability,
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.100]   and peak success tends to be closer to 20%.
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:37.820]   - And you're gonna implant one embryo at a time?
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:39.860]   - 100%, we're gonna implant one embryo at a time now.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.100]   - Does anyone ask for two?
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.620]   - People ask for two, doctors will do two.
[01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:46.420]   It is, it lowers live birth rates.
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:50.460]   If we're looking at giving each embryo the healthiest
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.160]   opportunity at becoming a baby, number one,
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:56.160]   embryos with IVF have a slightly higher chance
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.180]   of monozygotic twinning, right, so twinning,
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:02.100]   fraternal twinning comes if you ovulate two eggs,
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:05.400]   they both get fertilized, so each baby is completely
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.980]   different genetically, own egg, own sperm.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.660]   Monozygotic is from an embryo split.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:15.100]   Because of the IVF process, likely putting the embryo
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:20.100]   in the catheter, maybe having that outer surface touched,
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.980]   predisposes it to splitting after you put it into the body.
[01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:25.220]   - So more identical twins, monozygotic.
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:27.540]   - Yeah, we have a two to 3% chance of monozygotic twins
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:30.540]   with IVF, and the natural chance is .03%.
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:34.040]   So significantly higher, even though ultimately
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:37.300]   not a probable outcome, I'm gonna have a couple patients
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:40.500]   a year who are going to have monozygotic twins.
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:43.640]   And if I put two embryos in, I've now one,
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.900]   taken this from a potential twin pregnancy
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:50.460]   to a triplet or even a quad if they both split.
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.280]   - So hence, presumably, like the Octomom cases
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.120]   and things like that.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.860]   - Well, that one, they just literally put eight embryos
[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:57.380]   inside, but that's a whole, I mean,
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:59.140]   that's medical malpractice, right?
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.740]   But really, most of the time, when we're talking
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:03.820]   about embryos, we're talking about people with infertility
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:06.060]   or people who've spent a significant amount of money,
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:09.700]   a huge portion of fertility is embryo quality, right?
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:12.140]   The competency of the embryo, the genetics of the embryo,
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.060]   it's expensive to go through egg freezing and IVF,
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:18.140]   yet the uterine environment is another component.
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.800]   It doesn't make sense to waste multiple embryos
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.120]   in the same uterine environment.
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:23.980]   Statistically, it doesn't make sense.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.740]   It also doesn't make sense to make your embryos
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:26.920]   compete against each other.
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.620]   - So will people put one embryo into,
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:34.620]   let's just say DNA mom, right, and one into surrogate mom?
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:38.120]   And try and get two siblings simultaneously?
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.020]   - I've definitely done that and had patients do that.
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:44.760]   It's not common because surrogacy using a gestational carrier
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.180]   is so expensive and there's such limited supply,
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:51.560]   it's very hard to find somebody who wants to go through
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:54.640]   the act of carrying a child for somebody else,
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.580]   but that definitely is a strategy that some people utilize,
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:59.980]   especially if they're older or they're concerned
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:02.700]   that they might have a lower chance of implantation,
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:04.980]   but they wanna give themselves a try.
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:09.740]   But if we look at one embryo, 65% chance of success.
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:14.260]   Cumulative probability after the second is 88%, okay?
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:16.980]   Almost everybody's pregnant after two,
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:21.260]   and these are euploid genetically normal embryos, okay?
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.360]   And then if you go to the third,
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.580]   so cumulatively after three euploid embryo transfers,
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:28.100]   each one being a single embryo,
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:31.480]   95% of people have a baby in their arms,
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.360]   meaning the incidence of recurrent implantation failure
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.780]   is actually pretty low, 5%.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:41.340]   But how many normal embryos do you need
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:43.980]   for what family size if you're freezing your eggs?
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:47.220]   Because you got 20 eggs at age 30 in the example I gave
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:50.020]   and you just made four normal embryos, right?
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:53.880]   So that's really unlikely to make three or four kids.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:57.060]   It would, it has a really good chance of making one,
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.260]   gives you the opportunity for a second,
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:02.220]   but that's also presuming that everything happened perfectly,
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:05.220]   that the sperm is not pot smoking sperm,
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:06.900]   but you know what I mean, not bad quality sperm,
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.000]   there's not other environmental issues
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.780]   when it comes to your own health
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:12.060]   when you're trying to get pregnant
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:14.320]   or other diseases you may have.
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.100]   So we really need a higher number of eggs,
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:20.040]   specifically when we don't know what the equation
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.780]   will truly look like for one individual person
[01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:24.380]   when they go through the process.
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:28.440]   And one of the only added benefits of embryos,
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.940]   especially if you are partnered,
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:33.180]   if you're with somebody who you do wanna have children with,
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:35.200]   you just don't wanna have them yet,
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:38.360]   is that I know the downstream, I know the number,
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.740]   I know how many embryos I have,
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:44.020]   and if it's not enough to give you a high chance
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.840]   of what you want your family to be,
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.840]   you can intervene now, right?
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:50.260]   Because by definition with egg freezing,
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:53.540]   we're not wanting to be pregnant for years.
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:55.380]   So if you're doing this with a partner
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:56.740]   and you're making embryos,
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:00.700]   and now I say we only got one genetically normal embryo,
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.300]   you have the opportunity to choose
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:05.620]   to either go through more cycles
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:08.320]   and store more embryos for later
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.660]   to maybe try to get pregnant sooner
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:13.280]   because there's some underlying issue with your fertility.
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.020]   You can make a choice
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.140]   because you're falling off the curve there.
[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:18.200]   - Could I ask you a question?
[01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:21.340]   So you mentioned age about 32 to 33.
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:24.900]   In an ideal circumstance with the finances there, et cetera,
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:26.460]   one would harvest eggs,
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:28.460]   unless they're already starting a family
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:30.300]   through natural means.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:31.620]   What about for sperm?
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.420]   I mean, we've all heard the studies
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:37.240]   that with increased age of the sperm,
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:38.620]   that there's a higher,
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:40.540]   although still statistically pretty small,
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.180]   incidence of things like spectrum conditions.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:49.180]   So do you recommend to younger males,
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:54.200]   men in their late 20s, early 30s, to free sperm?
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:56.360]   - I mean, it's never gonna be wrong to save your gametes
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.660]   because we don't have crystal balls for the future, right?
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.920]   So your gametes are your eggs and your sperm.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.540]   That increase in, we'll just say, negative outcome
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:06.260]   from advanced paternal age
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:08.620]   really starts to be seen at age 50.
[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:10.620]   So most men are not looking at
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:14.160]   primarily starting their family after that age.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:17.100]   However, what I run into all the time is
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:19.960]   maybe you're working on a second family
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:22.420]   or maybe life has gone down a different pathway
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:25.260]   and now you're with a partner who potentially is younger
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:28.180]   and wants to conceive and you now have older sperm.
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:29.180]   Having sperm in the bank,
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.620]   it's so cheap and easy to free sperm.
[01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:33.720]   Eggs, I haven't even answered your primary question.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:35.800]   - And the process of collecting sperm,
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:40.120]   while not entirely without its issues, is far simpler.
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.980]   - It's embarrassing at best, but it's much simpler.
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.820]   - Yeah, it's much simpler.
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:46.560]   It generally doesn't require hormone injections,
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.200]   although maybe for rare instances
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:50.300]   where people are hypogonadal or something.
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.540]   - If you're gonna freeze your sperm, you're right.
[01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:54.680]   Typically, you're going to get some blood work done
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:58.240]   because most places that store sperm per FDA guidelines
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.700]   have to make sure that if you carried an infectious disease,
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.900]   it's stored in a special tank.
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:03.500]   So you'll have to get blood work done,
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.780]   then you'll have to abstain for your two to three days,
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.980]   collect into a cup, you're done.
[01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:09.420]   - Which, by the way, guys, you can do at home
[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:10.260]   and bring it in.
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.340]   Sperm are so stable.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:12.780]   If you've ever done this, you just bring it in.
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:13.600]   It's pretty-
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:14.440]   - Just carry it in a little bag.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:17.100]   - A little bit of, I think I'm not gonna feign
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:18.900]   that my friend did this and told me,
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:22.260]   but it's kind of outrageously easy
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:24.380]   in the sense that you just bring it in
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:26.100]   and they'll take it out in the lobby and be like,
[01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:26.940]   is that your name?
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:29.520]   Like very different than the egg collection procedure.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:31.200]   - So here's what I'll say about sperm
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:34.920]   and what I wish more men knew/more men did.
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:36.360]   If you're going to get a vasectomy
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:39.480]   because you are choosing that you don't want to have kids,
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:41.500]   and we see many men who do this,
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.120]   they say they don't want to have kids,
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:44.880]   they want to go get a vasectomy,
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.480]   yet later on in life, you don't have a crystal ball
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:50.180]   about life is dynamic and things can change.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:52.260]   If you're going to get a vasectomy, go free sperm first.
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.580]   - Why are so many men getting vasectomies?
[01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:56.320]   - I don't have the answer to that.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.440]   - I hadn't heard this.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:59.800]   - Yeah, a lot of men are getting vasectomies,
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.840]   even I think to just take control
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.820]   over not having a child out there when they don't want to, so.
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:08.240]   - Maybe this explains the drop in birth rates.
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.240]   I'm just kidding, it's multifactorial.
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:12.640]   - But so many people, even if you're in your family,
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.880]   let's say you have two kids and y'all decided
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:16.300]   you're going to get the vasectomy
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:18.400]   so that you don't have any more children,
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:23.220]   things happen, terrible things happen and life changes.
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:27.620]   There might be a circumstance where you potentially
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:30.460]   would have another kid if something really bad happened
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.260]   or you just changed your mind.
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:35.820]   Freezing sperm is so easy and so much easier
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:39.180]   than if you don't, not all vasectomy reversals work,
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:41.320]   especially the longer that it's been reversed,
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:44.060]   the lower the likelihood that it's actually going to work.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.340]   And very often if it does, you don't get sperm
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.460]   in sufficient levels for a timed intercourse
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:50.180]   and you're seeing me in the office.
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:52.140]   - And freezing sperm is cheap.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:53.320]   I mean, it's relatively cheap.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:55.180]   - It's like $400, right?
[01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:57.700]   So it's much, much cheaper all in
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:00.020]   than the entire egg freezing process.
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.700]   So to answer the original question,
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.420]   when you go through egg freezing,
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:06.140]   most people do fantastic.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:09.300]   And we'll just use egg freezing and IVF interchangeably here
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:12.020]   because what you as a person is going through
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.720]   to harvest your eggs or to take them out of your body
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:16.460]   is exactly the same, right?
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.940]   The distinction between egg freezing and IVF
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.220]   is all about what happens on the lab end of it
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:23.220]   after they've come out of your body.
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:25.980]   So if we have this group of eggs that comes out of the vault,
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:28.700]   your body doesn't want to allow them all to grow,
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:30.140]   even if it's a low number, right?
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:33.260]   That's the check and balance to not have so many kids.
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.300]   So we need to override that process.
[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:37.100]   And what we tend to do with this
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:40.460]   is to use a combination of hormonal medications.
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:42.700]   And very often I describe it to patients
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:45.780]   as suppressing your body and then stimulating it.
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:50.140]   So if I can temporarily stop the production of FSH
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:52.460]   and you have a group of eggs come out of the vault,
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:55.220]   and we can imagine that FSH is their food,
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:56.340]   and there is no food
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:56:00.060]   because you're taking the birth control pill for three weeks.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.960]   These eggs are going to synchronize,
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:04.140]   be very small, be very hungry.
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.100]   For lack of a better word,
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.220]   their FSH receptors are gonna open all up.
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:10.100]   It's like a nest of baby birds that are all now starving
[01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:12.500]   instead of the hungry bird gets the worm.
[01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:16.860]   So now we go with the suppression period for a few weeks.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:19.660]   We can come in and give gonadotropins,
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:21.660]   which is FSH and LH.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.020]   FSH is now synthetically made in a lab.
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:25.300]   It's very easy.
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:27.180]   It's a synthetic compound that mimics the structure
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:29.120]   of the brain FSH.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.780]   We actually can't synthetically make LH, very interesting.
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:34.540]   We don't have a way to make it yet.
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:39.020]   And so we use the purified urine of menopausal women
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:41.040]   because when you're in menopause,
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.180]   your FSH and LH levels are naturally so high
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:48.420]   because they're trying to get that egg to make some estrogen.
[01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:51.100]   - So here are some that,
[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:53.800]   we've covered male hormone health before,
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.740]   and there's been a discussion of HCG,
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:58.060]   human chorionic gonadotropin,
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.060]   which is essentially mimics LH.
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:01.580]   - In the receptor, it does, yes.
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:06.480]   - All right, so is pregnant human chorionic gonadotropin,
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:10.160]   is it purified from post-menopausal women's urine?
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:12.060]   - No. - Or is it synthetic?
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:13.320]   - HCG is synthetic.
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.540]   - And so why can't-
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:16.260]   - Well, I'm talking about, it's called Minipure.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:17.900]   - Minipure. - Minipure is a combination
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:19.700]   of FSH and LH.
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:22.700]   The reason why we give HCG to men
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.420]   to try to stimulate the spermatogenesis process,
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:28.060]   which of course, if we could just give LH, we'd give LH,
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:30.740]   it's the same reason why we give HCG for a trigger.
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:33.060]   If we are going to go through fertility treatments
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:35.200]   and we're trying to mimic that LH surge,
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.420]   which naturally would cause ovulation,
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:41.740]   we actually are giving HCG because it does mimic LH
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:43.960]   when it comes to the receptor action of it.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:48.120]   But when it comes to really, especially in getting
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:50.520]   follicular development and the relationship
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:55.160]   between LH and FSH, meaning LH is really providing
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.340]   some of the hormone substrate that we need
[01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:59.320]   to be able to make estrogen.
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:03.580]   And so you really need some LH in a lot of people,
[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:05.800]   depending on your protocol or if you're older
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.520]   and you're naturally making less.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:12.520]   The example or the offshoot would be like the PCOS patient
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:14.580]   who has some naturally high LH.
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:18.200]   Sometimes they don't actually need LH in their protocol.
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:20.080]   - But who are these postmenopausal women
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.320]   that are supplying their urine?
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.960]   They're paid? - I don't know, right?
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:25.380]   - Yeah, I swear, I imagine them on some island someplace.
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:26.660]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:27.500]   - Go to the menopause.
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.680]   - Getting paid to urinate.
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:29.700]   - And it's called Menopure,
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:32.500]   like it's purified menopausal urine, right?
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:33.340]   It's wild. - I did not know that.
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:34.640]   - Most people don't know that.
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.480]   - They know now.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.300]   - Now they know.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:40.060]   And so we use FSH and LH, we'll just say,
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:40.980]   in lack of better terms,
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:43.920]   those are the two primary compounds that we're giving
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.360]   over the course of, on average, a 12-day period
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:51.500]   to get the follicles to grow and the eggs to mature.
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:55.740]   So you can measure egg maturity by blood levels of estradiol
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:57.200]   and by transvaginal ultrasounds.
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.940]   So when you're going through egg freezing or IVF,
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:04.060]   you're taking these hormone shots of FSH and LH,
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:07.260]   and they are getting those follicles to start to grow,
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.300]   the eggs are starting to mature,
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:11.420]   we are monitoring them along the way,
[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:14.180]   trying to determine the time period where we think
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:17.980]   most of the eggs will be in the mature range.
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:20.220]   These eggs have gotten to maturity.
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:22.480]   You then are going to take a trigger shot,
[01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:25.100]   which allows that final stage of meiosis
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.140]   so those chromosomes can separate, right?
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.620]   We think about the egg,
[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:33.020]   we remember that normal female genetics, it's 46XX,
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:35.100]   and I always think about, in the egg,
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:36.740]   that these chromosomes are lined up.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:40.200]   Your eggs are frozen inside your body.
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.900]   When you're born, your eggs are in metaphase of meiosis.
[01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:46.140]   So that's when metaphase chromosomes meet in the middle
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.480]   and they're held apart by these meiotic spindles.
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:51.140]   And this is why eggs are so stinkin' fragile,
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:52.500]   because they're held like this,
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.340]   and those meiotic spindles just absorb
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:56.740]   the wear and tear of your life,
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:58.860]   but when you use that trigger shot,
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:02.780]   that LH surge naturally or that HCG in a cycle,
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:05.300]   that's when you're gonna get that final separation
[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:08.420]   into half those chromosomes into the egg.
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:12.020]   - So for people listening, think about like a zipper.
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:12.860]   - Oh, I love that.
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:14.460]   - And you're pulling apart of a zipper
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:17.900]   that then you now have the chromosomes,
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:21.300]   just one, you now have halved the chromosomes, because why?
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:23.140]   Because in successful fertilization,
[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:25.620]   the other chromosomes are gonna come from sperm.
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:29.580]   - The sperm, and that's why this process has more error
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:30.660]   the older you are,
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:33.440]   and the longer your chromosomes have been sitting there,
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:36.000]   because those spindles are going to break down,
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.260]   and we're gonna have that increase in aneuploidy,
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:41.860]   like we already said, purely because of this impact.
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:43.660]   - Can I ask a question about that specifically?
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.040]   I think now would be the right time to ask,
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.760]   which is that my understanding is that a lot of the dynamics
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.420]   of pulling apart of this zipper-like thing,
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:53.940]   these chromosomes, and then is related to mitochondrial DNA,
[02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:54.840]   because there are a lot of mechanics.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:58.140]   We're literally talking about an egg splitting itself
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:00:58.980]   in half. - Yeah, the mitochondria
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:00:59.800]   is its powerhouse.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:01.140]   - Yeah, and the mitochondria.
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:03.900]   And so mitochondrial health is a big topic these days,
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:06.040]   and so we will be sure to touch on nutrition,
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.520]   supplementation, and prescription drugs
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:09.060]   that impact mitochondrial health.
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:13.420]   But I've heard of a new procedure called three-parent IVF,
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:16.400]   where they're taking basically the DNA
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:21.400]   from the intended mom, the DNA from intended dad,
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:28.060]   and then putting it into a surrogate, like a donor egg,
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:31.420]   that is where the DNA has been sucked out,
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:36.420]   and then because it has healthier, younger mitochondrial DNA.
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:40.260]   So you're essentially, let's say you've got a couple
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:42.740]   in there, like let's say late 30s, early 40s,
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:44.740]   and they're not getting successful embryos
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:47.280]   or implantations or whatever, things aren't working.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:48.840]   They'll take the DNA from mom and dad,
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:53.840]   and they'll merge it with a third parent encapsulation.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.060]   There are clinics that do this.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:57.140]   I know that a lot of this was actually being done
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:59.980]   in Eastern Europe until recently.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:03.300]   Mexico offers, there are places in Mexico that do this.
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:06.540]   In England, it's been used to solve
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:08.820]   mitochondrial dysfunction, but in the US,
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:11.180]   this is still not legal, is that right?
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:13.660]   - Yes, so the purpose of what you're talking about,
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:16.500]   essentially, when we think about utilizing
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:20.740]   a donor mitochondrial or a donor egg,
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:23.700]   the point of that technology existed
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:26.660]   to help cure mitochondrial diseases,
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:28.780]   which are 100% fatal.
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:31.980]   And so you would have this subset of people who would,
[02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:35.060]   because if you're the mom, you always pass on
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:39.560]   your mitochondria to all of the offspring.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.940]   So if there's disease inherent in your mitochondria,
[02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:43.460]   everybody's going to get it.
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:46.020]   And these are very severe diseases.
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:48.620]   So the idea of this was first to say,
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:51.740]   hey, can we overcome this mitochondria disease
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.220]   and give people the opportunity?
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:55.980]   Which it has done that, right?
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.820]   Now--
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:58.300]   - So it works when done properly.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:00.540]   - When done properly, especially for that purpose.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.800]   Now that purpose is distinct because
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.300]   those people aren't infertile, right?
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:08.660]   There's something else going on
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:10.780]   within their mitochondrial disease.
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:13.380]   Utilizing that technology to overcome
[02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:15.260]   age-related changes in the eggs
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:17.500]   has not been successful yet.
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:18.980]   Are we hopeful that it can?
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:21.760]   Will people charge you money for it in certain places?
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:25.340]   Yes, but you're hitting on a really important topic,
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:30.340]   is that the political environment of embryo research
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:34.580]   in the United States makes it extremely hard for us
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:38.560]   to be the pioneers of new technology in this space.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:43.180]   And that is because a lot of views about an embryo
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:46.840]   or when does life begin that happens here in the US,
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:49.180]   that results in limiting the availability
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:52.420]   and the possibility of doing research
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:54.900]   in a meaningful way on human embryos.
[02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:55.820]   - Right, 'cause it would require
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:57.740]   the destruction of a lot of,
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:04:01.500]   and it would also, and I looked into this a little bit
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:04.620]   from an academic perspective to be clear,
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:09.140]   it would also require that the abortions
[02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:10.940]   be performed differently because suction abortions
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:14.020]   destroy embryos in ways that extraction abortions don't.
[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:15.660]   So this is a very controversial topic.
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:18.300]   I mean, it's something that maybe we'll return to
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:20.380]   in an episode about stem cells in the future.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.380]   - Yeah, it's fascinating because,
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:25.420]   especially if you look at IVF, a whole separate issue
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:27.160]   is that there's millions of embryos
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.580]   that people are no longer using
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:32.620]   because they have had success,
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:34.260]   they had extra embryos in the bank,
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:37.160]   they got divorced, a variety of reasons.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:40.820]   And a lot of people would like to donate their embryos
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:43.180]   to science, feel like, hey,
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:46.580]   I don't wanna have this embryo implanted,
[02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:48.440]   I don't wanna carry this child,
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.940]   but potentially could something good
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:52.540]   or could it help advance the field?
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:54.980]   But that's not really a tangible option.
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:57.100]   When people do that, what is actually happening
[02:04:57.100 --> 02:05:01.060]   is their embryos are being utilized to train embryologists,
[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:02.500]   which is valid, right?
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:05.860]   To teach them how to thaw and freeze and biopsy
[02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:08.100]   and do different things, so it's still useful,
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:11.440]   but it's not in a meaningful way like we'd really love
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:14.140]   to be able to utilize to advance the science,
[02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:17.260]   especially for these embryos that have been created,
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:21.460]   yet people no longer need them for family growth.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:23.940]   - So what happens to all the embryos that people don't use?
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:26.620]   - It's a fantastic question, right now they sit in storage.
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:27.460]   This is-- - Forever?
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:28.740]   - Well, this is a new problem, okay?
[02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:32.860]   IVF is only 40-ish years old, embryo freezing alone, right?
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:34.900]   The first IVF, we haven't even gone through
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:37.620]   the whole process, but the first IVF baby,
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:41.260]   there's no FSHLH to stimulate more of the eggs
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:42.260]   outside the vault to grow,
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:44.460]   so they followed the single follicle
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:46.300]   and they didn't have the procedure,
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:49.040]   which we do now, which is a minimally invasive procedure
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:50.060]   to extract eggs.
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:54.160]   We go vaginally with a needle attached to the ultrasound
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:57.420]   and we enter into each follicle and we drain it.
[02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:59.940]   The very first IVF, you followed one follicle
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:02.620]   and you went in abdominally with a surgery
[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:05.420]   to put that needle into the follicle and drain it out
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:07.380]   and give that just one egg a chance.
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:10.320]   And then of course, there was no embryo freezing originally,
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:14.400]   so the field is still rather young to understand
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:18.480]   some of this and as technology rapidly improves,
[02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:20.900]   we see things like better success rates
[02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:23.140]   with freezing and thawing embryos,
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:26.100]   better process of getting more embryos to grow,
[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.760]   but now we have a lot of embryos in storage
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:31.080]   that may or may not be used.
[02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:35.580]   I personally tell people, you should keep your embryos,
[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:40.200]   you should pay the storage fee until no matter what,
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:42.880]   the worst thing on planet Earth happens to you,
[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:44.460]   you're done having children.
[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:47.220]   Because sadly, I live in a spectrum with my field
[02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:48.740]   where I see a lot of sadness
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:50.880]   and people who maybe have lost a child,
[02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:54.180]   something else has happened and they have maybe a sibling
[02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:56.840]   who they feel like they really wanna give this sibling child
[02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:59.580]   the chance to be a sibling again
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:03.180]   and often you're much older when you're experiencing this
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:06.140]   and if you had had embryos frozen that you could have used
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:09.100]   but you got rid of them, you're gonna be really upset
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.560]   if you find yourself in that circumstance.
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:13.880]   So I always say you should save them until you know
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:16.020]   that you are not going to need them
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:18.200]   and then what do you do with them?
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:20.020]   Most people just discard them,
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:21.740]   some people will donate them to labs
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:23.620]   which is called for research
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:26.760]   but mostly it's for embryologist training.
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:27.600]   - To get better at doing IVF.
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:30.060]   - To get better, which is also important.
[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.780]   But embryo donation's a new thing.
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:35.700]   So being able to, just like we have people who donate sperm
[02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:40.500]   and donate eggs, embryo donation is the next evolution
[02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:44.540]   of an opportunity to allow more people to become parents.
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:46.780]   It's a little bit of the wild west,
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:51.680]   people finding people in Facebook groups and connecting,
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:54.360]   it's this whole other dynamic when it comes to
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:57.260]   what we call third party reproduction
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:08:01.800]   or what do you do with known donors and things like that
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:04.160]   but it's a very interesting concept.
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:06.860]   So this problem is emerging
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.980]   as the technology is getting better.
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:13.460]   I'm realizing now, remembering rather,
[02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:16.220]   that when I was in college and graduate school
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:19.020]   you would see these ads in the student paper
[02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:21.660]   for egg donors and sperm donors.
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:25.020]   Sperm are generated throughout the lifespan
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:27.340]   so that's a kind of less controversial issue
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:30.180]   but this has now not allowed most places
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:32.900]   to advertise for egg donors on college campuses.
[02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:34.760]   That's my understanding.
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:39.440]   The egg donors were often paid whatever they were paid.
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.400]   I'm not going to say it was reasonable amounts or not
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:43.440]   'cause I don't recall what they were paid
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.280]   and everyone's circumstances are different.
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:49.840]   But the argument that most people use against this is,
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:51.840]   oh well these people are giving up eggs
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:53.000]   that they could otherwise use
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.040]   but we now know that's not true.
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:00.040]   So do you have any knowledge as to what was the rationale
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.360]   for limiting the recruitment of egg donors?
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.860]   Anyway, I'm not arguing for or against.
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:11.000]   I just, it's no longer supported based on what you said
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.840]   by the argument that they're losing eggs
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:17.000]   they would otherwise be able to keep.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.560]   - Some of it's about proper informed consent,
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.560]   especially at an age where the financial incentive
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:27.980]   can be very persuasive without understanding.
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:28.820]   - That makes sense.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:30.760]   - Not that it harms your fertility later
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.080]   but that you're going to have genetic children out there
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:39.080]   and you might potentially, and we are seeing this now,
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:42.400]   we don't know if you individually will have infertility
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.540]   for a variety of reasons
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:46.160]   'cause you're not trying to have a family until much later.
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:48.040]   - But the same concern doesn't seem to exist
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.360]   for men who are donating sperm.
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:50.280]   - I mean, it should.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.160]   There's this whole donor conceived community
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:54.080]   where people are really talking about
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:55.640]   putting new restrictions on,
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:57.760]   will you sperm donation for example.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.680]   There are sperm donors who have hundreds of children,
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:02.720]   hundreds, right?
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.420]   There are these sibling pods because it's been so unlimited
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:09.900]   and sperm banks are a business that work to make money
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:12.740]   and they make money by selling more sperm.
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:14.260]   But that's not healthy.
[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:17.000]   One, for a population you need genetic diversity
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.440]   but also it's not healthy necessarily for one person
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:23.000]   to have all these half siblings
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.080]   and to just not know when you're going to run into somebody
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:28.440]   who could potentially be your sibling.
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.400]   Is it this guy at the bar that you like?
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.200]   Do you have to worry about that if your donor conceived?
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:35.160]   So we're starting to see sperm banks
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.560]   finally start to reel back
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.800]   and put limitations on how many families.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:40.960]   Total children's tough, right?
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:43.400]   Because one family might have a child
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.960]   and you want them to be able to have sibling children
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:47.520]   but at least for how many families
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.440]   that that donor can contribute to.
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:53.340]   And we're seeing sperm donors deal with the fact
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:56.260]   that now there's no anonymous donation.
[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:58.860]   We can act like anonymous donation exists,
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:11:01.580]   meaning it is not identified at the time
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:04.160]   that somebody is utilizing the sperm.
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:07.440]   But with direct to consumer testing for genetics,
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:10.160]   like 23andMe and Ancestry,
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.380]   people are being connected with their sperm donors,
[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:16.500]   with their egg donors, with their sibling pods
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:18.360]   and we have to believe that technology
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.040]   is only going to improve over time.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:23.260]   So what people do for money,
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.880]   especially when they're young,
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:28.180]   I think without understanding the potential ramifications
[02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:30.560]   and I don't wanna act like sperm donation
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.720]   or egg donation are bad,
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:35.400]   they give people the opportunity to become parents
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:37.160]   that otherwise might not be able to
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:40.080]   and that is a lovely and a beautiful gift
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:43.340]   but you need to understand what that might mean
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:46.480]   and how that might impact your own potential children
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:49.080]   later too to know that they have
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:51.280]   genetic half-siblings out there.
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:54.680]   Egg donation, people do get compensated
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:57.180]   much better than sperm donation.
[02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:59.700]   There's certain characteristics that are hard to find
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:03.280]   that get compensated even more so
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.000]   and certain ethnicities, doctorate degrees
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.760]   and things like that where somebody can really pay
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:12.420]   for their education by donating their eggs.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:17.400]   It's a dilemma because what you'd love to say
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:20.400]   is like free some eggs for you too.
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.640]   If you're gonna do that, you're at the perfect age
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:26.200]   to freeze your own eggs and there's been strategies
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.040]   to try to mitigate this
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:30.900]   and I don't wanna get off too much on a tangent
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:34.160]   but it's a really fine line that you walk
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.220]   with what people understand.
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:37.780]   So there is a company and I won't name them
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:40.560]   but they are promoting that young women donate their eggs
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.940]   and they will freeze half of them for you
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:47.680]   and half of them will go and become donor eggs.
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:48.960]   - Interesting business model
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:51.080]   that I could see the potential ethical concerns.
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:53.160]   - So I think ethically, this sounds good
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:55.040]   'cause you get to freeze some eggs
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:58.320]   but I think more people will donate eggs
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:12:59.560]   than otherwise would have
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:01.920]   for some of the reasons we previously stated
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:04.680]   and I also think you would get more money
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:08.600]   by simply donating your eggs and then turning around
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:11.720]   and paying for a round of freezing your own eggs.
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:14.160]   You would get paid more and you'd have more eggs
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:17.720]   because one of the issues is do you now falsely believe
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:19.160]   that you have enough eggs in the bank
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:22.400]   because you did this split but you don't really have enough
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:25.240]   because we already walked through the math at 20 eggs,
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:27.900]   doesn't really result in such a high probability
[02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:30.440]   of having a multi-child family.
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.240]   So there's a lot of ethical debate
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:36.060]   in gamete and embryo donation.
[02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:37.760]   It definitely is the wild west
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:42.360]   and there's uncharted territory, even in embryo donation.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:44.800]   There's places who are very unethical about it,
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:49.480]   who will only allow people to have embryos
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:52.360]   if they are heterosexual, been married for three years,
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:55.500]   make a certain income, submit to a home study,
[02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:57.480]   yet they let the people have no say
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:59.320]   over the embryos that are transferred,
[02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:03.280]   be it how many, what stage, what quality
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:04.720]   and they're taking people's money
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:08.280]   and putting terrible embryos inside of them
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.960]   and really wasting their resources
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:13.040]   which could have been used in another way.
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:15.800]   - Yeah, the dangers of profitization of biology.
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:18.920]   - Right, and tech, I mean, tech entering spaces is amazing
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:23.300]   but also technology starts to advance before studies, right?
[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:27.200]   Tech is gonna become, has more finance backing
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:29.560]   than we see scientific studies get.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:34.240]   - I feel like one of the major questions out there
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:39.100]   is whether or not IVF babies, we'll just call them that,
[02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:44.100]   have a higher incidence of things like spectrum conditions
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:47.720]   or other developmental trajectories, let's call them.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:49.540]   And I'm not trying to be politically correct here
[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:52.900]   but I think nowadays the word disorder
[02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:54.760]   has to be really carefully examined
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:59.760]   when considering any neurologic and psychiatric situation.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:04.240]   We've had discussions about this on this podcast before
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:07.180]   but a lot of people are wondering, just to be direct,
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:09.520]   a lot of people are wondering, do more IVF babies
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:14.020]   have autism than non-IVF babies?
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:18.440]   - This is a good question and it's changed over time
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.520]   in a couple different ways
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:20.980]   and I think this is important to understand.
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:23.840]   So if we just think about the hormonal environment
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:28.080]   with natural conception and you have a peak estrogen,
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.280]   let's say you have 200 something,
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.980]   you have progesterone being made,
[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:33.720]   the placenta is implanting,
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:38.580]   then what is the main difference with IVF babies?
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:40.460]   And a lot of it has been tied back
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:43.020]   to the uterine environment,
[02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:45.940]   especially in what we call fresh embryo transfers
[02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:48.460]   which is really not a common practice anymore.
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:50.100]   So in a fresh embryo transfer,
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:51.720]   I'm gonna take the eggs out of your body,
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:53.940]   fertilize them in the lab and grow out embryos
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:56.980]   and then I'm going to put the best embryo
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:59.040]   back in your body five days later
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:01.220]   at the natural time of implantation.
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:03.700]   And if we rewind the clock, that's how IVF was done.
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:06.020]   Right, when you couldn't freeze embryos very well
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:07.340]   and they didn't survive.
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:09.820]   And you'd put lots of embryos inside
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:11.140]   because they wouldn't survive
[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:13.080]   and that's the early days of IVF
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.400]   when you saw a lot of multiples,
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:17.040]   a lot of high order multiples
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:20.820]   and of course multiples have their own distinct issues
[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:24.820]   that put them at higher risk for developmental disorders
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:27.420]   and issues with development and birth risk in general.
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:28.260]   Right?
[02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:29.240]   - They're common, to be fair,
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:31.240]   they're commonly referred to as disorders.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.840]   I just think around autism in particular,
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:36.140]   there is a camp, a growing camp out there
[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:39.000]   that one referred to differently.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.760]   We've covered this.
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:42.760]   Anytime this comes up, I bring up both
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:44.480]   just to highlight the fact that yes,
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:47.300]   we are aware and sensitive to that emerging issue.
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:49.440]   Right now, unfortunately, for sake of conversation,
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:51.000]   there's no new nomenclature.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.920]   So we could easily get caught down
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:58.060]   in the attempt to try and smooth over everything
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:00.640]   with everybody and as a consequence, confuse everybody.
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:02.360]   So I think we'll go for clarity forward
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.200]   with the understanding that the nomenclature is changing.
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.080]   Can't even say alcoholism anymore
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:07.780]   because it's alcohol use disorder
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:09.000]   and I don't have a problem with that
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.560]   but a lot of people wonder
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:11.940]   if those are two different things.
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:14.040]   - Which is confusing and we want to simplify science
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:14.880]   for people. - Right, exactly.
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:15.880]   So feel free.
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:18.360]   - Okay, so when we first were doing IVF,
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:19.360]   we're putting embryos back
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:22.040]   in an extremely unnatural environment.
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:24.040]   If you have 20 eggs growing
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:26.720]   and each egg makes 200 picograms of estrogen,
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.480]   suddenly now you have these extremely high
[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:32.200]   super physiologic estrogen levels,
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:33.440]   higher progesterone levels
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:35.320]   because there's more corpus luteums
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:38.520]   and this environment is not the normal
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:40.140]   for how the placenta would invade
[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:43.160]   into that maternal blood circulator
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:46.600]   and a lot of these issues that are commonly associated
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:48.960]   became so because of placental issues.
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:51.200]   So a lot of things like growth restriction,
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:54.080]   small for gestational age, preterm birth,
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:56.100]   which further puts you at risk
[02:17:56.100 --> 02:17:58.500]   for other developmental disorders,
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:00.920]   were associated with these fresh transfers.
[02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:01.760]   The field has changed.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:03.440]   We do a lot of frozen embryo transfers
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:04.680]   and a lot of it for this reason,
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:07.740]   we see huge improvement in neonatal outcomes
[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:12.000]   when you bleed off that high hormonal uterine environment
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.380]   and then regrow the lining of the uterus
[02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:17.320]   in a hormonal level that's more natural
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.120]   and then transfer the embryo
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:23.300]   and we see completely different fetal outcomes.
[02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:25.320]   So that's fantastic
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:27.240]   as far as looking at the change over the field
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:30.480]   but of course, if you take all IVF babies over all time,
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:31.380]   it's a little murky
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:34.280]   because you have modern practice and old practice.
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:39.140]   We also know that infertility people,
[02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:41.240]   if you get diagnosed with infertility,
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:43.120]   so you're under age 35
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:45.440]   and you try to get pregnant with regular periods
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:48.300]   for one year and have not had success
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:50.740]   or you're 35 and older and you've tried for six months
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:51.800]   and you've not had success,
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:55.140]   you meet the medical definition for infertility.
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:59.080]   When that happens, you now statistically,
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.180]   regardless if you get pregnant naturally in the next month
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:03.680]   or you do IVF,
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:06.560]   you have a 1% higher chance of birth defects
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:09.160]   and you have a slightly higher chance
[02:19:09.160 --> 02:19:10.860]   of developmental disorders.
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:14.840]   So is it more population-based versus procedure-based
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:16.580]   and there's probably something to that
[02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:19.360]   to underlying a lot of potentially what goes in
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:21.520]   or what can cause infertility
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.120]   when it comes to quality of eggs or sperm
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:26.640]   or uterine environment
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:29.560]   or things that we're still learning about.
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:31.480]   When it comes to autism specifically,
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:33.620]   the number one strongest association we have
[02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:35.040]   is advanced paternal age.
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:37.440]   So when you look at the people
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:42.440]   and the male sperm comes from an ejaculation after age 50,
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.820]   that one does have the highest significance
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:46.440]   associated with autism
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:48.400]   and also with some other very interesting
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:50.360]   autosomal dominant disorders.
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:53.840]   So we don't wanna take advanced paternal age likely,
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:56.000]   although it does get so much less attention
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:59.040]   than what we call advanced maternal age
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:01.680]   or being over age 35 in a woman.
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:04.340]   And that is purely because of the differences
[02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:07.000]   in the sperm and the egg environment
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000]   and how their quality is impactful.
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000]   - Thank you for that answer.
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:13.880]   I think it's really important for people to hear that
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:17.920]   because the lore out there is that IVF,
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.480]   higher incidence of autism and IVF babies,
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:23.260]   but it sounds like a good percentage of those.
[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:26.400]   Could be because of age related factors
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:29.700]   as well as technology related factors
[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:33.660]   and that the technology is getting better all the time
[02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:35.660]   if I understood correctly.
[02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:38.660]   We didn't complete the discussion of IVF
[02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:39.480]   and I want to do that,
[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:40.980]   talk about ICSI and a few other things.
[02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:42.900]   I know that's definitely your wheelhouse.
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:44.080]   Before we do that,
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:48.180]   can we inject a little sub conversation around this
[02:20:48.180 --> 02:20:50.700]   because I neglected to bring this up earlier
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:52.600]   and I know there's a lot of curiosity about this
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:55.660]   and then we'll finish off IVF.
[02:20:55.660 --> 02:20:56.560]   Can we do that? - Let's do it.
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:20:58.080]   - Sort of a pause in the IVF.
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:21:00.280]   So the eggs are out, they're frozen,
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:01.660]   sperm's out, it's frozen,
[02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:03.780]   or maybe they're going to put live sperm on,
[02:21:03.780 --> 02:21:05.580]   a non-frozen, excuse me,
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:07.860]   sperm directly onto those unfrozen eggs.
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:08.860]   We'll pause there,
[02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:11.560]   intermission for those potential embryos.
[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:18.000]   And talk about something that you've been very open about,
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.900]   which is, and a lot of people are not,
[02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:22.780]   frankly, in your profession.
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:23.820]   So I really appreciate this,
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:25.620]   which is nutrition and supplementation
[02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:28.900]   to optimize the health of egg quality
[02:21:28.900 --> 02:21:32.260]   and not just for people who want to get pregnant,
[02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:36.200]   but for people who believe that fertility
[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:38.200]   is a proxy for overall health.
[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:39.040]   So, I mean,
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:41.340]   are there things that people should eat and not eat,
[02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:43.740]   things that people should supplement and not supplement
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:47.500]   in order to optimize their fertility?
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:49.280]   - I mean, this is definitely an interest of mine, right?
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:51.240]   All my fellowship research cycles around
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:53.400]   fecundability and natural fertility.
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:55.320]   And I think we really do a disservice
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:59.560]   by how medicine really is categorized by organ systems,
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:01.980]   because we act like things in one place
[02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.240]   don't impact the other.
[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:04.200]   - As if. - Right?
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:06.540]   But you have a body and your body,
[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:07.960]   and especially your hormones,
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.280]   change and fluctuate and they're meant to.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:13.080]   They are meant to be a dynamic system,
[02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:15.360]   but the world and the environment
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:19.160]   of which you are subjecting your body to
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:23.200]   has proven changes on both hormonal function
[02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:26.360]   and also when it comes to egg and sperm quality.
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:27.400]   And so if you are somebody
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:29.480]   who just wants to live your healthiest life
[02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:32.480]   and have your most regular periods
[02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:35.780]   and have your hormones as well balanced as they can be,
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:37.480]   for a lack of a better word,
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:38.360]   we'll just say that that means
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.100]   that they're functioning normally,
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:41.940]   then paying attention to the things that you do
[02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:43.020]   are really important.
[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:45.000]   And so I know this is a big one for you.
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.400]   Sleep is probably the number one thing that people don't do
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:49.720]   that does impact their reproductive hormone system
[02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:52.680]   and therefore can impact egg and sperm quality
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:54.960]   because sleep is when you have cellular repair
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:57.280]   and when you can drop your inflammation levels.
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:02.280]   We know that inflammation is just toxic to eggs and sperm.
[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:03.240]   It is.
[02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:07.960]   The inflammatory environment is not ideal for conception.
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:11.020]   And then for a female, you have to deal with the fact
[02:23:11.020 --> 02:23:12.760]   that you have your egg quality,
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:15.340]   but you also have how inflammation
[02:23:15.340 --> 02:23:18.260]   or what you're exposed to impacts your uterine environment.
[02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:21.940]   So you have a two-fold situation here.
[02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:24.660]   So none of this should be shocking news
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:26.340]   when it comes to nutrition,
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:29.260]   but it is not talked about enough, you're right.
[02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:32.640]   Decreasing inflammation by the foods that we put in our body
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:37.360]   is consistently shown with an improvement in fecundability,
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:39.340]   an improvement in ovulation,
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:41.840]   and an improvement in success with IVF,
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:44.340]   and a decrease in miscarriage, right?
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:46.680]   Huge studies have looked at these.
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:51.160]   Now, the big caveat is that nutrition studies are super hard
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:55.320]   because people who consume flax, for example,
[02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:58.140]   tend to have other good health behaviors
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:01.600]   that sometimes make it hard to identify what flax did
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.120]   versus their general health
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:07.100]   versus somebody who eats fast food every day.
[02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:09.460]   So nutrition studies tend to be observational,
[02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:11.600]   and fertility studies are really hard too
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:14.840]   because what endpoint are you using?
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:15.760]   Is it getting pregnant?
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:16.800]   Is it live birth?
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:18.120]   Are you looking at IVF?
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:19.800]   Are you looking at natural fertility?
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:22.160]   And we have a lot of different overlap
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:24.840]   that makes both of these a little bit difficult.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:28.420]   And so they're all cohort-based or population-based studies
[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:31.060]   where you analyze how people perform
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:32.680]   when it comes to fertility treatments
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:34.500]   or getting pregnant naturally
[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:37.200]   based on their exposures to certain things.
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:40.880]   Diets high in fruits and vegetables are good for you, right?
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.320]   Fiber, antioxidants.
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:43.460]   Fruit is not bad.
[02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:45.400]   Fruit got this really bad reputation.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:46.240]   - Really? I love fruit.
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:48.360]   - I love fruit too, but people think that it has sugar
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:49.560]   and that it's bad for you.
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:51.040]   - Well, it has fructose, but, you know.
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.560]   - No, it's not, that type of sugar is not bad for you.
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:55.400]   If we can just agree on the fact
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:57.780]   that fruit has a lot of nutritional benefit,
[02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:00.360]   especially when it comes to vitamins and antioxidants,
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:03.520]   that can be extremely beneficial in decreasing inflammation.
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:06.600]   Grains, so whole grains, especially,
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:08.800]   that your body provide a lot of great fiber.
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:11.200]   So, of course, if you have celiac
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:13.920]   or you're gluten intolerant, you're a different category,
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:15.840]   but there was so much focus on keto
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.240]   and people eliminating grains as a food group overall.
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:20.800]   And even though that might be utilized
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:23.240]   in a dietary strategy to lose weight
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:26.160]   and losing weight can improve fertility,
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:30.840]   likely because of inflammation being the primary driver,
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:32.880]   because we know that even in studies
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:36.700]   where I take donor eggs and I transfer that embryo
[02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:38.940]   into somebody who's overweight,
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:40.460]   they have lower odds of success
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:43.080]   than if they were a normal BMI.
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:46.100]   So we can't act like that causation
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:48.260]   is just on egg quality from obesity, right?
[02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:51.860]   There's also some inflammation, some inflammatory changes
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:55.860]   that impact the body's ability or desire
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:25:57.960]   to allow an embryo to implant.
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:02.760]   So fruits, veggies, whole grains are all good.
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:07.380]   Interestingly, dairy, dairy tends to be okay in most studies,
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:10.900]   but what we do see is that if you're gonna have dairy,
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:15.680]   have the real thing, the processed dairy, the skim milk,
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:18.440]   that actually decreases your fertility.
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:20.780]   And likely because the processing
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:23.780]   to make it still look like milk when you take out the fat
[02:26:23.780 --> 02:26:26.400]   is adding in things that are unnatural,
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:28.400]   potentially impacting your fertility.
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:29.440]   - I don't drink milk anymore,
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:31.600]   but when I was a teenager, I drank half and half.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:32.860]   I'm not recommending anyone do that.
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:34.220]   Remember I was a skiing teenager.
[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:35.340]   - You were trying to bulk up.
[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:36.560]   - Well, no, I just could afford to.
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.980]   I wasn't trying, at that age, I wasn't trying to at all,
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:41.780]   but it was just delicious.
[02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:44.020]   But so cheeses,
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:50.040]   full fat milk, half and half, yogurt, okay.
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:51.500]   - Yeah, but don't choose the skim one.
[02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:55.580]   Choose the actual one that comes with some of the milk fat.
[02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:56.740]   Fat is not bad for you.
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:58.560]   There's also this, right?
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:26:59.540]   Hopefully we're getting away from it,
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:01.340]   but there's been such a low fat craze
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:04.460]   or this real attention that fat is so bad.
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:08.360]   But fat comes in so many important forms,
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:13.220]   avocados and oils and nuts, dairy, meat.
[02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:17.020]   Fat and cholesterol are the backbone for all hormones, right?
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:20.040]   So you need that in order for your body
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:22.820]   to make the estrogen and progesterone that it needs
[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:25.260]   to allow this whole process to happen.
[02:27:25.260 --> 02:27:28.220]   And so there's this idea that those are bad for you.
[02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:29.060]   That's just really not.
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:31.860]   So healthy fats, whole grains, fruits, veggies.
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:33.040]   - And what about proteins and meats?
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:35.340]   Because I think within those categories,
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:39.980]   I'm a big fan of sustainably raised meats if possible.
[02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:42.480]   Some people choose not to eat meat, but fish, eggs.
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:44.300]   - Love it all.
[02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:45.820]   Okay, so let's just go through the meats
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:47.700]   and the myth and the facts.
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:49.540]   So we'll do tofu.
[02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:51.820]   So there's this big issue that tofu has soy
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:53.800]   and that too much soy can be bad
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:56.120]   because soy can be a phytoestrogen.
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:59.420]   Tofu does not negatively impact fertility, even in men.
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:00.840]   In fact, it can improve it
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:03.560]   because it does have some antioxidant-like properties,
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:04.660]   lots of iron.
[02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:08.700]   When it comes to fish, fish are fantastic sources
[02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:11.220]   of healthy fats and omega-3 fatty acids,
[02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:15.200]   which are very crucial in the reproductive process.
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:17.280]   We do worry about if you're pregnant,
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:20.320]   having too much fish and overexposure to mercury
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:22.920]   and how that can impact fetal brain development.
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:26.480]   So the general recommendation is three servings per week.
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:27.320]   That doesn't-
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:28.900]   - Let me guess, a serving is like four to six ounces
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:31.300]   as opposed to like a real human that eats, you know.
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:32.140]   - A real human.
[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:36.680]   - Yeah, that eats six to eight ounces of fish, right.
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:38.320]   - And I think it's important to say,
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:39.900]   even though people will tell you that
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:41.300]   when you're trying to get pregnant
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:42.520]   with the idea of we don't know
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:44.680]   when you're going to be pregnant,
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:47.300]   if you're going through things like egg freezing or IVF
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:49.560]   and you know when you're going to be pregnant,
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.660]   I wouldn't feel like you have to restrict yourself
[02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:55.320]   on the consumption of seafood during those time periods
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:56.620]   when you know you're not pregnant yet.
[02:28:56.620 --> 02:28:59.400]   Because really the concern is about that mercury
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:01.680]   and what it could potentially do to a fetal brain.
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:02.840]   - And raw seafood, correct?
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:04.180]   No sushi, no sashimi.
[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:05.300]   - Well, when you're pregnant, correct.
[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:08.220]   And that's mostly because of the risk of infectious disease
[02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:11.400]   that can cause severe brain development and other issues.
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:12.680]   - What do they do in Japan?
[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:13.520]   - I don't know.
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:14.340]   I don't live there.
[02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:15.180]   - They probably laugh at this.
[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:16.460]   - They probably do laugh at us.
[02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:17.940]   They probably do laugh at us a lot.
[02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:21.280]   - Someone who's been pregnant in Japan.
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:22.120]   - Yeah, reach out, tell us.
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:23.680]   - Yeah, or conceived in Japan.
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:25.900]   Tell us, don't tell us the story of the conception.
[02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:28.460]   But tell us, did you have sashimi?
[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:33.600]   - Overall, meat is a really broad category
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:35.200]   and studies study it differently.
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:36.280]   Like, is it all meat?
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:40.440]   Are you distinguishing now red meat and chicken?
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:42.600]   Are you putting it all together?
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:44.800]   I mean, obviously I think we can all come to the agreement
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:46.480]   that processed meats are not good
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:48.760]   for a variety of different reasons.
[02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:50.760]   In addition to being carcinogenic,
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:54.080]   those toxins do negatively impact fertility.
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:54.920]   Now--
[02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:56.080]   - So deli meat, no bueno.
[02:29:56.080 --> 02:29:59.260]   - So yeah, but in specifically those things like the bacon
[02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:03.560]   and the things that are really highly processed hot dogs.
[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:06.120]   Sorry, the 4th of July hot dog picnic.
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:08.780]   But those things really do not provide
[02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:12.280]   nutritional advantages and only harm.
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:14.440]   Especially then when we have red meat.
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:18.080]   For the most part, red meat when isolated individually
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:22.880]   in most circumstances in moderation tends to be fine.
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.800]   I usually tell my patients,
[02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:27.560]   I want them to eat a plant-forward diet.
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.760]   That doesn't mean no meat.
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:31.060]   But I say, look at your meat servings.
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:33.520]   I don't want it red meat every single day.
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:35.840]   Because there was a study looking at IVF
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:38.840]   and looking at embryos and the more servings,
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:41.360]   a lot of nutritional studies based things on quartile.
[02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:43.800]   So who eats the lowest and the second most
[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:45.780]   and the third most and the top most.
[02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:49.380]   And people who ate in that top quartile of red meat
[02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:52.340]   had lower progression of embryos through the culture.
[02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:55.500]   So less embryos, that developed.
[02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:59.100]   Less normal embryos and lower success rates.
[02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:02.220]   - Do we know anything about how that meat was arriving?
[02:31:02.220 --> 02:31:03.060]   - No, unfortunately we don't.
[02:31:03.060 --> 02:31:04.860]   - Are we talking about like hoagie sandwiches
[02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:06.580]   or are we talking about like grass-fed steaks?
[02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:08.700]   - Right, these studies are not wonderful,
[02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:10.940]   but that doesn't mean that they don't hold merit
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:12.700]   in helping us guide counseling.
[02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:16.180]   But no, that one was how many servings of red meat
[02:31:16.180 --> 02:31:17.580]   do you eat in a week, right?
[02:31:17.580 --> 02:31:19.100]   So we don't really know.
[02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:22.780]   Does the really ethically sourced, the grass-fed,
[02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:27.020]   this environment which we feel like is much less toxic
[02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:29.300]   than potentially let's say like a cattle factory
[02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:31.420]   where the cows are injected with all sorts of things,
[02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:35.420]   is there a difference in how those impact your reproduction?
[02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:36.300]   Probably, right?
[02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:38.300]   If this cow is getting injected with a lot of hormones,
[02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:41.400]   why are we thinking that it's not impacting the meat
[02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:43.700]   that you're then ingesting into your body?
[02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:44.860]   - No, I think our audience
[02:31:44.860 --> 02:31:48.820]   will certainly subscribe to that idea.
[02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:49.760]   I think most of them will.
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:52.420]   I mean, the notion that like the pollutants
[02:31:52.420 --> 02:31:55.160]   you breathe in the air somehow are not the air
[02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:56.220]   that you breathe into your lungs
[02:31:56.220 --> 02:31:57.940]   is just like completely naive.
[02:31:57.940 --> 02:31:58.760]   - Wild.
[02:31:58.760 --> 02:31:59.600]   - And the idea-
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:01.140]   - But people feel that way and they hold strongly
[02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:05.300]   to this idea that it can't be this thing that I love
[02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:07.940]   that is causing this problem, right?
[02:32:07.940 --> 02:32:11.420]   The denial of the association between
[02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:13.880]   what we put in and on our body
[02:32:13.880 --> 02:32:16.520]   and how it impacts our body's function
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:18.160]   is really strong in some people.
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:22.960]   And I think it's really just lack of education and awareness
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:25.760]   because the medical community for so long
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:27.940]   did not address these factors, right?
[02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:31.000]   Your doctor never talks to you about nutrition.
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:35.080]   And so it just became this idea that it must not matter,
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:37.940]   otherwise your doctor would talk to you about it.
[02:32:37.940 --> 02:32:39.700]   I think sugar is the last thing I just didn't mention,
[02:32:39.700 --> 02:32:44.700]   but added sugar and artificial sugars are bad for you.
[02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:46.020]   - Artificial sugars.
[02:32:46.020 --> 02:32:47.460]   - Artificial sugars too.
[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:50.060]   - Including stevia, sort of plant-based,
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:51.100]   low calorie sweeteners.
[02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:52.660]   - Stevia itself hasn't been studied
[02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:54.040]   as much as the other ones,
[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:57.760]   things like sweet and low and all of those.
[02:32:57.760 --> 02:33:00.520]   But what we do know is that they interfere,
[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:02.280]   they cause inflammation inside the body.
[02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:05.680]   And then they also can cause a stress reaction
[02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:09.640]   and they can cause higher rates of miscarriage
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:12.720]   when you intake more sugar and artificial sugar.
[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:15.640]   So that's a lot to wrap your head around.
[02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:17.740]   And I say the same thing to every patient.
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:21.500]   One cake, one this, one hot dog.
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:22.800]   I mean, those things individually
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:24.360]   are not gonna make a difference, right?
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:27.500]   It's the choices that you make every single day
[02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:28.960]   that are going to set you up
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:30.460]   to be your healthy self or not.
[02:33:30.460 --> 02:33:32.600]   And so you should make choices
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:34.620]   in line with how you wanna treat yourself.
[02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:36.720]   You want to be in your best health,
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:38.740]   you want your hormones functioning the best.
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:42.920]   And if that added helps you get pregnant when you want to,
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:45.500]   helps you have a better chance of success with IVF,
[02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:48.460]   oh my gosh, what a fantastic benefit.
[02:33:48.460 --> 02:33:50.040]   But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.540]   some of these bad things here and there,
[02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:56.480]   as long as you've set yourself up on the day-to-day
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:59.580]   where you're giving your body lots of nutritious food
[02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:02.040]   that it needs to make hormones.
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:05.740]   Similarly, being very underweight and calorie restricting,
[02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:08.640]   we all know is really terrible for your reproductive system
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:11.420]   and can cause the brain to totally shut down ovulation
[02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:15.580]   because it senses that you can't have a pregnancy.
[02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:18.200]   - Do people miscarry, excuse me,
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:19.800]   by virtue of being underweight?
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:24.640]   Does the body, like I learned some years ago,
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:25.660]   I think this is still true,
[02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:28.480]   that one of the signals for the onset of puberty in females
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:32.920]   is that leptin hormone is secreted from body fat
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:35.720]   that then signals to the brain, to the hypothalamus,
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:39.840]   like, okay, there's enough reserves to create environment.
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:42.000]   It's a signal about environmental-
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.520]   - Yeah, there's enough extra fat to have a baby.
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:45.400]   - Yeah, and there's presumably enough food around
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:47.500]   to sustain that baby, right.
[02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:52.140]   Are miscarriages and lack of body fat correlated?
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.000]   - On both ends of the spectrum, yes, right?
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.200]   So lack of body fat and being overweight,
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:01.160]   we see decrease in getting pregnant per month
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:04.240]   and we see increase in losing pregnancies.
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:07.520]   So certainly there is a healthy medium
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:09.880]   where your body has what it needs.
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:12.440]   And that makes sense because if you have,
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:14.680]   I like to even say hypothalamic dysfunction.
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:16.840]   So maybe your brain's not totally shut off
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:19.880]   where it's sending out no hormones and you're not ovulating
[02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:22.040]   'cause you're not getting pregnant in that circumstance.
[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:24.840]   But certainly ovulation disorders are on a spectrum
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:27.520]   where you go from a perfectly synchronized cycle
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:30.320]   to one that prolongs it, gets shorter together,
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:32.320]   then prolongs, and then you have nothing.
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:34.200]   There's this spectrum of dysfunction,
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:36.320]   which is representing your hormones
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:39.400]   not being necessarily perfect.
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.520]   And that can have impacts on the placenta
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:44.120]   trying to grow into that uterus.
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:46.160]   I mean, the placenta is fascinating, right?
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:48.080]   An entire talk just on the placenta.
[02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:50.120]   But it does this incredible job
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:51.840]   where your body has to not reject it,
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:54.600]   yet allow it to eat away at the side of your uterus
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:56.680]   and grow into your blood vessels.
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:59.480]   But that requires a very specific hormonal environment
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:02.320]   for it to be done and to be done right.
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:03.760]   I think in the same breath of all of this,
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:06.240]   what you're also asking is yeah, okay,
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:07.240]   so that's eating healthy.
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:09.220]   None of that's really new news for most people.
[02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:10.760]   A lot of those things I just said.
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:12.480]   - Well, I think some, but I do want to thank you
[02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:14.440]   'cause I think rarely, if ever,
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:17.080]   do we hear somebody, a physician,
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:19.800]   be really direct about like, hey, listen, some red meat,
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:21.680]   yes, not excessive amounts of red meat,
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:25.600]   ideally from sustainable sources,
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:28.400]   whole fat milk products, grains, fruits, vegetables.
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:30.080]   I mean, those kind of straight,
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:32.040]   what to you seem like straightforward directives
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:34.480]   are actually pretty rare in the landscape
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:35.960]   of public health discussion
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:37.880]   because more often than not,
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:39.000]   people talk about nutrition
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.980]   in these kind of elimination diet type things
[02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:43.840]   like eliminate all the grains or eliminate all the meat
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:47.060]   or eliminate all the milk fats,
[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:48.800]   when in reality, I think people forget
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:51.720]   that like most people out there are omnivores
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:54.380]   and they can make better choices about not deli meat,
[02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:56.300]   you know, less bacon, if any bacon, right?
[02:36:56.300 --> 02:36:57.800]   - Have some veggies with your lunch, right?
[02:36:57.800 --> 02:36:59.840]   Like you can make better choices on the day-to-day.
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:01.900]   I think that is a great point.
[02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:03.520]   I think there's a place for supplements.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:04.680]   I think the big disclaimer
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:06.240]   that everybody's going to say with supplements
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:08.980]   is that they are not regulated
[02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:11.760]   like the way medications are, right?
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:16.200]   And I will say supplements and herbs are different things,
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:19.960]   right, a supplement, but many companies are adding herbs
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:20.940]   to their supplements
[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:23.760]   and that can get into really murky territory,
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:26.300]   especially when it comes to how some of these herbs
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:28.800]   do have estrogen and progestin-like properties
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:31.480]   and can impact reproduction and hormones.
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:33.200]   - And perhaps even androgenic properties too.
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:34.040]   - Yes, yes.
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:37.040]   So we can't act like everything's created equal.
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:38.140]   So I always tell people,
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:41.360]   if I recommend you take a supplement or your doctor does,
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:44.440]   your due diligence is to look at what is also included
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:48.040]   and make sure it doesn't have these extra added things
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:49.280]   that they're unaware of
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:52.360]   because sometimes they can have negative impact
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:53.880]   at one stage of your life or another,
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:55.640]   depending on where you are.
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:58.580]   Certainly, a prenatal vitamin, which has folic acid,
[02:37:58.580 --> 02:38:01.600]   we all know that folic acid is really important
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:02.960]   to prevent neural tube defects,
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:04.920]   but it's also important in cell division
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:08.800]   and how the ovary is growing follicles and growing eggs.
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:11.480]   - So should people, women,
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:14.560]   but also men be taking a vitamin with folic acid
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:17.200]   even when they're not trying to conceive?
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:19.560]   - There's no harm in having it,
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:22.420]   but very often pregnancies occur
[02:38:22.420 --> 02:38:24.360]   when you're not trying to conceive.
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.040]   And that is a store that needs to be built up
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:28.160]   three months ahead of time.
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:31.120]   So we really need you to be taking that
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:32.640]   ahead of getting pregnant.
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:34.980]   So not just, let's get pregnant right now,
[02:38:34.980 --> 02:38:37.260]   I'm going to start this prenatal vitamin.
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:40.380]   So I recommend anybody who's in their reproductive years,
[02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:42.040]   take a prenatal vitamin.
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:44.480]   We also know that many, many people
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:47.440]   are vitamin D deficient and vitamin D
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.840]   does impact reproduction.
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:53.100]   And so I usually say a thousand international units
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:55.940]   of vitamin D is not going to be harmful in anybody.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:58.160]   It's going to be helpful for most people.
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:01.400]   Some people definitely need higher levels.
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:03.320]   So we screen everybody with a vitamin D
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:05.720]   to see who needs to have extra.
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:08.900]   But a blanket statement that extra vitamin D
[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:10.440]   is going to be helpful.
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:13.700]   Omega-3 fatty acids, also extremely important
[02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:16.060]   in one, being anti-inflammatory,
[02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:18.920]   but two, brain development of a fetus.
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:21.600]   So most prenatals now actually do have
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:23.840]   those omega-3 fatty acids in them,
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:26.920]   but if they don't, I recommend a patient take those.
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:30.600]   - Just a brief question/insertion there.
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:31.740]   There's a laboratory up at
[02:39:31.740 --> 02:39:33.280]   the University of California, Santa Barbara
[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:34.680]   that's published some really interesting data
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:38.080]   showing that essentially brain weight,
[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:41.280]   which is just about one indirect measure of brain health,
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:45.200]   but brain weight at birth seems to be correlated,
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:46.620]   at least in some positive way,
[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:49.240]   with the amount of essential fatty acids
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:51.400]   that mom consumed during pregnancy.
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:52.940]   Does that sound, does that hold?
[02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:54.480]   - Yeah, I mean, that does hold.
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.820]   And there's, I mean, like there's my studies
[02:39:57.820 --> 02:40:00.340]   about that mice are smarter when they have diets,
[02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:02.700]   you know, with omega-3 fatty acids
[02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:04.880]   when they are in utero, right?
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:07.160]   So the exposure and the time period is really important.
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:09.000]   And omega-3s have a lot of health benefits
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.300]   when it comes to their antioxidant properties,
[02:40:11.300 --> 02:40:14.580]   especially in like an endometriosis,
[02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:17.640]   diseases that are very highly inflammatory,
[02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:19.920]   they can be very beneficial.
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:21.120]   - We're definitely going to talk about your work
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:22.800]   about after a baby has arrived
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:24.360]   and impact of essential fatty acids,
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:27.000]   but what would you say is the dosage cut off?
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.560]   On this podcast before I've sort of thrown out numbers
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:34.560]   like one to two grams per day of the EPA form
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:36.040]   of essential fatty acids,
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:37.280]   and then we could have a whole discussion
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:38.840]   about omega-3 omega-6 ratios,
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:41.400]   but do you think there's a upper limit?
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.440]   Is it truly that, you know,
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:46.680]   let's say up to four grams per day of EPA,
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:48.380]   is, would that be advantageous?
[02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:49.560]   Is it better than one gram?
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:50.840]   - I tell people a gram.
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:52.320]   - A gram, okay, that's in alignment
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:54.640]   with pretty much what we've talked about before.
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:55.880]   - So that's what I recommend, you know,
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:40:57.720]   when I give my handout to my patients
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:58.840]   and they're trying to get pregnant,
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:02.200]   it's going to have a prenatal, a thousand I use of vitamin D,
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:04.940]   a gram of omega-3s and then CoQ10.
[02:41:04.940 --> 02:41:09.940]   So CoQ10, which, you know, essentially in general
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:11.760]   is trying to help the mitochondria.
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:13.040]   That's the whole idea here
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:16.720]   that it is helping provide support across the body
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:17.820]   in a lot of different ways, right?
[02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:20.760]   Like CoQ10 is used in a lot of different areas of the body,
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:22.400]   but when it comes to reproduction,
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:25.200]   when it comes to meiosis and cell division
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:28.920]   and ovulation and egg quality and even sperm quality,
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:33.800]   there's a place for CoQ10 showing benefit without harm,
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:36.280]   right, and so no, like I said earlier,
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:38.060]   nothing's without any harm or any risk of harm,
[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:39.020]   but very, very little.
[02:41:39.020 --> 02:41:41.440]   So I usually recommend if you're trying to get pregnant
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:45.100]   and you take CoQ10, a dose of 200 milligrams
[02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:46.120]   three times a day.
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:47.380]   So there's kind of a higher dose
[02:41:47.380 --> 02:41:49.040]   than sometimes people are on.
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:53.080]   Often prenatals now have just like 200 total in it.
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:53.920]   And so-
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:55.060]   - The expensive ingredients
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:58.500]   are usually the lower concentrations in blends.
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:41:59.560]   - They're going to use just enough
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:00.760]   so they can put it on the label.
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:03.020]   - Right, which includes CoQ10.
[02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:04.500]   Does the form of CoQ10 matter?
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:06.060]   'Cause you'll find them in gel capsules.
[02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:09.260]   You'll also find them in powdered capsules.
[02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:10.420]   - I always say, I mean,
[02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:12.440]   there might be for the individual person.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.360]   I mean, absorption of medication
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.460]   is really dependent a lot on gut health and other factors.
[02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:18.900]   But the number one issue with supplementation
[02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:20.640]   is that people don't stick to it.
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:21.520]   So I always say,
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:23.700]   whichever one you're going to consistently take
[02:42:23.700 --> 02:42:25.340]   is going to be the better form.
[02:42:25.340 --> 02:42:26.480]   - Right.
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:28.020]   A question about L-carnitine.
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:29.140]   - Yeah.
[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:32.700]   - I'm researching a little bit for this episode and others.
[02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:36.220]   Oral L-carnitine has been associated with some improvements
[02:42:36.220 --> 02:42:39.020]   in forward motility and sperm, maybe egg quality.
[02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:40.680]   But we know that a very small percentage
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:42.460]   of the oral L-carnitine that one ingests
[02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:44.420]   is actually utilized.
[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:46.620]   So some people actually purchase and use
[02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:48.440]   injectable L-carnitine, which is kind of painful
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:50.240]   'cause it's an alcohol-based suspension.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:52.160]   So not comfortable.
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:53.460]   It's gotta be done intramuscularly.
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:56.980]   But my read of the data is kind of impressive.
[02:42:56.980 --> 02:42:58.420]   I wouldn't say super impressive.
[02:42:58.420 --> 02:43:00.920]   Are you ever injecting patients
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:03.620]   or having them inject themselves with L-carnitine?
[02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:08.540]   This would be both female or male patients or both,
[02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:10.020]   or using oral L-carnitine?
[02:43:10.020 --> 02:43:12.700]   Or do the data just not impress you enough to motivate that?
[02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:15.620]   - We use a gram of L-carnitine with a gram of vitamin C
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:19.900]   for our male patients who have any abnormal sperm parameter.
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:21.460]   And so that is kind of what we consider
[02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:23.340]   the sperm enhancement protocol.
[02:43:23.340 --> 02:43:25.040]   And so- - And just that?
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:25.880]   - That with a multivitamin. - Got it.
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:28.460]   - So those two with a multivitamin and CoQ10.
[02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:30.640]   So that's kind of like the male protocol.
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:32.580]   Of course, there's different specifics
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:34.260]   for one individual person.
[02:43:34.260 --> 02:43:37.420]   I don't tend to recommend it for most females.
[02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:40.060]   That being said, those who have endometriosis
[02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:44.280]   fall into a unique category where inflammation is so high
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:46.900]   that usually it's a different environment
[02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:50.000]   where we recommend L-carnitine, N-acetylcysteine,
[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.720]   vitamin C and E.
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:53.160]   They kind of fall into a different category
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:55.000]   'cause they have a known inflammatory disease.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.580]   But if we're just talking about the person at whole
[02:43:57.580 --> 02:43:59.600]   who maybe wants to take some supplements
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:01.420]   for their reproductive health
[02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:03.900]   that have very little side effects
[02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:06.620]   and for the most part can potentially be helpful,
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:10.860]   it's gonna be CoQ10, L-carnitine, vitamin C can be helpful,
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:12.380]   especially for the male.
[02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:14.260]   For the female partner,
[02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:16.860]   we're gonna be looking at that extra vitamin D
[02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:18.940]   in addition to the prenatal with folic acid.
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:20.740]   - And what about women with PCOS?
[02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:21.980]   I get so many questions about PCOS.
[02:44:21.980 --> 02:44:23.760]   - Inositol, yeah, yeah. - Inositol.
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:26.980]   So, and there are we talking myoinositol
[02:44:26.980 --> 02:44:29.180]   or the, what is it, the D-Chiro?
[02:44:29.180 --> 02:44:30.020]   Do I have that right?
[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:30.840]   - You do have that right.
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:33.100]   Myoinositol is the main driver of inositol
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:34.640]   and how it can be helpful.
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:37.680]   If you, most blends are gonna have a combination
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:40.160]   of both of them but a much higher ratio
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:42.720]   of myoinositol to D-Chiro.
[02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:44.640]   And so myoinositol is probably the one
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:47.920]   that really is doing the work in PCOS.
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:48.840]   What is it doing?
[02:44:48.840 --> 02:44:50.620]   It is definitely helping the body
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:53.000]   when it comes to insulin and sugar,
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.340]   helping the body be more sensitive to insulin
[02:44:56.340 --> 02:44:58.480]   or less resistant to it.
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:02.820]   Essentially helping you respond to what you eat
[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:04.520]   in a better way.
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:07.220]   And it also looks like it does potentially decrease
[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:11.000]   some of that inflammation pathway in PCOS.
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.980]   In PCOS, this insulin resistance correlates
[02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:17.920]   with this testosterone production from the ovary.
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:19.860]   Meaning even metformin alone
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:21.840]   can decrease testosterone levels
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:24.680]   based on some of the change that it has in the ovary.
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:26.000]   - Take note, men.
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.800]   I have so many guys taking metformin or berberine
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:29.840]   thinking, "Oh, this is great.
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:30.820]   I'm gonna lower my blood sugar,
[02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:32.280]   mimic fasting and live longer."
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:34.220]   And then these are also the same people
[02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:35.360]   who are writing to me, go,
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:36.680]   "How come when I take metformin,
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:37.920]   I either have headaches
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:40.680]   'cause I'm essentially hypoglycemic,
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:44.240]   but also their testosterone levels are getting crushed."
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.280]   Not in every case, but it happens.
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:48.120]   - And I think those are things
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:49.440]   people just don't think about.
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:51.520]   They read that a supplement might be beneficial
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:54.040]   for this one thing that doesn't apply to them
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:55.720]   and they start taking it.
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:57.600]   Also the evidence on metformin extending life,
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:45:59.420]   we had Peter T. on here talk about this,
[02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:03.040]   the evidence for that is like, "Oh, so poor."
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:04.620]   It's just not really that convincing.
[02:46:04.620 --> 02:46:06.760]   It may change, but then now all the excitement
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:07.720]   is about rapamycin.
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:11.260]   And so extending your life while plummeting your testosterone
[02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:12.600]   you know what I mean?
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:13.900]   Actually that strategy has been tried
[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:14.960]   in the longevity community.
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:16.640]   There was this whole castration idea.
[02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:17.820]   - Oh, I don't like this.
[02:46:17.820 --> 02:46:19.520]   - Oh yeah, this was like the Heaven's Gate cult
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:20.880]   where they castrated themselves.
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:21.800]   - Did they live longer?
[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:23.720]   - Well, they ended up committing mass suicide.
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:24.560]   - Oh no.
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:26.760]   - So they ended the experiment early.
[02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:33.040]   Yeah, so in any event, going back to supplements,
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:34.620]   sorry, I couldn't help myself.
[02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:38.200]   Supplements that women can potentially take
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:40.440]   just to increase their fertility
[02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:41.800]   even if they don't want to get pregnant
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:44.160]   as just kind of creating a milieu of health.
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:46.160]   You talked about the nutrition, you talked about CoQ10,
[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:48.440]   maybe L-carnitine, vitamin C,
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:53.460]   the essential fatty acids getting at least one gram of EPA.
[02:46:53.460 --> 02:46:57.040]   So that might require taking two grams of fish oil
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:59.320]   to get the EPA.
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:01.360]   Myo-inositol, so how much are you talking about?
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:03.320]   I've seen some pretty high dosages thrown out there.
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:06.000]   - For myo-inositol, 2000 milligrams.
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.440]   - Okay, taken before sleep or does it matter?
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:10.200]   - That one doesn't matter, that one doesn't matter.
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:12.360]   - Thank you for covering the topic of supplements
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:14.080]   and supplementation.
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:15.960]   This is probably a good point
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:19.140]   to return back to those harvested eggs.
[02:47:19.140 --> 02:47:24.140]   So eggs are out and there's a collection of them frozen.
[02:47:24.140 --> 02:47:29.060]   Maybe, just maybe, lives, they're always alive, sorry.
[02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:31.440]   - I mean, they're not always alive.
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:32.680]   - The fresh sperm, they're not always alive.
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:35.440]   Some portion of the ejaculate is going to be dead sperm,
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:39.080]   right, some live, some for motile, some non-forward motile.
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:41.520]   The twitchers, I read, is the name.
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:42.360]   - I hate those twitchers.
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:47.360]   - Right, and so, okay, they're going to wash the sperm.
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:49.880]   Why, because, yeah, most of what people see as ejaculate
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:51.840]   or know, excuse me, as ejaculate,
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:54.720]   is not actually the sperm, right?
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:57.820]   Okay, so, but sperm are washed, they're in one compartment.
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:03.120]   You get the eggs out, you or your embryologist
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:05.500]   at your clinic is then going to, at some point,
[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:07.340]   decide to combine them.
[02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:09.620]   So is it kind of, is it a sperm race
[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:12.520]   or are you, maybe you could explain ICSI.
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:15.600]   And why would one want, why would one opt for ICSI?
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:17.360]   And is, are there any risks with ICSI?
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:20.560]   Because there, you're really, at some level,
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:22.600]   this is the only place where I kind of sit back and, okay,
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:24.920]   as somebody who, you know, is tight in neural development,
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:25.880]   like at some level, you're saying,
[02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:27.360]   hey, that sperm looks good.
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:29.920]   Whereas when you run a sperm race, nature is saying,
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:32.420]   hey, this sperm really did beat all the other sperm.
[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:35.420]   - So let's segue first, because I think this is nice,
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:37.160]   because the question I get asked all the time
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:41.760]   when we talk about nutrition and supplements and all of that
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:45.140]   is to, now you're doing IVF or you're freezing your eggs.
[02:48:45.140 --> 02:48:48.720]   And what if, what behaviors are good or bad?
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:50.560]   Of course, all of those same ones are,
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:52.400]   but about how long do you need to do them?
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.720]   And this is why if you live healthy most of the days,
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:56.920]   it doesn't really matter 'cause that's how you're living.
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:48:59.620]   But we already know the sperm cycle is about 90 days.
[02:48:59.620 --> 02:49:01.600]   And the eggs, I like to say,
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:03.620]   even though they're in the vault, they become,
[02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:06.260]   they start lining up, getting ready to exit the vault
[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:09.260]   and become more susceptible to the things you're doing
[02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:10.600]   in that 90 day window.
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:12.720]   And we know that to be true as well.
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:15.300]   So they start to be pre-selected
[02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:16.900]   for who's coming out the next month.
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:18.100]   They start to line up.
[02:49:18.100 --> 02:49:20.420]   And so making these changes
[02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:23.000]   as you start thinking about getting pregnant,
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.580]   doing fertility treatments, is still extremely beneficial.
[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:29.580]   People will often say, well, I haven't been doing that.
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:30.500]   So why start now?
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:31.700]   It's not gonna make a difference.
[02:49:31.700 --> 02:49:33.740]   But truly, it can.
[02:49:33.740 --> 02:49:35.300]   - Or I'll drink up until the week.
[02:49:35.300 --> 02:49:37.300]   - Until the day of, right?
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:39.300]   I'll just get it in the entire time.
[02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:41.140]   - Like I'm gonna have my two glasses of wine,
[02:49:41.140 --> 02:49:43.440]   which actually equates to about six glasses of wine
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:44.360]   when you measure out by-
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:45.200]   - How much it actually is.
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:46.380]   - By the volume, right.
[02:49:46.380 --> 02:49:48.960]   Right up until the week before getting pregnant
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:49.800]   or something like that.
[02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:50.800]   - Yeah, but no.
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:52.560]   So people always ask, what should I be doing?
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:53.660]   It's these healthy behaviors,
[02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:56.160]   and you should be doing them this whole time.
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:57.600]   When we do IVF,
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:49:59.100]   and I'm gonna get to all the things you just asked,
[02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:01.700]   but earlier you said, well, how tolerable is it?
[02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:04.760]   The truth is, you're taking shots.
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:07.560]   These are subcutaneous shots during the egg growth process.
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:08.400]   - So next to the belly button?
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:09.500]   - Yeah, next to the belly button,
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:12.480]   like how a diabetic gives insulin, a very small needle.
[02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:13.980]   I mean, nobody loves shots,
[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:16.620]   but they're not a big intramuscular shot.
[02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:18.840]   It's not like a flu shot or something like that.
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:21.180]   - Listen, I've been to Austin, the Texan mosquitoes-
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:22.020]   - They're way worse.
[02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:24.360]   - They hurt way worse than one of these needles.
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:25.200]   - Exactly.
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:27.180]   So you're gonna use those medications
[02:50:27.180 --> 02:50:29.060]   for about 12 to 14 days.
[02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:31.960]   You're going to have your follicles grow.
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:33.420]   You're going to feel that.
[02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:34.820]   So you're gonna have pelvic pressure.
[02:50:34.820 --> 02:50:35.980]   As your estrogen rises,
[02:50:35.980 --> 02:50:38.580]   you're also going to third space your fluid,
[02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:42.100]   which means your fluid, your water component of your blood
[02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:44.800]   is going to start to just eek out a little bit,
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:46.100]   and you're gonna get more bloated.
[02:50:46.100 --> 02:50:48.060]   You're gonna have more water, weight.
[02:50:48.060 --> 02:50:50.180]   You're going to feel puffier.
[02:50:50.180 --> 02:50:51.380]   And that is very common
[02:50:51.380 --> 02:50:53.620]   just because of getting the eggs to grow.
[02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:55.280]   You're gonna mentally be fine
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:57.460]   'cause the female brain loves high estrogen,
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:50:58.920]   so you're doing fine.
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:51:02.140]   That's one of the main concerns is how emotional will I be?
[02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:05.900]   And during this phase of the process, people do great.
[02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:07.140]   When we take the eggs out of the body,
[02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:09.140]   it's about a 20-minute procedure.
[02:51:09.140 --> 02:51:11.820]   It is usually done under IV sedation,
[02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:13.620]   like propofol and fentanyl.
[02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:16.460]   And we are watching while we drain those follicles
[02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:18.420]   and get test tubes full of the eggs.
[02:51:18.420 --> 02:51:21.440]   - Do some people opt to not use any?
[02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:22.500]   I hear the word fentanyl,
[02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:23.460]   and I'm sure a lot of people are like,
[02:51:23.460 --> 02:51:24.980]   "Wait, fentanyl crisis."
[02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:29.260]   And obviously, fentanyl is a drug that has its uses,
[02:51:29.260 --> 02:51:32.500]   valid uses in the medical community.
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:34.980]   Does anyone just kind of opt for just-
[02:51:34.980 --> 02:51:36.660]   - I mean, we have an anesthesiologist
[02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:38.300]   who is really talking to the patients.
[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:39.600]   I mean, propofol's the base of it.
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:40.600]   Certainly, there's some patients
[02:51:40.600 --> 02:51:42.700]   who may want to avoid narcotic usage,
[02:51:42.700 --> 02:51:44.500]   and they use different strategies.
[02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:46.220]   I mean, there was this huge, right?
[02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:49.160]   The Retrievals podcast came out from the New York Times
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:52.420]   doing a deep dive into a fertility clinic, Yale,
[02:51:52.420 --> 02:51:55.140]   where a nurse was siphoning off fentanyl.
[02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:56.540]   - For herself. - For herself,
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:51:59.880]   and replacing it with saline and giving patients saline.
[02:51:59.880 --> 02:52:04.340]   This clinic did not do anesthesia-based propofol,
[02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:06.500]   so they were supposed to just get fentanyl
[02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:09.140]   and have kind of a less pain environment,
[02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:13.060]   not a no pain environment, and not just a few,
[02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:15.380]   hundreds of women reported extreme pain,
[02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:17.380]   extreme pain through the procedure,
[02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:21.440]   really speaks largely to pain not being taken seriously
[02:52:21.440 --> 02:52:22.860]   when they went and found this out.
[02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:24.540]   - Whoa, what happened to, I can't help but ask,
[02:52:24.540 --> 02:52:26.900]   what happened to this technician?
[02:52:26.900 --> 02:52:27.740]   - Well, I mean-
[02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:30.900]   - Yeah, they're trying to find fentanyl behind bars.
[02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:33.860]   - Yeah, I mean, but it's huge as far as to,
[02:52:33.860 --> 02:52:37.140]   like, I mean, I can't imagine doing,
[02:52:37.140 --> 02:52:39.620]   I do this procedure like all the time, right?
[02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:41.820]   I've done thousands and thousands in my career,
[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:45.380]   and I can't imagine having people be in pain during it.
[02:52:45.380 --> 02:52:46.740]   So it's, but it's important to know
[02:52:46.740 --> 02:52:49.700]   that some clinics don't use IV sedation
[02:52:49.700 --> 02:52:52.180]   or they don't use propofol, they don't put you to sleep.
[02:52:52.180 --> 02:52:54.140]   Understanding what your clinic is using
[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:57.500]   is really, really important to set the expectations
[02:52:57.500 --> 02:52:59.240]   or to know, am I going to be awake
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:00.580]   or am I going to be asleep?
[02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:03.180]   - Can a patient ask you to what specific drugs
[02:53:03.180 --> 02:53:04.260]   are you going to give me to kill pain?
[02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:08.120]   - For sure, and I mean, some clinics only do one.
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:12.880]   Like, I am not going to do a retrieval under no sedation.
[02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:14.700]   Now, some clinics would allow that,
[02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:16.800]   some clinics, that's all that they do,
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:18.380]   but you, that's a huge piece of the puzzle
[02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:19.260]   that you need to know.
[02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:21.900]   If you're a patient, are you going to be feeling pain,
[02:53:21.900 --> 02:53:24.660]   not feeling pain, what's it going to be like?
[02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:27.240]   I'll say most clinics use propofol
[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:28.580]   and put patients to sleep.
[02:53:28.580 --> 02:53:32.180]   And so you take a nice little nap for 15 to 20 minutes,
[02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:34.700]   the eggs are retrieved from the follicles
[02:53:34.700 --> 02:53:38.180]   under direct visualization, they're in test tubes,
[02:53:38.180 --> 02:53:41.380]   you wake up and you're going to feel crampy
[02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:44.300]   and you'll get a period 10-ish days later,
[02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:46.180]   but this is when you'll feel your worst
[02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:47.340]   and this is just the one thing I want to say
[02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:48.740]   about tolerability of it.
[02:53:48.740 --> 02:53:50.320]   - Can you get pregnant in that time?
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:51.160]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:53.280]   There's a case report of an egg donor
[02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:57.620]   who was donating her eggs and she had sex with her boyfriend
[02:53:57.620 --> 02:53:59.900]   and because not every egg is always retrieved
[02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:02.100]   from the follicles or some small ones,
[02:54:02.100 --> 02:54:05.740]   could ovulate too and she got pregnant with quintuplets.
[02:54:05.740 --> 02:54:06.920]   - Whoa.
[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:08.220]   - Okay, so you have to really tell people
[02:54:08.220 --> 02:54:11.100]   not to have intercourse, one from an infectious standpoint
[02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:14.220]   'cause we really are poking a pretty large gauge needle
[02:54:14.220 --> 02:54:16.840]   through the vaginal mucosa into the peritoneal cavity,
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:18.240]   so we don't want to introduce infection,
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:21.340]   but also for pregnancy in that time period
[02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:24.180]   and if you got pregnant, your risk of what we call
[02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:29.180]   ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or OHSS is very profound.
[02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:32.780]   So what is normally happening is after the retrieval,
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:34.740]   your estrogen and progesterone are gonna drop,
[02:54:34.740 --> 02:54:38.340]   you're gonna feel a severe PMS for lack of a better word,
[02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:39.740]   so when you'll be more emotional,
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:42.660]   you're still pretty bloated until this all heals.
[02:54:42.660 --> 02:54:47.660]   If you get OHSS, which is very uncommon in modern practice,
[02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:50.340]   but when you did fresh embryo transfers
[02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:53.300]   or people who don't utilize some of the modern protocols,
[02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:58.120]   this means that HCG continues to encourage
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:00.620]   all those follicles to make estrogen and progesterone
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:03.140]   and if you are pregnant, you're just gonna have
[02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:06.900]   a constant yet exponential increase in HCG
[02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:10.440]   and so this is going to get worse and worse.
[02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:12.660]   So we really don't want people to get pregnant
[02:55:12.660 --> 02:55:13.500]   in that time period.
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:16.540]   - So when during that time period should they avoid sex?
[02:55:16.540 --> 02:55:20.080]   So is it in the few days before the extraction?
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:23.260]   - So typically, I usually say it's from like day five
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:27.340]   of your stimulation, okay, so usually the earliest
[02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:30.000]   egg retrievals are kind of around cycle day nine or 10
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:34.260]   if somebody goes fast until your next period comes.
[02:55:34.260 --> 02:55:36.280]   So that's usually about a three week time period
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:38.580]   where we want you to abstain from intercourse.
[02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:43.080]   So for the most part though, the more eggs you have,
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:44.980]   the more you're gonna feel both this hormonal
[02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:47.700]   and physical shift than the fewer eggs that you have.
[02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:51.220]   So if you have a low egg count and you need to do IVF
[02:55:51.220 --> 02:55:53.880]   or freeze your eggs and you might do multiple cycles
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:56.840]   or rounds, you're gonna tolerate it actually pretty fine
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:58.500]   because you're not gonna have these huge shifts.
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:56:00.160]   Physically, you're gonna feel fine
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.960]   and that's always a big concern.
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:05.200]   When you mentioned earlier about different stimulation
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:09.040]   types, people have this idea that things that are more
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:12.960]   natural are better, right, just like this human thought
[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:17.440]   that natural is good and synthetic is bad.
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:20.140]   Naturally, you ovulate one egg a month.
[02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:22.440]   When we're trying to get eggs out of your body,
[02:56:22.440 --> 02:56:26.720]   the success is determined by how many eggs I can get
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:28.780]   and how young you are.
[02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:32.660]   So it doesn't make sense in most circumstances
[02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:35.360]   to do a minimal stimulation protocol,
[02:56:35.360 --> 02:56:38.520]   meaning purposefully understimulating somebody
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:41.440]   by saving them money and medication costs
[02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:44.400]   in order to purposely get fewer eggs
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:47.400]   because their odds of getting the ultimate success
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:50.680]   of what they want is going to be so much lower.
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:53.680]   - Is there, I don't want you to be in the position of,
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:56.360]   I don't wanna put you rather in the position of
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:59.240]   kind of like having to demonize your colleagues
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:01.360]   in your profession, but I could see how there's a pretty
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:03.120]   significant financial incentive for people
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:05.040]   who are really desperate to have children
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:06.640]   or who just simply might want to have children
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:10.280]   down the road to, they hear low stim is better.
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:12.080]   We're talking multiple low stim cycles.
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:14.880]   They might be even a fraction of the cost
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:16.400]   of a full stim cycle, but then there are many,
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.960]   many more low stim cycles. - You got it.
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:19.800]   You got it.
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:22.320]   You can make a lot more money by doing things
[02:57:22.320 --> 02:57:24.600]   that are not in the best interest of the patient.
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:26.920]   And I mean, that's not uncommon in my field,
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:29.600]   which is very sad, but it does mean that because
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:32.680]   reproduction and IVF are so foreign and unknown,
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:36.440]   so many people walk in blind, not knowing
[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:38.840]   if what they're being told really makes sense
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:40.960]   for their situation.
[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:43.320]   There are a couple situations where minimal stimulation
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:44.160]   makes sense.
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:45.440]   If you're only gonna make three eggs,
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:46.880]   you're only gonna make three eggs.
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:49.040]   I don't need all the drugs in the world
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:50.680]   to tell your body to make three eggs
[02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:51.920]   'cause there's only three.
[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:54.840]   And so that is a scenario where minimal stimulation
[02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:56.040]   does make sense.
[02:57:56.040 --> 02:57:58.640]   And then there's the scenario where,
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:00.000]   there's something called InvoCell.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.400]   Has your research exposed you to this?
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:03.240]   - No.
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:06.520]   - InvoCell is a way to try to take IVF
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:09.720]   into making it more financially accessible
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:11.880]   for certain patient populations,
[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:14.520]   mainly people who don't ovulate,
[02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:16.840]   like your very refractory PCOS patient
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:18.800]   who doesn't respond to medication,
[02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:20.960]   or who have tubal factor infertility, right?
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:22.480]   So your fallopian tubes are blocked
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:26.240]   because of chlamydia or endometriosis.
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:28.520]   And we just have a problem here
[02:58:28.520 --> 02:58:30.120]   that egg and sperm can't get together
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:33.480]   'cause you're not ovulating or your tubes are blocked.
[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:37.720]   And InvoCell, it's a device that is plastic.
[02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:41.600]   And you can fit up to 10 eggs in it.
[02:58:41.600 --> 02:58:44.280]   And there's a little middle chamber where the sperm can go.
[02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:46.200]   And so you go through this IVF process
[02:58:46.200 --> 02:58:48.360]   with the goal to only get eight to 10 eggs
[02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:50.320]   'cause that's what fits in the device.
[02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:52.440]   And then you put the sperm in the middle of it.
[02:58:52.440 --> 02:58:55.440]   And then you put it inside your vagina
[02:58:55.440 --> 02:58:57.760]   and you hold it in place with a diaphragm.
[02:58:57.760 --> 02:59:01.160]   And the vagina is the right temperature to incubate.
[02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:04.000]   And so you incubate your embryos
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:08.360]   in this little InvoCell container inside your vagina.
[02:59:08.360 --> 02:59:10.640]   And then five days later, you come in and we take it out
[02:59:10.640 --> 02:59:13.080]   and we take the best embryo and we transfer it.
[02:59:13.080 --> 02:59:15.140]   And you can do a fresh transfer
[02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:17.240]   because you didn't make so many eggs
[02:59:17.240 --> 02:59:19.480]   so your hormones weren't so high.
[02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:20.720]   - Do people like this procedure?
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:23.040]   There's something that seems like staying in proximity
[02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:25.600]   to the sperm and egg, like you're taking it home.
[02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:28.800]   - Okay, so I love this procedure in some circumstances
[02:59:28.800 --> 02:59:31.760]   and I see it applied often in the wrong case
[02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:32.960]   and that can be frustrating, right?
[02:59:32.960 --> 02:59:34.040]   'Cause it's still not cheap.
[02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:36.920]   Even if it's cheaper than IVF,
[02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:40.240]   it is still not inexpensive in any means.
[02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:43.680]   And so patient selection, like most things in this field
[02:59:43.680 --> 02:59:45.000]   are so important.
[02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.700]   So let's just say, if you've had no,
[02:59:47.700 --> 02:59:50.000]   like if the sperm's the problem,
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.800]   then it's probably not smart to just presume
[02:59:53.800 --> 02:59:56.000]   that the sperm and egg will be fine in there, right?
[02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.340]   Like that might be a case where you really do need help
[02:59:58.340 --> 03:00:00.200]   with assisted fertilization
[03:00:00.200 --> 03:00:02.200]   or if you have unexplained infertility.
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:04.880]   If we don't know why you haven't been able to get pregnant
[03:00:04.880 --> 03:00:06.900]   because everything looks good on paper,
[03:00:06.900 --> 03:00:08.640]   what if fertilization is the issue?
[03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:11.160]   And these are circumstances where you pull out an InvoCell
[03:00:11.160 --> 03:00:12.440]   and there's no embryos
[03:00:12.440 --> 03:00:14.960]   and you don't really know where it went wrong.
[03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:16.760]   Was it the fertilization step?
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:19.640]   Was it the growth step of the embryos in culture?
[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:21.420]   So you do have less data.
[03:00:21.420 --> 03:00:23.060]   Notably, I like data.
[03:00:23.060 --> 03:00:24.960]   You can't do genetic testing
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:26.220]   and this isn't really a strategy
[03:00:26.220 --> 03:00:29.620]   that allows you to freeze embryos for future family growth.
[03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:32.100]   That being said, the young patient
[03:00:32.100 --> 03:00:33.620]   who's got great egg quality,
[03:00:33.620 --> 03:00:36.600]   who might have really bad PCOS or tubal disease,
[03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:39.240]   it can certainly allow them the opportunity
[03:00:39.240 --> 03:00:41.840]   for a child at a lower price point
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:43.960]   when they still have many reproductive years
[03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:45.880]   to finalize their family.
[03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:48.240]   It also is a lovely option
[03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:50.480]   for people who need donor sperm to conceive
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:52.160]   because the success rates with this
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:54.400]   are so much higher than an IUI,
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:56.460]   which is what a lot of people use,
[03:00:56.460 --> 03:00:57.900]   an intrauterine insemination
[03:00:57.900 --> 03:00:59.820]   or putting the sperm in the uterus.
[03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:03.700]   So now we're able to improve this outcome.
[03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:05.280]   So like our same-sex couples
[03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:07.420]   or our single parents by choice,
[03:01:07.420 --> 03:01:10.440]   if it's a single woman who's trying to become a parent,
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:11.920]   then they need to buy donor sperm
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:13.740]   and go through the process anyway.
[03:01:13.740 --> 03:01:18.040]   This often can improve that efficacy through the process,
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:20.600]   pending their age and other factors.
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:22.860]   There was a study that was just really neat.
[03:01:22.860 --> 03:01:23.860]   There was a lesbian couple,
[03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:28.380]   and one of them, the eggs came out of,
[03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:31.960]   and the other one incubated the embryos,
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:34.220]   and then the other one had the embryo transfer.
[03:01:34.220 --> 03:01:35.740]   So but it gave both partners
[03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:38.320]   a way to feel a little more involved in the process,
[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:40.940]   which I just think is always a really cool way
[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:43.100]   when you have these different options with reproduction.
[03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:46.100]   - Seems also that it's a more
[03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:47.500]   of a three-dimensional environment.
[03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:51.140]   Like I always imagined that the Petri dish approach
[03:01:51.140 --> 03:01:53.380]   is so two-dimensional compared to the body,
[03:01:53.380 --> 03:01:55.440]   and all these things that having done cell culture before
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:01:57.220]   and cultured neurons and things of that sort,
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:01:58.780]   like there's all these concerns
[03:01:58.780 --> 03:02:00.860]   about like the concentration of CO2 and the thing,
[03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:04.540]   or God forbid if there's a fluctuation
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:06.640]   and you have backup generators and things,
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:08.940]   but in the electrical flow to the incubators,
[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:09.780]   that's disruptive.
[03:02:09.780 --> 03:02:11.780]   Whereas the natural environment of the body,
[03:02:11.780 --> 03:02:13.700]   even though it fluctuates in temperature,
[03:02:13.700 --> 03:02:16.300]   it's, I mean, this has evolved over tens of thousands,
[03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:18.220]   if not hundreds of thousands of years
[03:02:18.220 --> 03:02:20.700]   to be the process by which embryos are created.
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:24.980]   So here's where I sort of default in my mind anyway
[03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:26.980]   to the kind of like, oh, like it seems more natural.
[03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:28.420]   You're incubating in the quote-unquote
[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:29.540]   more natural environment.
[03:02:29.540 --> 03:02:34.200]   - But at the same breath, why are you having infertility
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:36.620]   if you're an infertility patient, right?
[03:02:36.620 --> 03:02:39.260]   So if you need donor sperm,
[03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:40.720]   you maybe don't have infertility,
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:42.100]   or if you have tubal disease,
[03:02:42.100 --> 03:02:45.660]   you have a very defined reason why we don't think
[03:02:45.660 --> 03:02:49.640]   that there's this huge inflammatory issue in your body
[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:51.500]   or something unknown.
[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:54.020]   So again, I'll see it applied to people
[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:56.940]   who really are bad candidates for it based on their age
[03:02:56.940 --> 03:02:59.220]   or based on their diagnosis.
[03:02:59.220 --> 03:03:03.100]   And so it's not always better, but for the right patient,
[03:03:03.100 --> 03:03:04.640]   I mean, I've had patients have babies that way
[03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:06.500]   who otherwise may not be able to.
[03:03:06.500 --> 03:03:08.380]   So it can really open up the door.
[03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:12.480]   So that's the most minimal of the minimal stimulation, right?
[03:03:12.480 --> 03:03:13.720]   Then we have minimal stimulation
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:15.200]   because you don't have many eggs.
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:16.820]   So we don't really need that.
[03:03:16.820 --> 03:03:18.780]   But for the vast majority of people
[03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:20.760]   who go through egg freezing or IVF,
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:22.420]   we are really trying to get as many eggs
[03:03:22.420 --> 03:03:24.440]   as you potentially have.
[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:27.260]   Everybody has a different number, but whatever you have,
[03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:29.700]   whatever that antral follicle count is for you
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:31.000]   is what we're trying to get.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.040]   And that's what these combination of medications
[03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:34.660]   is trying to do.
[03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:39.220]   When the eggs come into the lab, if you have egg freezing,
[03:03:39.220 --> 03:03:40.060]   very important to know
[03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:41.960]   is before we get into the ICSI discussion,
[03:03:41.960 --> 03:03:43.980]   the eggs are stripped of their outer cells,
[03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:45.060]   which is called the cumulus.
[03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:46.860]   That's what the sperm has to attach to
[03:03:46.860 --> 03:03:48.420]   in order to fertilize.
[03:03:48.420 --> 03:03:49.700]   In order to freeze the eggs,
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:52.020]   those cumulus cells are stripped off, the eggs are frozen.
[03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:53.380]   You have to do ICSI.
[03:03:53.380 --> 03:03:56.580]   So if we're gonna lead into this ICSI conversation,
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:03:57.980]   if you're freezing your eggs,
[03:03:57.980 --> 03:04:00.820]   you're having ICSI when you fertilize them.
[03:04:00.820 --> 03:04:04.500]   So I don't want somebody to ever not know that
[03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:06.460]   if that is what they are choosing.
[03:04:06.460 --> 03:04:08.100]   - And ICSI is, you can tell us?
[03:04:08.100 --> 03:04:10.700]   - Yes, ICSI stands for its ICSI,
[03:04:10.700 --> 03:04:13.560]   or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:16.240]   It is taking a sperm that under the microscope
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:19.140]   looks normal in shape and moves well,
[03:04:19.140 --> 03:04:22.840]   and you're pulling it up into a little needle.
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:26.320]   And you're essentially using a little laser
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:29.000]   on the side of the egg or the zona pellucida of the egg,
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.700]   and you're injecting that one sperm
[03:04:31.700 --> 03:04:33.180]   into that egg cytoplasm.
[03:04:33.180 --> 03:04:34.620]   - And you're picking that sperm
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:37.540]   on the basis of shape, motility.
[03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:38.740]   You're picking what you think
[03:04:38.740 --> 03:04:40.780]   is the best sperm in the batch, obviously.
[03:04:40.780 --> 03:04:41.620]   - Yeah, you're picking,
[03:04:41.620 --> 03:04:42.820]   I mean, there's gonna be one sperm per egg,
[03:04:42.820 --> 03:04:45.060]   so there's multiple sperm that are chosen,
[03:04:45.060 --> 03:04:45.900]   but you're picking sperm
[03:04:45.900 --> 03:04:47.660]   that look like they have the highest potential.
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:50.020]   - My understanding is that there's a range
[03:04:50.020 --> 03:04:51.900]   from very low to potentially high,
[03:04:51.900 --> 03:04:54.100]   but hopefully not high, of DNA fragmentation
[03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:55.380]   in pretty much every cell of the body.
[03:04:55.380 --> 03:04:58.160]   Like the cell is always repairing its DNA.
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:05:02.820]   So when visually selecting a sperm for ICSI,
[03:05:02.820 --> 03:05:05.220]   it's based on morphology, shape, and motility.
[03:05:05.220 --> 03:05:07.180]   - Right, you can't see the DNA damage
[03:05:07.180 --> 03:05:09.700]   inside the head of the sperm or the DNA itself.
[03:05:09.700 --> 03:05:10.960]   - Are we soon to have a technology
[03:05:10.960 --> 03:05:13.520]   where you could actually get a dye
[03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:17.120]   that could label DNA fragmentation and select?
[03:05:17.120 --> 03:05:19.500]   Because I feel like when we talk about embryology,
[03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:20.800]   not to get too far down in the weeds,
[03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:25.800]   but the methods of selecting eggs and selecting sperm,
[03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:28.080]   I mean, these are the same methods
[03:05:28.080 --> 03:05:30.620]   that have been used in embryology since the 1930s.
[03:05:30.620 --> 03:05:32.560]   Like, oh, this one looks good, that one looks good.
[03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:35.040]   And the skilled embryologists can really develop
[03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:38.660]   a real talent over time of knowing what correlated
[03:05:38.660 --> 03:05:41.220]   with healthy pregnancy and an offspring.
[03:05:41.220 --> 03:05:42.700]   But I do like technology.
[03:05:42.700 --> 03:05:44.840]   You would think that by now, 2023,
[03:05:44.840 --> 03:05:46.080]   that someone would have some dye
[03:05:46.080 --> 03:05:47.440]   that you could drop on the sperm and go,
[03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:49.940]   well, that one has a lot of DNA fragmentation
[03:05:49.940 --> 03:05:51.040]   and that one doesn't. - I know, right?
[03:05:51.040 --> 03:05:53.640]   There should be better ways to choose which sperm.
[03:05:53.640 --> 03:05:56.120]   There's definitely, people are trying things.
[03:05:56.120 --> 03:05:58.560]   Nothing has proven to be helpful so far.
[03:05:58.560 --> 03:06:00.760]   There's definitely some interest in this
[03:06:00.760 --> 03:06:03.200]   because we're starting to get more insight
[03:06:03.200 --> 03:06:06.320]   as we have become better at embryo culture,
[03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:09.720]   getting embryos to grow, doing genetic testing on embryos
[03:06:09.720 --> 03:06:12.640]   to understand that that male genome kicks in at day three.
[03:06:12.640 --> 03:06:14.020]   And there's a subset of people
[03:06:14.020 --> 03:06:17.680]   who have beautiful fertilization and embryo growth,
[03:06:17.680 --> 03:06:20.040]   day zero to three, and that's all on the egg.
[03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:22.360]   And then as soon as that male genome kicks in,
[03:06:22.360 --> 03:06:25.880]   you have this huge drop-off in your embryo number.
[03:06:25.880 --> 03:06:28.400]   And even some of this is in the context
[03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:31.080]   of normal sperm parameters, right?
[03:06:31.080 --> 03:06:33.920]   So things aren't really normal though,
[03:06:33.920 --> 03:06:35.920]   or there's something underlying it.
[03:06:35.920 --> 03:06:37.780]   - Does that mean that every embryo failure
[03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:39.480]   on day three post-fertilization is sperm-based?
[03:06:39.480 --> 03:06:42.060]   - No, of course not, but it definitely means
[03:06:42.060 --> 03:06:45.440]   that none of the ones before that can be blamed on the sperm
[03:06:45.440 --> 03:06:48.000]   and ones after that, there's definitely still maternal
[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:49.480]   and sperm contributions.
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:53.760]   - We don't want to create any couple disputes around this.
[03:06:53.760 --> 03:06:55.200]   - But it can be an insight
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:06:58.200]   when you're trying to look through somebody's IVF cycle
[03:06:58.200 --> 03:07:01.520]   about potentially modifiable factors, right?
[03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:04.640]   Can you improve sperm quality
[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:06.580]   by some of these lifestyle measures?
[03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:07.760]   I mean, the debatable thing
[03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:10.220]   about a DNA sperm fragmentation, so what is that?
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:12.480]   It is not a normal semen analysis,
[03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:16.140]   but it is like that as far as it's a sperm sample
[03:07:16.140 --> 03:07:18.360]   that is then sent off to be evaluated,
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:21.280]   how much fragmentation or abnormal DNA
[03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:23.420]   is in the heads of those sperm.
[03:07:23.420 --> 03:07:25.220]   The studies have shown that people
[03:07:25.220 --> 03:07:28.700]   who have abnormal DNA sperm fragmentation should do ICSI.
[03:07:28.700 --> 03:07:30.680]   Okay, that's like the point of the study.
[03:07:30.680 --> 03:07:34.080]   Now, ICSI has become very commonplace.
[03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:38.180]   So ICSI, choosing the sperm to put into the egg
[03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:40.320]   originally didn't exist, right?
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:42.300]   So what's the alternative?
[03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:43.800]   Conventional fertilization.
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:46.580]   This is having your petri dish, your eggs are on it,
[03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:48.580]   you scorch your sperm, you cover it up,
[03:07:48.580 --> 03:07:49.660]   you put it in the incubator.
[03:07:49.660 --> 03:07:51.060]   - Guys, she didn't mean you squirt your sperm.
[03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:52.940]   She meant the embryologist.
[03:07:52.940 --> 03:07:55.200]   - The embryologist squirts the sperm on top.
[03:07:55.200 --> 03:07:56.040]   - Just to be clear, just to be clear.
[03:07:56.040 --> 03:07:58.460]   - And then pulls it out, and the next day sees
[03:07:58.460 --> 03:08:02.360]   by which eggs and sperm fertilized.
[03:08:02.360 --> 03:08:06.540]   Well, it's really devastating to pull out the dish
[03:08:06.540 --> 03:08:08.180]   and have no fertilization,
[03:08:08.180 --> 03:08:11.740]   and it definitely is a cause of infertility,
[03:08:11.740 --> 03:08:14.140]   and it can be very hard to know that
[03:08:14.140 --> 03:08:16.340]   because fertilization is not challenged
[03:08:16.340 --> 03:08:19.380]   on a cellular level until you challenge it.
[03:08:19.380 --> 03:08:22.580]   So ICSI used to be an add-on cost.
[03:08:22.580 --> 03:08:24.900]   It used to be a separate thing
[03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:27.260]   because it was harder to find embryologists who could do it.
[03:08:27.260 --> 03:08:29.180]   It's so standard that a lot of clinics do it
[03:08:29.180 --> 03:08:31.020]   the majority of the time,
[03:08:31.020 --> 03:08:33.780]   purely because you often don't know all the variables
[03:08:33.780 --> 03:08:35.780]   that are impacting fertilization,
[03:08:35.780 --> 03:08:37.340]   and you're trying to give somebody
[03:08:37.340 --> 03:08:39.940]   as many opportunities as possible.
[03:08:39.940 --> 03:08:44.880]   ICSI has, in a lot of those original IVF studies,
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:47.920]   got some of the bad reputation of being the problem
[03:08:47.920 --> 03:08:51.180]   with why you might see that 1% rise of birth defects.
[03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:54.420]   And so ICSI took the brunt from a lot of that.
[03:08:54.420 --> 03:08:57.780]   We really don't see that when we're growing out
[03:08:57.780 --> 03:08:59.900]   and we're doing, freezing the embryos,
[03:08:59.900 --> 03:09:02.060]   doing frozen transfers.
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:05.060]   And I mean, I do ICSI in almost every patient.
[03:09:05.060 --> 03:09:06.220]   I'm not gonna say in every one, but--
[03:09:06.220 --> 03:09:07.860]   - Higher probability of success, right?
[03:09:07.860 --> 03:09:08.700]   - Higher probability of success.
[03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:10.420]   So when you get to this point,
[03:09:10.420 --> 03:09:13.220]   and so few people have insurance coverage,
[03:09:13.220 --> 03:09:15.480]   so they're spending their money,
[03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:16.580]   they're getting second mortgages,
[03:09:16.580 --> 03:09:17.980]   they're taking out loans.
[03:09:17.980 --> 03:09:20.420]   If there's one decision that you say,
[03:09:20.420 --> 03:09:23.700]   well, I don't know, you could have zero eggs fertilized,
[03:09:23.700 --> 03:09:26.620]   or I could have the embryologist pick the best sperm
[03:09:26.620 --> 03:09:27.860]   and put them inside the egg,
[03:09:27.860 --> 03:09:31.160]   and we expect a 75% chance of fertilization,
[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:33.580]   that makes sense for the majority of people.
[03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:35.520]   - Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[03:09:35.520 --> 03:09:38.780]   Because I'm obsessed with data
[03:09:38.780 --> 03:09:40.900]   and do blood work fairly regularly,
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:44.160]   not obsessively, but twice a year or so.
[03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:45.340]   Now, I didn't always do that.
[03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:48.180]   And I actually did one of these DNA fragmentation tests.
[03:09:48.180 --> 03:09:49.580]   They're pretty expensive.
[03:09:49.580 --> 03:09:50.420]   You know, they're in the--
[03:09:50.420 --> 03:09:51.260]   - They're far more than a semen analysis.
[03:09:51.260 --> 03:09:55.460]   - Yeah, they're in the low, they're sort of $1,200, $1,500
[03:09:55.460 --> 03:09:57.380]   or so, at least the one that I did.
[03:09:57.380 --> 03:09:58.340]   It was very informative.
[03:09:58.340 --> 03:09:59.940]   Like I was relieved to see
[03:09:59.940 --> 03:10:02.620]   not abnormal levels of DNA fragmentation.
[03:10:02.620 --> 03:10:05.500]   But I will say that based on everything you just said,
[03:10:05.500 --> 03:10:07.800]   it seems like it might be the lower cost option
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:11.840]   because the alternative is to go through repeated cycles
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:12.980]   of IVF and it's failing,
[03:10:12.980 --> 03:10:14.780]   and that's certainly much more expensive.
[03:10:14.780 --> 03:10:15.820]   - It is.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:19.220]   And I mean, I will say that there is some current thought
[03:10:19.220 --> 03:10:20.660]   by my urology colleagues, right?
[03:10:20.660 --> 03:10:22.900]   So I'm not a urologist,
[03:10:22.900 --> 03:10:24.580]   but definitely when I have a male
[03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:26.740]   who needs a sperm extraction,
[03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:28.260]   maybe he's had a prior vasectomy,
[03:10:28.260 --> 03:10:30.020]   maybe he's got very low sperm counts,
[03:10:30.020 --> 03:10:31.000]   and we're going and we're doing
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:32.900]   a sperm extraction procedure,
[03:10:32.900 --> 03:10:35.820]   that potentially if you have a patient
[03:10:35.820 --> 03:10:38.160]   who has an abnormal DNA sperm fragmentation,
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:41.600]   and even with ICSI has this drop-off in embryo growth
[03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:43.060]   after day three,
[03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:45.820]   because the sperm are still being made the same way,
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:47.500]   right, are they still fragmented,
[03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:49.940]   that potentially the ejaculatory process
[03:10:49.940 --> 03:10:53.580]   could cause some of that fragmentation in certain men,
[03:10:53.580 --> 03:10:56.060]   and by going in and doing a sperm extraction
[03:10:56.060 --> 03:10:59.220]   and not subjecting those sperm
[03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:02.500]   to the rigors of ejaculation, for lack of a better word,
[03:11:02.500 --> 03:11:06.060]   could potentially lessen the fragmentation
[03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:07.020]   and improve outcomes.
[03:11:07.020 --> 03:11:09.260]   And I have some patients who,
[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:11.540]   we've gone down that road and that has helped them,
[03:11:11.540 --> 03:11:12.720]   clear to say there's not a study,
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:15.100]   that's not the point of DNA sperm frag,
[03:11:15.100 --> 03:11:17.500]   is to try to distinguish if potentially ICSI
[03:11:17.500 --> 03:11:19.260]   could be a helpful technology,
[03:11:19.260 --> 03:11:23.060]   but a lot of doctors are offering or doing ICSI
[03:11:23.060 --> 03:11:26.540]   because we want you to fertilize your eggs.
[03:11:26.540 --> 03:11:28.460]   When they grow it in culture,
[03:11:28.460 --> 03:11:30.540]   as we talked about IVF changing,
[03:11:30.540 --> 03:11:32.260]   the metabolic needs of the embryo
[03:11:32.260 --> 03:11:33.740]   change throughout the process,
[03:11:33.740 --> 03:11:36.640]   and so embryo culture has become so much more successful,
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:38.820]   but even in those best case scenarios,
[03:11:38.820 --> 03:11:40.540]   we're looking at 50% progression.
[03:11:40.540 --> 03:11:43.940]   So you're gonna have loss throughout that culture process
[03:11:43.940 --> 03:11:45.140]   no matter what.
[03:11:45.140 --> 03:11:46.560]   - And you said 50% progression,
[03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:49.020]   so half of the fertilized embryos that make it past eight,
[03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:50.460]   let's say day seven,
[03:11:50.460 --> 03:11:52.700]   then they're screened for chromosomal abnormalities.
[03:11:52.700 --> 03:11:54.220]   So then, okay, then you've got,
[03:11:54.220 --> 03:11:56.100]   let's say two or three of those, maybe four,
[03:11:56.100 --> 03:11:57.600]   depending on how many eggs were harvested.
[03:11:57.600 --> 03:11:58.440]   - And your age.
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:00.140]   - And age, yes, thank you.
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:04.260]   And then you said of those that are implanted into,
[03:12:04.260 --> 03:12:06.900]   let's say a woman, you're 45 or younger,
[03:12:06.900 --> 03:12:10.620]   you're looking at about anywhere from 30 to 65%
[03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:12.340]   successful implantation and pregnancy,
[03:12:12.340 --> 03:12:13.780]   like healthy baby.
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:15.720]   - It's usually a 65% chance of live birth
[03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:18.340]   if it's a genetically tested embryo.
[03:12:18.340 --> 03:12:19.540]   That asterisk is the if,
[03:12:19.540 --> 03:12:20.380]   and that's why you're gonna see
[03:12:20.380 --> 03:12:22.480]   such varying IVF success rates,
[03:12:22.480 --> 03:12:25.300]   because if you don't do genetic testing of embryos,
[03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:29.100]   let's use the 40-year-old who makes four embryos,
[03:12:29.100 --> 03:12:31.060]   and I send them off for genetic testing.
[03:12:31.060 --> 03:12:33.860]   I anticipate she has one normal embryo.
[03:12:33.860 --> 03:12:36.140]   If I do genetic testing, which takes,
[03:12:36.140 --> 03:12:39.140]   it's called PGT, pre-implantation genetic testing,
[03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:42.380]   I am testing for aneuploidy as the traditional testing,
[03:12:42.380 --> 03:12:44.660]   meaning does it have the right number of chromosomes?
[03:12:44.660 --> 03:12:47.540]   You can also importantly test for single gene disorders
[03:12:47.540 --> 03:12:50.100]   like cystic fibrosis or Huntington's.
[03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:52.920]   But if we're just doing PGT for aneuploidy,
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:55.260]   I expect an age-related proportion of your eggs
[03:12:55.260 --> 03:12:56.580]   to be normal or abnormal.
[03:12:56.580 --> 03:13:00.580]   So at age 40, I expect 20 to 25% normal.
[03:13:00.580 --> 03:13:02.940]   So I can choose that one and put it in you
[03:13:02.940 --> 03:13:05.800]   and have a 65% chance that you have a baby.
[03:13:05.800 --> 03:13:07.420]   I could not do it.
[03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:08.820]   I still have the same four.
[03:13:08.820 --> 03:13:10.420]   That one is in there.
[03:13:10.420 --> 03:13:12.960]   But if I go and transfer them each independently,
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:16.580]   I'm now gonna have closer to a 20 to 30% chance of success.
[03:13:16.580 --> 03:13:20.540]   So it is not that I'm changing the embryo by testing it,
[03:13:20.540 --> 03:13:24.500]   but I'm allowing myself to have higher utility of success,
[03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:25.860]   higher efficiency,
[03:13:25.860 --> 03:13:28.580]   putting somebody through less failed transfers,
[03:13:28.580 --> 03:13:31.700]   which is extremely important and less miscarriages
[03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:33.820]   because those also take time.
[03:13:33.820 --> 03:13:36.100]   And one of the most important things
[03:13:36.100 --> 03:13:38.180]   is that you have the opportunity to understand
[03:13:38.180 --> 03:13:42.260]   how many potential normal embryos you have in batch cycles.
[03:13:42.260 --> 03:13:45.580]   So you could go into another cycle because I'm 40,
[03:13:45.580 --> 03:13:48.280]   I just met my person, I really wanna have two kids
[03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:51.140]   because my sibling is really important in my life,
[03:13:51.140 --> 03:13:54.700]   yet naturally by the age I would be for that second child,
[03:13:54.700 --> 03:13:57.060]   it's gonna be very hard to conceive.
[03:13:57.060 --> 03:14:01.040]   I can go through IVF and batch some embryos.
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:04.420]   So I could save two or three for that second baby
[03:14:04.420 --> 03:14:07.180]   that I'm not gonna transfer for a few years.
[03:14:07.180 --> 03:14:08.740]   And that's called embryo banking.
[03:14:08.740 --> 03:14:11.220]   And that is changing the ways
[03:14:11.220 --> 03:14:14.640]   that people can potentially grow their family at later ages.
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:15.760]   But you don't know that
[03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:17.940]   unless you know what's normal or not.
[03:14:17.940 --> 03:14:20.580]   And it also gives you the chance to go
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:21.900]   and intervene right now.
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:24.120]   Because right now, especially if you're older,
[03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:26.340]   I'm gonna have a higher chance of success
[03:14:26.340 --> 03:14:29.900]   than if I am four transfers down the road.
[03:14:29.900 --> 03:14:32.900]   And maybe there was one miscarriage in there too,
[03:14:32.900 --> 03:14:34.980]   we're suddenly now eight months down the road
[03:14:34.980 --> 03:14:38.340]   before I can go do another cycle and get more eggs.
[03:14:38.340 --> 03:14:39.500]   Versus if I found out
[03:14:39.500 --> 03:14:42.020]   that none of those were genetically normal,
[03:14:42.020 --> 03:14:44.460]   the average 40 year old might have zero to one
[03:14:44.460 --> 03:14:47.480]   if they have average ovarian reserve per cycle.
[03:14:47.480 --> 03:14:49.600]   So they're going to need multiple cycles.
[03:14:49.600 --> 03:14:51.040]   It's not that it's impossible,
[03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:54.120]   but it's just setting that road of expectation for them.
[03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:55.880]   But if I don't get any normal embryos,
[03:14:55.880 --> 03:14:57.820]   I can turn right around and go get more.
[03:14:57.820 --> 03:15:01.460]   So I am using what's left in that ovarian vault each month
[03:15:01.460 --> 03:15:05.000]   to try to get to that opportunity of a pregnancy for you
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:06.960]   in a much more efficient way
[03:15:06.960 --> 03:15:09.800]   by utilizing genetic testing of these embryos.
[03:15:09.800 --> 03:15:11.520]   - This is where we can put an ellipse in
[03:15:11.520 --> 03:15:14.540]   sort of like dot, dot, dot, healthy baby, right?
[03:15:14.540 --> 03:15:17.660]   And maybe in the future, if we're lucky,
[03:15:17.660 --> 03:15:20.900]   you'll come back and talk to us about healthy pregnancy
[03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:24.820]   and healthy baby onward.
[03:15:24.820 --> 03:15:28.120]   That would be a fun and important set of discussions.
[03:15:28.120 --> 03:15:31.460]   I would like to touch on the,
[03:15:31.460 --> 03:15:32.300]   I don't want to call it the issue,
[03:15:32.300 --> 03:15:33.900]   but the topic of menopause,
[03:15:33.900 --> 03:15:38.760]   which I assume is defined as the cessation of menses.
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:40.220]   But there I'm guessing,
[03:15:40.220 --> 03:15:43.180]   and I'm guessing it's a constellation of things that happen.
[03:15:43.180 --> 03:15:45.620]   And I have a very straightforward question,
[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:47.540]   which is, is there an acceleration
[03:15:47.540 --> 03:15:48.700]   of the onset of menopause?
[03:15:48.700 --> 03:15:51.620]   Are we seeing that nowadays?
[03:15:51.620 --> 03:15:53.020]   Are there good data on that?
[03:15:53.020 --> 03:15:55.940]   Should people try to delay menopause?
[03:15:55.940 --> 03:15:59.880]   What are some of the things that you talk to patients about
[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:01.420]   in terms of their considerations of ways
[03:16:01.420 --> 03:16:02.620]   to ease that transition,
[03:16:02.620 --> 03:16:04.700]   or maybe even offset that transition
[03:16:04.700 --> 03:16:08.420]   with hormone replacement therapy or other approaches?
[03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:09.580]   - These are great questions.
[03:16:09.580 --> 03:16:12.640]   And I do think this is going to be a huge interest
[03:16:12.640 --> 03:16:14.980]   in upcoming years,
[03:16:14.980 --> 03:16:17.980]   as we have learned more about the menopausal transition
[03:16:17.980 --> 03:16:20.400]   and the health risks really associated
[03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:24.160]   with being hypoestrogenic or having low estrogen.
[03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:26.460]   Menopause, if we define it as ovarian failure.
[03:16:26.460 --> 03:16:31.460]   So your ovaries now have no eggs or so few eggs
[03:16:31.460 --> 03:16:35.320]   that they are refractory to the brain sending out FSH.
[03:16:35.320 --> 03:16:38.700]   So your brain is sending out all the FSH and LH that it can.
[03:16:38.700 --> 03:16:43.060]   Your ovary is done and not making any estradiol
[03:16:43.060 --> 03:16:45.060]   or progesterone anymore.
[03:16:45.060 --> 03:16:48.720]   In this time period, what we know is one,
[03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:51.320]   are we seeing a population-based increase
[03:16:51.320 --> 03:16:52.260]   in earlier menopause?
[03:16:52.260 --> 03:16:54.040]   There's not been a study to say that.
[03:16:54.040 --> 03:16:56.340]   Observationally and clinically, I would say yes,
[03:16:56.340 --> 03:16:59.500]   because I see so many younger women
[03:16:59.500 --> 03:17:01.020]   having low ovarian reserve
[03:17:01.020 --> 03:17:03.220]   or having premature ovarian failure
[03:17:03.220 --> 03:17:05.300]   or premature ovarian insufficiency,
[03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:08.260]   which is the more politically correct way of saying it.
[03:17:08.260 --> 03:17:09.940]   But when we think about what this is,
[03:17:09.940 --> 03:17:12.020]   is there are modifiable factors, right?
[03:17:12.020 --> 03:17:14.100]   If running out of eggs is a variable,
[03:17:14.100 --> 03:17:17.040]   and we already said certain things like smoking cigarettes
[03:17:17.040 --> 03:17:20.940]   and exposure to toxins and likely chronic inflammation
[03:17:20.940 --> 03:17:24.540]   and untreated disease, we know that having diabetes,
[03:17:24.540 --> 03:17:26.700]   those things increase your risk
[03:17:26.700 --> 03:17:28.700]   of going into menopause earlier.
[03:17:28.700 --> 03:17:33.700]   So paying attention to the lifestyle that you have
[03:17:33.700 --> 03:17:36.540]   when you're not concerned about your fertility, right?
[03:17:36.540 --> 03:17:38.620]   When you're in your younger years,
[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:40.780]   and maybe you're not worried about getting pregnant yet,
[03:17:40.780 --> 03:17:42.940]   or you're not worried about menopause,
[03:17:42.940 --> 03:17:46.540]   but those choices that you're making in those time periods,
[03:17:46.540 --> 03:17:49.420]   at least for women, your eggs are gonna hold onto them.
[03:17:49.420 --> 03:17:52.620]   So they have an influence later.
[03:17:52.620 --> 03:17:56.700]   Similarly, trying to live a lower inflammatory life
[03:17:56.700 --> 03:18:00.740]   and getting sleep and avoiding toxins, of which you can,
[03:18:00.740 --> 03:18:03.220]   is some of the best that you can do
[03:18:03.220 --> 03:18:05.700]   to try to naturally prolong
[03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:08.460]   when you'll go through menopause with a huge caveat
[03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:11.220]   that everybody is truly born with a different number,
[03:18:11.220 --> 03:18:13.940]   and you do not control that, you don't.
[03:18:13.940 --> 03:18:16.540]   And so you might have been born with a lower number,
[03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:18.900]   and you can't change that trajectory.
[03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:21.860]   And you might have cancer and be exposed to chemotherapy,
[03:18:21.860 --> 03:18:25.040]   which also will deplete your ovarian reserve.
[03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:27.780]   But so do things like endometriosis,
[03:18:27.780 --> 03:18:32.180]   especially if it's not being treated in any fashion.
[03:18:32.180 --> 03:18:35.340]   So that's where we think the birth control pill
[03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:38.100]   or progestin exposure or surgery,
[03:18:38.100 --> 03:18:40.340]   ways to go and decrease the inflammation.
[03:18:40.340 --> 03:18:42.860]   It's that inflammation associated with endometriosis
[03:18:42.860 --> 03:18:45.100]   that's really causing these women
[03:18:45.100 --> 03:18:48.640]   to have low ovarian reserve and go into menopause early.
[03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:51.220]   So not only is that impacting fertility
[03:18:51.220 --> 03:18:52.200]   and how many eggs you get
[03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:54.380]   and how long you have to grow your family,
[03:18:54.380 --> 03:18:56.600]   but when you go into menopause earlier,
[03:18:56.600 --> 03:18:59.060]   you have lower life expectancy
[03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:01.500]   than people who go into menopause later.
[03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:03.260]   And that's why you even said it earlier,
[03:19:03.260 --> 03:19:06.820]   fertility is this variable kind of reflecting longevity
[03:19:06.820 --> 03:19:09.420]   and like health overall.
[03:19:09.420 --> 03:19:12.220]   So what we do know about menopause
[03:19:12.220 --> 03:19:14.020]   is that having that low estrogen,
[03:19:14.020 --> 03:19:16.740]   whether that happens at the average age of menopause at 51,
[03:19:16.740 --> 03:19:19.260]   52, or at an earlier time period,
[03:19:19.260 --> 03:19:20.900]   it's not good for the brain,
[03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:22.940]   higher risks of dementia,
[03:19:22.940 --> 03:19:25.300]   increased risks of osteoporosis,
[03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:27.420]   increased risk of heart disease and stroke,
[03:19:27.420 --> 03:19:29.140]   and essentially higher risks of death.
[03:19:29.140 --> 03:19:32.640]   And that's not even to talk about the impact on your life,
[03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:34.840]   what it can be like to have hot flashes,
[03:19:34.840 --> 03:19:36.500]   heat and cold and sensitivity,
[03:19:36.500 --> 03:19:39.940]   to have profound vulvar and vaginal atrophy
[03:19:39.940 --> 03:19:42.740]   to the point that you no longer want to have intercourse
[03:19:42.740 --> 03:19:44.480]   and the changes that it can even have
[03:19:44.480 --> 03:19:46.600]   on your gut and your immune system.
[03:19:46.600 --> 03:19:51.600]   So we, as a community of doctors, especially OBGYNs,
[03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:55.500]   really recommend hormone replacement therapy
[03:19:55.500 --> 03:19:57.860]   in women who are going through menopause.
[03:19:57.860 --> 03:20:02.100]   And the key here is to initiate it right at the beginning.
[03:20:02.100 --> 03:20:04.060]   That big Women's Health Initiative study,
[03:20:04.060 --> 03:20:06.700]   which came out forever ago and showed all this harm
[03:20:06.700 --> 03:20:08.980]   with hormone replacement therapy,
[03:20:08.980 --> 03:20:11.300]   the big issue there was that these people
[03:20:11.300 --> 03:20:15.300]   were hypoestrogenic for 10 plus years in one group,
[03:20:15.300 --> 03:20:17.560]   and then started back on the hormones.
[03:20:17.560 --> 03:20:19.180]   And in that circumstance,
[03:20:19.180 --> 03:20:22.140]   they'd already been put into this higher risk category
[03:20:22.140 --> 03:20:25.100]   and their body had adjusted to not having the hormones.
[03:20:25.100 --> 03:20:28.920]   And when re-exposed, they had more adverse events.
[03:20:28.920 --> 03:20:33.180]   But if you are starting on estrogen replacement,
[03:20:33.180 --> 03:20:35.260]   and it can be various, but honestly,
[03:20:35.260 --> 03:20:37.920]   the estrogen that we try to replace in this time period
[03:20:37.920 --> 03:20:39.700]   much more mimics estradiol.
[03:20:39.700 --> 03:20:41.280]   We have estradiol pills.
[03:20:41.280 --> 03:20:44.340]   You can have vaginal inserts, you can have patches.
[03:20:44.340 --> 03:20:47.020]   So it depends on what's gonna work for your life,
[03:20:47.020 --> 03:20:51.640]   but it is not the birth control pill most oftenly.
[03:20:51.640 --> 03:20:53.560]   In some people, it might be that's what they choose,
[03:20:53.560 --> 03:20:55.800]   but we really are trying to pick an estrogen
[03:20:55.800 --> 03:20:59.620]   that is estradiol, more mimics that natural structure.
[03:20:59.620 --> 03:21:01.740]   And you can't have unopposed estrogen
[03:21:01.740 --> 03:21:05.020]   without reaching the risk of endometrial cancer.
[03:21:05.020 --> 03:21:07.420]   And so that's why we need to have some progestin.
[03:21:07.420 --> 03:21:09.740]   So some people will choose a daily progestin,
[03:21:09.740 --> 03:21:13.180]   some will choose a cyclic progestin and still have periods.
[03:21:13.180 --> 03:21:15.300]   Some will put in an IUD at this time period
[03:21:15.300 --> 03:21:17.860]   and then take their daily estrogen.
[03:21:17.860 --> 03:21:19.720]   There's a lot of different options.
[03:21:19.720 --> 03:21:22.800]   We're trying to find the lowest dose of hormones
[03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:25.420]   that relieves your symptoms to provide you relief
[03:21:25.420 --> 03:21:26.780]   from some of these lifestyle issues,
[03:21:26.780 --> 03:21:30.560]   but also helps you not just live longer, right?
[03:21:30.560 --> 03:21:32.180]   We're not just trying to live longer.
[03:21:32.180 --> 03:21:33.860]   We want to be healthy longer.
[03:21:33.860 --> 03:21:36.180]   We want to have a better quality of life.
[03:21:36.180 --> 03:21:39.740]   And certainly women's health has for long stopped
[03:21:39.740 --> 03:21:41.220]   at this menopausal period.
[03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:43.500]   And then it's been, you're on your own, kid.
[03:21:43.500 --> 03:21:45.040]   And this is when we're really starting to see
[03:21:45.040 --> 03:21:47.100]   that intervening at that place,
[03:21:47.100 --> 03:21:51.260]   especially for women who go into ovarian failure early.
[03:21:51.260 --> 03:21:53.260]   So those people who have low ovarian reserve,
[03:21:53.260 --> 03:21:55.260]   who I diagnose, I tell all of them,
[03:21:55.260 --> 03:21:58.380]   hey, if you don't freeze your eggs or I never see you again,
[03:21:58.380 --> 03:22:00.320]   you're going to go through menopause early.
[03:22:00.320 --> 03:22:02.660]   And when you do, I want you to go see somebody.
[03:22:02.660 --> 03:22:04.440]   I don't want you to just ignore it
[03:22:04.440 --> 03:22:06.700]   and suffer with these symptoms,
[03:22:06.700 --> 03:22:08.860]   which is something that does commonly happen.
[03:22:08.860 --> 03:22:11.980]   So just making sure that women are empowered to know
[03:22:11.980 --> 03:22:14.260]   that these symptoms are what happens,
[03:22:14.260 --> 03:22:15.860]   it's what happens naturally,
[03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:18.220]   but by giving their bodies more estrogen
[03:22:18.220 --> 03:22:19.700]   and not crazy high doses,
[03:22:19.700 --> 03:22:22.380]   but just these physiologic levels can really improve
[03:22:22.380 --> 03:22:25.220]   both the quality and the longevity of their life.
[03:22:25.220 --> 03:22:28.180]   - Is it just the presence of the symptoms
[03:22:28.180 --> 03:22:32.580]   that signals the onset of menopause,
[03:22:32.580 --> 03:22:35.100]   or is there, are there additional cues?
[03:22:35.100 --> 03:22:35.920]   Like for instance,
[03:22:35.920 --> 03:22:37.900]   if their cycle is getting shorter or longer.
[03:22:37.900 --> 03:22:39.780]   - You certainly will have cycle changes.
[03:22:39.780 --> 03:22:42.660]   And we consider that the perimenopausal period,
[03:22:42.660 --> 03:22:44.460]   where you're starting to really start seeing
[03:22:44.460 --> 03:22:46.620]   a spacing out of your period.
[03:22:46.620 --> 03:22:48.260]   So they're no longer coming
[03:22:48.260 --> 03:22:50.500]   at that perfect ovulatory pattern.
[03:22:50.500 --> 03:22:52.180]   When you get into the low ovarian reserve,
[03:22:52.180 --> 03:22:53.740]   but you're still ovulating regularly,
[03:22:53.740 --> 03:22:56.260]   literally they first shorten, as we said earlier,
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:22:57.660]   but then when they start lengthening
[03:22:57.660 --> 03:22:59.140]   or you start skipping months,
[03:22:59.140 --> 03:23:00.580]   that's a real big clue
[03:23:00.580 --> 03:23:04.140]   that things are not going in the right direction.
[03:23:04.140 --> 03:23:07.300]   And if you find out you have very, very low ovarian reserve,
[03:23:07.300 --> 03:23:09.740]   or you're approaching that perimenopause period,
[03:23:09.740 --> 03:23:11.540]   you're gonna start to have more prolonged periods
[03:23:11.540 --> 03:23:16.540]   of low estrogen and you'll feel mentally cloudy, fatigued,
[03:23:16.540 --> 03:23:20.740]   more headaches, more hot flashes, lack of libido,
[03:23:20.740 --> 03:23:22.620]   those vulvar vaginal symptoms,
[03:23:22.620 --> 03:23:25.500]   overall more likelihood to have depressed mood.
[03:23:25.500 --> 03:23:27.660]   And that's a lot.
[03:23:27.660 --> 03:23:28.500]   - That's a lot.
[03:23:28.500 --> 03:23:31.920]   Well, Natalie, Dr. Crawford,
[03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:35.540]   I want to extend a huge thank you on behalf of myself.
[03:23:35.540 --> 03:23:39.060]   I've learned so much from you today about fertility,
[03:23:39.060 --> 03:23:40.420]   about hormone health for women.
[03:23:40.420 --> 03:23:42.220]   And you've also touched on a number of important issues
[03:23:42.220 --> 03:23:44.660]   about hormone health and fertility for men along the way.
[03:23:44.660 --> 03:23:48.980]   So it's truly been a masterclass in fertility and hormones
[03:23:48.980 --> 03:23:50.860]   and really touched on topics
[03:23:50.860 --> 03:23:53.240]   that are so essential to everybody,
[03:23:53.240 --> 03:23:54.900]   even if people aren't seeking to conceive
[03:23:54.900 --> 03:23:56.880]   or maybe think they don't want to.
[03:23:56.880 --> 03:23:59.340]   I mean, there's so many considerations
[03:23:59.340 --> 03:24:01.900]   that really extend back to one's teens.
[03:24:01.900 --> 03:24:03.340]   And if one is beyond their teens,
[03:24:03.340 --> 03:24:05.340]   like whatever age people are, essentially,
[03:24:05.340 --> 03:24:06.660]   they need to think about these issues
[03:24:06.660 --> 03:24:08.060]   and make important decisions.
[03:24:08.060 --> 03:24:10.240]   And you've really also clarified a lot of the,
[03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:12.020]   what I think are quite destructive myths
[03:24:12.020 --> 03:24:14.780]   that are prominent out there about,
[03:24:14.780 --> 03:24:15.900]   for instance, egg harvest
[03:24:15.900 --> 03:24:18.380]   and what that does to one's fertility.
[03:24:18.380 --> 03:24:21.640]   So first of all, thank you for joining us today.
[03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:22.660]   I know you're extremely busy.
[03:24:22.660 --> 03:24:25.440]   You run a clinic, you manage a family as well,
[03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:27.060]   co-manage a family, I believe.
[03:24:27.060 --> 03:24:30.020]   But this is the sort of knowledge
[03:24:30.020 --> 03:24:33.400]   that is so challenging to find in one place.
[03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:36.240]   And yet you also have a number of really spectacular avenues
[03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:40.480]   that you deliver information, Instagram, podcasts, books,
[03:24:40.480 --> 03:24:41.320]   and things of that sort.
[03:24:41.320 --> 03:24:43.880]   We will refer everyone to those links.
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:46.940]   I've learned so much from you over the years, really,
[03:24:46.940 --> 03:24:47.980]   in following your content.
[03:24:47.980 --> 03:24:50.540]   And today you've just like far exceeded
[03:24:50.540 --> 03:24:52.700]   all already high expectations.
[03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:55.380]   So thank you ever so much.
[03:24:55.380 --> 03:24:56.200]   - Thank you for having me
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:24:58.820]   and just thank you for giving a space
[03:24:58.820 --> 03:25:00.380]   to talk about women's health and fertility
[03:25:00.380 --> 03:25:01.380]   and reproductive medicine.
[03:25:01.380 --> 03:25:05.220]   It means a lot to me and it means a lot to the people
[03:25:05.220 --> 03:25:07.260]   who really are trying to do their best every day.
[03:25:07.260 --> 03:25:08.620]   So we appreciate it.
[03:25:08.620 --> 03:25:09.540]   - We appreciate you.
[03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:11.300]   And with some luck, we'll commit you to come back
[03:25:11.300 --> 03:25:13.020]   and talk to us about pregnancy
[03:25:13.020 --> 03:25:14.820]   and a bit more on some of the topics
[03:25:14.820 --> 03:25:16.740]   that we moved through quickly.
[03:25:16.740 --> 03:25:17.580]   Thank you.
[03:25:17.580 --> 03:25:18.500]   - Thank you.
[03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:20.220]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:25:20.220 --> 03:25:22.200]   about female hormones and fertility
[03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:23.660]   with Dr. Natalie Crawford.
[03:25:23.660 --> 03:25:25.740]   You can find links to her clinical practice
[03:25:25.740 --> 03:25:27.580]   as well as to her social media handles
[03:25:27.580 --> 03:25:29.000]   in the show note captions.

[03:26:03.760 --> 03:26:04.880]   Not during today's episode,
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:07.660]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:26:07.660 --> 03:26:08.900]   we discuss supplements.
[03:26:08.900 --> 03:26:11.080]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:13.400]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:26:13.400 --> 03:26:15.200]   for things like enhancing sleep,
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:17.480]   hormone support, and improving focus.
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:19.400]   If you'd like to learn more about the supplements discussed
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:20.880]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:23.400]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[03:26:23.400 --> 03:26:26.600]   so livemomentus.com/huberman.
[03:26:26.600 --> 03:26:28.480]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:26:28.480 --> 03:26:31.200]   it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:26:31.200 --> 03:26:34.300]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[03:26:34.300 --> 03:26:35.800]   Threads, Facebook, LinkedIn.
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:37.040]   And on all those places,
[03:26:37.040 --> 03:26:38.980]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:26:38.980 --> 03:26:40.440]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:41.880]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:26:41.880 --> 03:26:43.760]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:26:43.760 --> 03:26:44.960]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:48.400]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:49.560]   If you haven't already subscribed
[03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:51.800]   to our monthly neural network newsletter,
[03:26:51.800 --> 03:26:52.920]   the neural network newsletter
[03:26:52.920 --> 03:26:55.200]   is a completely zero cost newsletter
[03:26:55.200 --> 03:26:56.800]   that gives you podcast summaries,
[03:26:56.800 --> 03:26:59.440]   as well as toolkits in the form of brief PDFs.
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:02.720]   We've had toolkits related to optimizing sleep,
[03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:05.640]   to regulating dopamine, deliberate cold exposure,
[03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:07.840]   fitness, mental health, learning,
[03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:09.920]   and neuroplasticity, and much more.
[03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:11.740]   Again, it's completely zero cost to sign up.
[03:27:11.740 --> 03:27:13.440]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,

[03:27:15.800 --> 03:27:17.360]   and supply your email.
[03:27:17.360 --> 03:27:18.880]   I should emphasize that we do not share
[03:27:18.880 --> 03:27:20.700]   your email with anybody.
[03:27:20.700 --> 03:27:22.100]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:27:22.100 --> 03:27:24.760]   for today's discussion with Dr. Natalie Crawford.
[03:27:24.760 --> 03:27:26.960]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:27:26.960 --> 03:27:28.720]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:27:28.720 --> 03:27:31.300]   (upbeat music)
[03:27:31.300 --> 03:27:33.880]   (upbeat music)
