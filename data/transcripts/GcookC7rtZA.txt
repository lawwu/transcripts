[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Now we've been considering at great length the doctrine of the second coming of our Lord.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.600]   And our conclusion was, you will recall, that this will happen at the end of the age, that
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.720]   there is only one coming of the Lord, which is at the last day.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.520]   And that that coming will be associated with certain things.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.760]   And one of them, of course, is the resurrection of the dead.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.400]   Now we've had to say, in dealing with the doctrine of our Lord's second coming, that
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   as we understand the teaching of the scripture, there is only one resurrection.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.000]   We do not accept that teaching which says that there are two, or at least two, perhaps
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.720]   even three, with an interval of a thousand years and more between the two main resurrections.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.400]   I've already given you evidence to show that our Lord himself taught that the good and
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:08.600]   the bad would rise together so that we teach one general resurrection of the dead.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.240]   As the creed puts it, we believe in the resurrection of the dead, that general resurrection, and
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.640]   that it will take place at the last day.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.160]   It is something that will happen when our Lord returns in the way that we have seen
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.440]   visibly, and in bodily form, and in glory, and surrounded by holy angels in the clouds
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.520]   of heaven, and so on.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.840]   Now then, as we have approached all other doctrines, we must approach this doctrine
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.760]   in the same way.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:52.720]   First of all, the scriptural evidence for this doctrine of the resurrection.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.000]   First of all, we must go to the Old Testament.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.680]   We do that because the Old Testament is a part of our scripture.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.200]   But we do so also particularly because there have been those who have tried to teach that
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.960]   there is nothing at all in the Old Testament about the resurrection.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.880]   That of course is just not true.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.640]   If they had said that there is much less, or that there isn't very much in the Old
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.480]   Testament about the resurrection, well then it would have been true.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.280]   Now there are many Christians who are rather stumbled by just that fact.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.400]   They wonder why there is this difference in the teaching of the Old Testament and the
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.320]   New Testament with regard to this subject.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.240]   There is, I say, a very striking difference, but to me it doesn't constitute a problem
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.920]   at all for this reason.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.440]   That the whole doctrine of salvation is not as clear in the Old Testament as it is in
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.920]   the New, it is there of course.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.000]   And if we go back to it with New Testament eyes and with a New Testament understanding,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.680]   we can find it in all sorts of places.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.520]   But if we can transpose our minds, as it were, back to the Old Testament times, well then
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.600]   we can see very clearly how much that is plain and obvious to us could not possibly have
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.200]   been plain and obvious at that time.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.320]   Let me give you one illustration.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.720]   We have often noticed together the curious inability of the disciples even to grasp our
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.520]   Lord's teaching about his death and his resurrection.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.000]   Every time he spoke about his death to them, they were in trouble.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.640]   They couldn't understand it.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.240]   They couldn't receive it somehow.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.520]   And they seem to have ignored entirely everything that he had said about the resurrection, because
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.440]   when he tells them that he is going to be crucified, he goes on always to say that he
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.080]   shall rise the third day, but they don't seem to grasp it.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.120]   That is why they were all so crestfallen and so miserable when they saw him being crucified
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.000]   and after his body had been buried in the grave.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.240]   They couldn't receive it.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.880]   Well very well, if that was true even of the disciples who had been with him for three
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   years in person, how much less were the saints of the Old Testament able to receive it.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.240]   So that I would not expect it there in a very plain and emphatic manner.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.880]   And it isn't.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.240]   As the New Testament itself puts it, as the Apostle Paul puts it in the second epistle
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.080]   to Timothy, first chapter, tenth verse, it is the Lord Jesus Christ himself by his own
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.640]   resurrection who has abolished death, put it out of gear as it were, and has brought
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.100]   life and immortality to light through his gospel.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.120]   The fact was there, the fact was known, but it is he who has brought it to light.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.600]   Therefore you would expect it to be much clearer in the New Testament than it is in the Old,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.200]   and such proves to be the case.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.720]   But there is, of course, evidence of a clear belief in it in the Old Testament itself.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.440]   Let me just give you some of the well-known and the most obvious bits of evidence.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.120]   Take for instance the book of Job, the famous statement in chapter 19, which is familiar
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   to most of us.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.440]   Let me read verses 25, 26, and 27.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.960]   "For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   the earth.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.840]   And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I shall see God, whom
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.520]   I shall see for myself; and mine eyes shall behold, and not another, though my veins be
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.920]   consumed within me."
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.320]   That is Job 19, verses 25 to 27.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.960]   And then of course there are two psalms, psalms 16 and 17, which have clear evidence of this,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.440]   and they were quoted for that reason by Peter and by Paul in their preaching in the early
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   days of the Christian church.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   Take the ninth verse of the sixteenth psalm.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:17.320]   "Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also shall rest in hope."
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.600]   Then verse 10, "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.400]   holy one to see corruption."
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.760]   Quoted, obviously, by Peter on the day of Pentecost, because it is such a wonderful
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.800]   prophecy of the resurrection of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.240]   But the same is true, you see, in verse 9 also, where the psalmist is speaking perhaps
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.320]   more directly of himself as a person, and in not such a messianic manner as he is in
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.920]   verse 10.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.680]   Then take the seventeenth psalm, verse 15.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   "As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   likeness."
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.280]   Now surely, that is very striking and very wonderful.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.760]   And then let me read to you the well-known words out of the twelfth chapter, the last
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.400]   chapter of the book of the prophet Daniel, reading verses 1 to 3.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.720]   "And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.220]   of thy people.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.680]   And there shall be a time of trouble such as never was, since there was a nation even
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.600]   to that same time.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.800]   And at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.840]   book.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.400]   life and some to shame and everlasting contempt.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.000]   And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.160]   to righteousness as the stars forever and ever."
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   Now there is further evidence.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.960]   There is evidence in the book of the prophet Hosea, but let us content ourselves with that
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.680]   that we may pass on.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.780]   There is more than sufficient evidence to prove that this idea that the whole notion
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.320]   of resurrection was unknown in the Old Testament is quite wrong.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   It is there.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.080]   Indeed, you get it in a sense in the words that we read about Abraham in the eleventh
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.960]   chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, where we are told that when he was on the point
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.320]   of offering Isaac, he had faith to believe that God could even raise him from the dead.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.080]   And there is much other evidence.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.560]   But let us come to the New Testament.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.280]   Because as I say, it is here we have the greatest amount of evidence, quite inevitably.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.200]   And the evidence starts, of course, in the teaching of our Lord himself in the gospel.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.920]   Now there is a most important statement in the twenty-second chapter of Matthew's gospel,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:03.440]   and I am going to read to you a section which begins at verse twenty-three.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   The twenty-second chapter of Matthew, in verse twenty-three we read, "The same day came
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.280]   to him the Sadducees, which say, 'There is no resurrection.'
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.020]   And they asked him, saying, 'Master, Moses said, 'If a man die having no children, his
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.700]   brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.'"
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:28.200]   And then you remember their famous case of the seven brothers who married the same woman.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.160]   Now they thought this really was going to be wonderful, because they all died and then
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.480]   the next married the woman, and then the question comes out at the end, "Therefore, in the
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.120]   resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven?
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   For they all had her."
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:54.200]   Jesus answered and said unto them, "Ye doer, not knowing the Scriptures."
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.280]   And remember, Scriptures there mean Old Testament.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.640]   So you see, our Lord evidently knew the evidence about resurrection in the Old Testament Scriptures.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.480]   You doer, not knowing the Scriptures, which you think you know so much about and of which
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.280]   you claim to be authorities, you doer, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:22.200]   "For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.140]   angels of God in heaven.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.600]   But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.960]   you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.240]   God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.080]   In other words, our Lord's argument is that when God proclaims himself to be the God of
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, he is proclaiming that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.880]   are to go on living in a resurrected form.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.320]   There is his proof of the resurrection.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.800]   Now this is the most important statement, and I shall have to return to it again for
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   another reason.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.560]   I am picking out certain places at random.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:15.320]   Take again a statement in the fourteenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, verses
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   13 and 14.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.240]   A man again puts a question.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.840]   Our Lord in reply says, "When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.960]   nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbors, lest they also bid thee
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.880]   again and a recompense be made thee.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:44.720]   But when thou makest a feast, call the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.120]   and thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee, for thou shalt be recompensed
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.600]   at the resurrection of the just."
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.880]   Luke 4, verse 14 in particular.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.640]   Well then there are a number of statements in the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.760]   As I have referred to them, the last two, I will read them again, but I will give you
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.120]   a reminder of them.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.080]   Chapter 5, verses 28 and 29.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:22.640]   Chapter 6, verses 39, 40, 44, and 54, where our Lord keeps on saying, "I shall raise
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.760]   it at the last day," or "I will raise him at the last day."
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.600]   There is this tremendous evidence then in the fifth and sixth chapters of the Gospel
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.760]   according to St. John in our Lord's teaching.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:45.320]   There it is in great abundance, and the parallel passages in the other Gospels.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.520]   Then of course you come to the mighty, the tremendous evidence in all the Gospels about
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.600]   the fact of our Lord's own resurrection.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.440]   Staggering in its importance, but there it is in them.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.640]   And then you go on to the book of the Acts of the Apostles where you have got now the
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.200]   preaching and the teaching of the Christian Church.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.440]   After the resurrection and after the day of Pentecost when they have been sent out.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.360]   And you will find that they all preached Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.800]   But not only that, they did not stop at that.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:25.600]   Paul's preaching says that we have hope toward God, which they themselves, the Jews,
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.920]   That was the kind of thing that they all preached, Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.320]   And not only the resurrection of the Lord Jesus himself, but our resurrection.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.240]   As Paul puts it, you remember, graphically, in his famous sermon at Athens, he says, "God
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:57.120]   hath appointed a day wherein he shall judge the whole world in righteousness by that man
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.520]   whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.880]   him from the dead."
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880]   And so on.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.640]   The evidence is really overwhelming.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:17.040]   And then, of course, you come on to that great and mighty chapter, a portion of which we
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.080]   have read at the beginning, 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:28.720]   Surely there is no greater piece of literature in the world than that.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:35.120]   For thought, for sublimity of expression, for argument, for reason, for the currency
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   of the case presented, and for the profoundly moving character of the whole statement.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.840]   1 Corinthians 15.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.460]   I do not know what you feel, but for myself, it would have been more than sufficient tonight
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.640]   if we had simply met together to read that section of Scripture.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:59.080]   If that does not warm your heart and make you feel like rising to your feet to praise
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   God and to worship him, well, then, I confess, I do not understand you.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:12.240]   Then we go on to the Epistle to the Philippians, the third chapter, in the twenty-first verse.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:20.640]   We look from the Saviour from heaven, who shall change this our vile body, that he may
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.920]   fashion it like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.960]   subdue even all things unto himself.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.760]   And then, of course, the statement which we considered weeks ago in the first epistle
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.080]   to the Thessalonians, in the fourth chapter.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:45.280]   The apostle is concerned that these Thessalonians were mourning and grieving as those who are
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.760]   without hope, so he writes to comfort them and to cheer them, and with his great assurance
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.960]   about the resurrection.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.160]   Both of those who are already dead and those who remain were going to be changed.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.640]   Some of them were beginning to think that the dead had finished, as it were, they would
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.240]   not share in the glories of that great reign of Christ that was to come.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.540]   Paul says, "It's all right, they will be.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.720]   We shan't be before them, we shan't prevent them.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.640]   They will rise first, and we shall be changed," and so on.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:22.880]   Well, now, there, very inadequately and hurriedly, is some of the evidence that is to be found
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.760]   in the Scripture, both in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:34.640]   But now let me try and come to deal with certain points about which people sometimes find themselves
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.160]   in difficulties.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.920]   What is the nature of the resurrection?
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.680]   And when I talk about the biblical doctrine of the resurrection, what do I mean?
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.440]   Well, now, the answer is this.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.000]   It refers to the literal resurrection of the body.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.800]   Now, that isn't always made as plain and as clear as it should be.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:02.160]   The biblical doctrine of the resurrection is the doctrine of the resurrection of the
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.800]   body, our bodies.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.600]   It isn't something spiritual only.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   Well, of course, there are many people today who say it is nothing spiritual, and what
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.000]   they mean by resurrection is that somehow or another you go on living after you die.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.680]   There are many who hold that view, of course, about our Lord Himself.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.760]   There are many people who make a great deal of Easter Sunday and have it as a special
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.680]   day in their calendar, and they are preaching on the resurrection.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.080]   But what they say is that Jesus just gave proof that He was still there, that He was
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.120]   still alive.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   They don't believe in what they call the nonsense and the rubbish of the empty tomb.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.760]   They deny that completely.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.080]   And still they think they are believing the doctrine of the resurrection, but they are
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.840]   not, they are denying it.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:58.880]   It is a doctrine, I want to show you, which asserts the literal raising of the body, not
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:06.080]   something spiritual only, not a man's spirit continuing, but the body as well included.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.280]   And in Luke 24, verse 39, you read this.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:19.480]   Our Lord could see the scepticism in the very faces of the disciples themselves, the apostles.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.120]   They were frightened, we were told.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.360]   They thought they were seeing a ghost, a spirit.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.240]   So our Lord said to them, "Look at me.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.720]   Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:43.400]   Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as he see may have."
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.640]   He says, "I am not a phantom, I am not a spirit.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.680]   Look at me, look at my hands, look at my feet.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.320]   Can't you see that it is I myself?"
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.000]   That is the thing, I myself.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.280]   "Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as he see may have."
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:05.480]   That is enough in and of itself to prove that the resurrection is the resurrection of the
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.360]   body, and not merely something spiritual.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.800]   And of course, there is the same argument, rarely, in the twentieth chapter of the Gospel
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:20.680]   according to St. John, in the case of the poor, doubting Thomas, who when he came back,
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.080]   you remember, was told that the Lord had risen and had appeared.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.400]   He said he wouldn't believe it.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.240]   And he said that he wouldn't believe it, except, "I see in his hands the print of
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.360]   the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   side.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.040]   I will not believe," says Thomas.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.520]   Then our Lord appeared and said to Thomas, "Reach out of thy finger, and behold my
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.280]   hands.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.720]   And reach out of thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing."
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.200]   His body, the same body had arisen.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:06.320]   It has got the mark and the imprint of the nail still, and the hole in the side.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.000]   It was there in this resurrected body.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.600]   It is a resurrection of the body, my friends.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.520]   And then take the great argument of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.040]   Of course, the whole point of that argument is about the body.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.360]   It is not a discussion of some spiritual rising.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.420]   The whole case, the whole wonderful argument that the apostle works out is obviously about
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.840]   our physical bodies.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.760]   Indeed, there is one statement that is enough in and of itself, where he says that, "As
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.880]   in Adam, we all die."
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.680]   And there, it is mainly the physical death he is referring to.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.000]   Even so, in Christ shall all be made alive.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.080]   And evidently, he is considering the question of the body.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.080]   And of course, if you go on to the second epistle to Timothy in the second chapter,
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.740]   you will find that the apostle there deals with precisely the same matter.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:08.460]   There were some who were saying that the resurrection was passed already.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.160]   They were trying to say it was something spiritual.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.600]   And Paul gives his reply to it.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.640]   Read it there, to Timothy 2, about verse 18.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:27.860]   But in a very interesting way, there is a distinction drawn by our Lord himself between
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:34.040]   what you may call a spiritual resurrection, what I called last Friday the first resurrection
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:40.600]   in chapter 20 of the book of Revelations, and this literal bodily resurrection which
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.400]   we are considering tonight.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:49.440]   In the fifth chapter of John's Gospel, in verse 25, I read this, "Verily, verily, I
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.720]   say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.880]   the Son of God, and they that hear shall live."
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.080]   That is undoubtedly spiritual.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:11.360]   Verse 25, but go on to verse 28, and there you get this, "Marvel not at this, for the
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.840]   hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.880]   come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, they that have done
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.920]   evil unto the resurrection of damnation."
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.680]   That refers to the body.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.400]   Verse 25, spiritual.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.920]   This first resurrection, regeneration, the spiritually dead are raised, but then in verse
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:41.760]   28, literal bodily physical resurrection.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.000]   And of course, I've already quoted to you Philippians 3.21, "This our vile body shall
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   be changed."
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.040]   He's talking about the body, and it's the same in 1 Thessalonians 4, where he talks
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.640]   about our being changed.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.680]   Now then, there is the evidence for it, but let me ask a question at this point.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.920]   Why am I insisting upon this?
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:12.400]   And why must we insist upon the resurrection of the body?
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:19.120]   And why must we say that it's terrible heresy and a denial of truth to deny the resurrection
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   of the body?
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.320]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:31.520]   Salvation is not complete without the resurrection of the body.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.680]   And that is why the apostle wrote that 15th chapter of 1 Corinthians.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.400]   There were these people going round, you see, who said there's no resurrection of the body,
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.680]   this is something spiritual.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.600]   And as I say, he does it again in 2 Timothy 2.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.760]   The apostle says, you see, "If that is so, our preaching is vain.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.680]   You are yet in your sins, there's no salvation."
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.600]   He says to those Corinthians, "If you don't stand in this faith which I preached to you
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.960]   when I first came to you, well, you've got nothing at all, and you're not saved, and
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.800]   you're not Christians.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.680]   And it includes the resurrection of the body."
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   Why?
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.200]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:20.000]   There were heresies in the world then, as there are still, which taught that sin is
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.840]   rarely something that only applies to the body.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:32.440]   That sin is something physical, and that salvation therefore means escaping out of the body.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.680]   You know, that's the teaching of Hinduism.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.480]   That's the teaching of Buddhism.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.200]   The great thing is to escape out of the body, to get rid of the flesh.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.160]   The moment you get out of the body, you've left sin behind, because sin, they say, is
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.720]   something in the flesh only.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.600]   And their thought of salvation is liberation out of the body.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:00.000]   It's the exact opposite of Christian salvation, which teaches this.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.080]   Not escape out of the body, but the redemption even of the body.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.840]   When man sinned, as we saw two and a half years ago, or whenever it was we began this
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:18.920]   series, we saw clearly that the effect of sin upon men was that it did something to
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:27.400]   his spirit, his soul, and his body.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.080]   The whole of man suffered.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.640]   When men fell, the whole of men fell.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.320]   He fell in every part of him, his body included.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.000]   And therefore, before salvation can be completed, it must include the body also.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.160]   Salvation is not only for the soul and spirit, it must include the body, otherwise it's
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160]   incomplete.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.160]   It hasn't done the works of the devil.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.280]   Christ, we are told by John in his first epistle, came that he might destroy the works of the
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.360]   devil, and this is one of them.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.200]   So he's got to redeem the body, and he's going to do so.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.440]   Here's my evidence for that.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.640]   The Apostle Paul brings it out in a particularly clear manner in his epistle to the Romans
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.520]   in chapter 8.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:19.920]   Now when we were doing the doctrine of sanctification a year ago, we dealt with this, and we've
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.080]   also referred to it since then.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.680]   But let me again read you these verses, they're so important.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.160]   Take the eleventh verse of the eighth chapter of Romans.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:36.320]   "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:45.400]   raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.200]   dwelleth in you."
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.000]   That's the argument.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.600]   If the Holy Spirit is in you, it's a guarantee of the fact that your very body is going to
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.200]   be quickened and raised up and glorified.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.440]   But again he says it, of course, in verse 23.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.920]   Starting in verse 22 he says, "We know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.480]   in pain together until now.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.960]   And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:23.360]   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to wit, the redemption of
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.720]   our body."
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.000]   The body is going to be redeemed, never forget that.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.400]   It's a part of our salvation.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.840]   Then of course, as I've been showing you, the whole of that first Corinthians chapter
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.440]   15 is a mighty argument to the same effect.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.080]   But again you know in the second epistle to the Corinthians in the fifth chapter, the
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   apostle brings it in.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.100]   And how we tend to miss these glorious statements in the Scripture.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:58.520]   The apostle says, "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.320]   have a building of God, a house not made with hens, eternal in the heavens.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.680]   For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   heaven.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.480]   If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened."
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:26.960]   Now listen, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.200]   up of life.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.780]   There it is once more.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.000]   We know that while we are absent from the body, we are present with the Lord and so
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   on.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.140]   The whole of that chapter really deals with the same thing.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:29:06.820]   But again, do not forget Philippians 3 verse 21.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.900]   Well, now that brings me to another question that often perplexes people.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:17.420]   What is the nature of this resurrection body?
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.660]   People are in trouble, of course, for this reason.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.340]   They say, "Well, that old doctrine, of course, it's in the Scriptures and people
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.460]   believed it for years because when people died they were buried.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:35.120]   They knew nothing about bombs which could blow a body to pieces, to atoms.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.000]   If they had known about things like that, they would not have believed in the resurrection
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   of the body."
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.060]   Well, of course, it is a very stupid argument that because they knew that bodies buried
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:49.860]   in graves decayed, that worms came and disintegrated them and devoured them, they knew that there
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.360]   was decomposition and putrefaction.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.360]   They knew all that.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.720]   They knew it all.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.920]   We know nothing that they did not know.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:03.220]   Men got drowned in those days, even as they do now, and so on.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.940]   Well then, that leads to the question, "What is the nature of this resurrection body that
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.700]   you're speaking of, if you say that the body is to be resurrected?"
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.940]   Well, there are certain things we can say about it.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:23.300]   One is that the Scripture teaches very clearly that our identity is going to be preserved.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.880]   My body will always be recognizable as my body.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.380]   As our Lord said to those disciples in the upper room, "Can't you see that it is I
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.760]   myself?
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.780]   And I will be myself, and you will be yourself, forever and forever."
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.260]   The identity of the body is going to be preserved.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.820]   And the other thing that is quite obvious in the teaching is that there is an organic
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.500]   connection between the body that is buried and the body that is raised.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.300]   There is an organic connection.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:01.340]   Paul's argument about placing the seed in the ground and what comes up out of it is
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.220]   an absolute proof of that.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   There is an organic connection between the seed of grain that is sown and that which
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.780]   comes up.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:15.700]   "But wait a minute, how is this possible?" says someone.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:22.800]   "What about the case of a man who has been cremated and his ashes are scattered, carried
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.380]   away by the wind?"
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.340]   People try to ridicule the doctrine of the resurrection by saying, "Are you asking
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.020]   us to believe that these particles are all going to be gathered together from somewhere?
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.260]   But haven't some of them already passed into other forms of life and have been eaten,
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.700]   perhaps, by animals?" and so on.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:45.580]   Well, the doctrine of the resurrection does not teach that the same particles are going
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.380]   to be raised.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:54.320]   And for this reason, it is a scientific fact that the actual particles of our body are
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.060]   always changing.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.500]   There are some people who teach that our bodies are absolutely changed every seven
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.900]   years.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.900]   We do know that there is a wastage and a breakdown.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.980]   The cells of the body are constantly being broken down and disappearing and disintegrating.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:15.260]   I haven't got the same particles in my flesh as I had twenty years ago.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.540]   That's an obvious fact.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.480]   And yet, you see, I have the same body.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.340]   It isn't composed of the same particles as such, but it's the same body.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:30.780]   Not only that, take a little child, a baby, and then think of that same person as an oxygenarian.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.460]   She wouldn't recognize, but it's the same body.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.700]   The particles are obviously not the same, and they're not arranged in the same way.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:46.940]   But that child's body is the same body as it will have when he'll be an oxygenarian.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.700]   Rather, I think that enables us to see what is meant by this.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:59.220]   The body must not be thought of in terms of particles, flesh and blood, as Paul puts it.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.280]   Don't think in that materialistic sense.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.380]   That isn't what makes the body the body.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.780]   Well, what is the body?
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:13.340]   Well, the body, if you like, in a sense, is the particular order of the particles, or
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.940]   the particular organization of the particles, that makes my body my body, and your body
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.820]   your body.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.100]   The body is a very remarkable thing.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.220]   If you analyzed it down to its ultimate component parts and elements, it's the same in every
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.260]   one of us.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.500]   And flesh and blood is the same.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.860]   And yet, you see, the bodies are not the same.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.460]   And there are all these odd things in the bodies.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.660]   The different size of the two eyes, the distance from the corner of the eye to the corner of
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.580]   the lip, even on the two sides of the same man's face, and all these things.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.740]   These are the things that make the body the body.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.900]   And they're not dependent upon the particular particles, or the continuation of the same
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.020]   particles.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.460]   So you see, when the Scripture asserts the resurrection of the body, it's asserting
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.460]   that.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.740]   That's the vital thing.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:14.700]   The body is not static, it's constantly changing in its elements, in its constitution.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:22.300]   But the body remains a constant, and that's the thing that's going on.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.780]   With regard to the actual constitution, we don't know, and the Scripture doesn't tell
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.780]   us.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.140]   But surely the argument of Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 is to the effect that there's going to
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:36.220]   be a change in the constitution, as you get it in the grain of wheat that is buried and
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.340]   disintegrates and leads to life.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:47.260]   But it's essentially the continuation of the same thing in an organic connection.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:54.940]   So that we explain what is so often to people a kind of pseudo-scientific problem in that
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.180]   particular way.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:01.660]   But let me give you further evidence, it'll help to make this point clear.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:09.340]   What will be the character of the body which we shall have after we have been raised?
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.260]   Now here I must just say this.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:17.500]   It's a remarkable thing that the Scriptures tell us nothing about the resurrection bodies
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.780]   of unbelievers.
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.860]   It tells us nothing about it, it's not interested in it.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.780]   All we know is, as we shall see, God willing, next Friday, that they are to be cast to the
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.220]   lake of destruction.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.660]   But we are told nothing more, but we are told a great deal about the resurrection bodies
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.140]   of the believers.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.300]   And this is what we are told.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.740]   Especially I'll confine my attention to 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.620]   Listen to this.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.960]   It will not be flesh and blood, remember.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.420]   This I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.420]   Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.520]   That's verse 50.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:03.140]   You notice that there is evidently a difference between flesh and blood and flesh and bones.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:09.120]   Our Lord calls attention to the fact after his resurrection that he's flesh and bones.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.280]   But Paul tells us that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.720]   So that the body will not be flesh and blood, but it will be flesh and bones.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.280]   We know that.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:28.440]   Secondly, we are told in verse 42 that it will be incorruptible.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.100]   It is sown in corruption.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:38.000]   It is raised in incorruption.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.300]   When I have received this resurrection body, I shall no longer be subject to disease.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.380]   I shall no longer be subject to age.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.000]   I shall no longer be subject to death.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.940]   My body will never decay.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.600]   It will never in any way change.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.400]   Sown in incorruption, this body is corruptible.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.320]   That will be incorruptible.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.360]   What a glorious prospect.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:10.000]   The second thing we are told about it is that it will be glorious.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.960]   It is sown in dishonor.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.600]   It is raised in glory.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   Paul refers to it as this, our vile body, or if you prefer it, this, the body of our
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.680]   humiliation.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.120]   There is nothing very glorious about our bodies, my friends, is there?
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.920]   We are poor specimens physically.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.040]   It's the result of sin, you know.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.040]   Yes, but when we are raised, we shall be like him.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.760]   It will be a glorious body, likened to the body of his glorification.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.800]   It will be a wonderfully glorious body.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.640]   The next thing I am told about it is this, that it will be a very powerful body.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.800]   It is sown in weakness.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.720]   It is raised in power.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.400]   What a wonderful thing.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.120]   There is nothing in a sense that I covet more than that.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.760]   The greatest hindrance to my preaching is the weakness of my body.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.040]   Oh, that I had a body to preach.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.800]   I can understand Charles Wesley crying out, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.400]   Redeemer's praise."
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:31.240]   We are so weak, we are so feeble, but it shall be raised in power, full of power, no vestige
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.880]   of weakness.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.560]   The next thing, and it is a very important one in verse 44, is this, that it is going
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.960]   to be a spiritual body.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.760]   It is sown a natural body.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.640]   It is raised a spiritual body.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.280]   There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.280]   What does he mean?
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.200]   What is the difference between this natural body and that spiritual body?
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:02.040]   Remember, that spiritual there does not mean, as I have been emphasizing, that there is
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.040]   not a body at all.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.240]   No, there will be a body, but it will be a spiritual body and not a natural one.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.040]   What is a natural body?
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:18.080]   Well, a natural body, you see, is a body that has the characteristics of an animal nature.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:24.760]   We are related to the animals, and our physical nature is animal, and it corresponds to the
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.040]   life that we live in this world.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:34.080]   We are soul in this world, and we live in relationships where the soul exercises itself,
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:40.680]   so that here we need a natural body, and we are given a natural body.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.440]   But when we go to the glory, we shall not need it.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.880]   Will there be a spiritual realm and a spiritual sphere?
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.920]   And there we shall be given this spiritual body.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.520]   And you know there are certain characteristics of it.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.520]   If you would like to know the difference between the animal and the spiritual, it is this.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.740]   Our Lord has already said it in a verse that I have quoted to you in his reply to the Sadducees
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.000]   about the seven brothers and the woman.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.240]   Jesus answered and said unto them, "Ye do her, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.240]   of God.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:24.680]   For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.440]   angels of God in heaven."
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:32.080]   There will be no sex life in heaven, no sex life in the risen, glorified, resurrected
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   body.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.360]   There is in this.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.760]   This is the natural body, the animal body.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.440]   There will be nothing of that there.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.000]   It will be a spiritual realm.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.360]   There will be no procreation there.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   We shall have no children there.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.460]   It will be spiritual then.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.620]   And you see the importance of emphasizing these things.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.080]   There are some people who think that if you are to be a really spiritual Christian, you
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.320]   must not be interested in the natural body.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.760]   That is rank heresy.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.720]   God has given us these natural bodies and he means us to use them.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   He has put sex and all the instincts in us and these things are to be used and employed
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.280]   in God's way.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:18.160]   So that a false asceticism is a denial of scriptural teaching and condemned by the scripture
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   itself.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:24.680]   But there, when we are raised, we will be in the spiritual realm.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:30.960]   And there, of course, we shall not need the animal, the natural, the spiritual only.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.760]   So the bodies will then be spiritual.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.000]   In other words, for me to close, the last thing we are told about these bodies of ours
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.020]   then is that they will be heavenly.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:49.120]   Of course, because we ourselves shall be in heaven.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:57.360]   Our bodies shall be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.280]   whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.120]   That when that day comes, says the apostle John in his first epistle, the third chapter,
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   second verse, we shall see him as he is.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   Yes, and thank God we shall be like him.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:26.640]   May I venture to add this, therefore, and because of this doctrine, we shall know one
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.520]   another.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.760]   You won't lose your identity.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.640]   It will be so different, absolutely changed.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:40.560]   This amazing miracle, changed in the twinkling of an eye, unless you are already dead.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.160]   But your identity will be preserved.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.600]   It will be you.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.520]   It will be I.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.900]   My salvation completed.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.880]   My spirit already saved.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.120]   My body then also perfectly redeemed.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:03.440]   The whole man entirely delivered from sin and evil.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.080]   O blessed, O glorious day.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.600]   O wonderful redemption.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.920]   O ineffable redeemer.
