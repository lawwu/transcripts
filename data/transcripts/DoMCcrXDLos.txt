[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Well, Pastor John and Noel have landed in South America.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.680]   Please join me in praying for them as they travel and minister in Brazil and
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.840]   Argentina and Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires and Campina Grande.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.120]   Of course, big international trips like this one also mean that we must release
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.040]   Pastor John from the podcast too.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.640]   And this is the last APJ with him for a while.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960]   If everything goes as planned, he'll be back in the States and back in the studio.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.480]   And we will be back with new episodes somewhere around March 18th, if my
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.080]   math is right, March 18th.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.160]   And if you are not, make sure you subscribe to the podcast and your favorite podcast
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.600]   app to get those episodes as soon as they are released.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.960]   But before Pastor John left for the airport, I had a chance to ask him one
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.880]   more APJ question.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.640]   Here's that episode.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.400]   But today's question is really good.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.000]   It arrives from a podcast listener named Hannah.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.520]   Dear Pastor John, first, thank you for your dedication to the teaching of the
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.840]   word.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.080]   The Lord has used your ministry in my life more than I can express.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.000]   I have a question about the way it seems that biblical persons, even God-fearing
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.280]   ones, seem to consider casting lots as a way to communicate with God.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.200]   Even the disciples cast lots to decipher God's will in choosing the 12th disciple.
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.920]   Is this morally commendable?
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.520]   Does this mean if I were to ask a question of God and then cast lots, such as rolling
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.920]   a dice, that answer counts as an accurate answer to his will?
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.240]   Just feels too easy.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.840]   Feels wrong and a bit like witchcraft.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.200]   But I don't see any prohibition of the practice in the New Testament either.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.880]   Pastor John, what would you say to Hannah?
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.640]   Is it morally right?
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:51.120]   So Hannah says, does this mean that if I were to ask a question of God and then cast
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.640]   lots or roll dice, that I can count on an accurate answer to his will?
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.880]   And then she adds, just doesn't feel right.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.320]   Too easy, wrong.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880]   I mean, she even says it's a bit like witchcraft.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.160]   But I don't see any prohibition of it in the New Testament, she says.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.120]   So Hannah, your instincts here are very good.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.840]   And your biblical assessment is right.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.960]   There is no prohibition in the Bible against casting lots.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.760]   That's true.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.320]   Just as important, there is no command in the Bible to cast lots.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   In the Old Testament, the frequent references to casting lots are almost always
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.680]   regarding the division of the land among the tribes of Israel, which they did by
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.000]   casting lots.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.680]   In the New Testament, there are only two mentions of casting lots.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.000]   One is ugly and the other is God approved.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.760]   The soldiers, you remember, cast lots for Jesus' clothes at the foot of the cross.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.600]   Just a horrible, callous moment.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.240]   And then in Acts 1, 21 following, the apostles did cast lots between Matthias and
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.000]   Joseph after they had applied all the proper criteria to try to make sure that we
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.280]   had two fit candidates to replace Judas as an apostolic witness to the resurrection.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.320]   Now, my answer to your question, if I were to ask a question of God, then roll dice,
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.720]   can I get an accurate answer?
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.760]   My answer to this is no.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.200]   Not only is there no command in the Bible to cast lots, there's no promise.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.160]   This is crucial to answer your question.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.520]   There's no promise in the Bible that if you do cast lots, you will get the right
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.040]   answer.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.600]   So no, rolling dice is no certain way to find the Lord's will.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.720]   You don't have a promise to that effect.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.560]   So I think you are right to be surprised, as I am in hearing you, and suspicious that
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.840]   certain people whom you say are otherwise godly put their stock in casting lots as a
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.880]   means of ordinary guidance in the Christian life.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.360]   I think that's crazy.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   In fact, I think we can say with strong authority and conviction that if someone
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.640]   makes this a pattern in their life, they are out of step with the Bible.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   And the reason I say that is because in all the instructions that we have for how to
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.480]   live a Christian life and how to make decisions and find and do the will of God in
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.080]   the whole New Testament, this is never mentioned, never, never, never mentioned as
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.760]   part of the way we're to go about discerning the Lord's will for our lives.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.680]   That would be very strange, wouldn't it, if it were a good and helpful practice?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.200]   I'm convinced it is not a good and helpful practice as part of the ordinary way of
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.240]   following Jesus, because what we get instead in the New Testament is a pattern of
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.920]   discernment that is different, very different than casting lots.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.240]   I'm give you three examples.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.560]   Here's the most familiar, Romans 12.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.960]   Two, don't be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.800]   mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.000]   acceptable and perfect.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.800]   So the pervasive pattern of discerning God's will is this.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.520]   It's rooted in a renewal of the mind.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.160]   This happens as we saturate our minds with God's Word and have our moral senses
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.280]   trained to discern what honors Christ and what doesn't, what loves people and what
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.800]   doesn't.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.040]   By the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.160]   The basic problem with casting lots—mark this now—the basic problem with casting
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.240]   lots is that it does not require any transformation of the mind at all.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.960]   A chimpanzee can do it.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.600]   A robot can do it.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.840]   In itself, there's nothing spiritual or holy about it.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.760]   It's not God's desire for us to do things that chimpanzees can do.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:45.480]   He wants us to become mature and conformed to his own character so that we see what is
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:53.680]   beautiful in Christ and in Christ's way, and then love it and then choose it.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.680]   But casting lots doesn't require that we see the beauty of holiness at all, which
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.800]   means that choosing it doesn't glorify God.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.640]   Do you see this?
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.320]   This is so central and foundational.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.360]   It glorifies chance.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:17.560]   But if you choose a path of behavior because you see its fitness as a way of
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:24.800]   glorifying God and honoring Christ and helping people, then Christ is honored when
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.080]   you choose it, and people are loved when you choose it.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.640]   That's what God's looking for, not in robotic ways of discerning a path.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.000]   Right.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.480]   Here's another example.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.720]   Philippians 1, 9, the prayer, "It's my prayer that your love may abound more and
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:48.280]   more with knowledge and all discernment so that you may approve what is excellent
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.240]   and so be pure and blameless in the day of Christ, filled with the fruits of
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.800]   righteousness that come through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God."
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:03.720]   If we try to be full of the fruits of righteousness by casting lots, we totally
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.880]   miss the point of what righteousness is.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.560]   It's the fruit of love mingled with knowledge and insight bathed in prayer
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.720]   and growing up into the glory of God.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.840]   That's not what casting lots does.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.440]   Here's one last example.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.520]   Ephesians 5, 8, "At one time you were darkness.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.720]   Now you are light in the Lord.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:39.240]   Walk as children of light, for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:46.080]   right and true, and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord."
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.160]   Ephesians 5, 8 to 10.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.920]   All of that would be canceled out, just canceled out by casting lots as an
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.120]   ordinary part of discernment.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:03.200]   When Paul says, "Try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord," he means go down
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.040]   deep into what it means to be children of the light and act according to your new
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.000]   nature.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.840]   So here's my conclusion.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:19.040]   Not only don't you have any certainty of pleasing God if you roll dice, you put
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:26.440]   yourself outside the beautiful pattern of New Testament transformation by the Spirit
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.240]   through the Word.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:34.440]   Christ wants you to glorify Him and His way by the way you make your choices.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.400]   But lots are mindless things.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.280]   God is not mindless.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.680]   You're not mindless.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.640]   Sanctification is not mindless.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.280]   Discernment is not mindless.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:53.440]   You have the mind of Christ, and you can see the beauty of holiness and glorify the
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.600]   Lord of holiness by choosing it for what it is.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.960]   Wonderful little survey on how we make God-honoring decisions.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.760]   And speaking of God's sovereignty over random chance, I talked with Vern
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.600]   Poythress a few years back on this same topic.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.480]   You can see what he adds to the conversation in episode 807, especially on
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:20.880]   Proverbs 16, 33, the idea that God still yet remains sovereign over every coin flip.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.520]   Really interesting stuff.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.000]   And then be sure to see him explain mathematically in the follow-up episode,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.840]   White Casinos Always Win, in the end.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.520]   That's episode number 808.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.320]   Those episodes and about 1,300 others can be found at our online home at

[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.120]   I am your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.600]   Please be praying for the Pipers now in South America.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.680]   Pray for their trip.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.480]   Pray that the Lord bless their ministry there and Lord willing, Pastor John
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.160]   will return to the studio with us around March 18th.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.240]   Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   Thank you for praying for Pastor John and for supporting our labor as a desiring God.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.440]   We'll see you soon enough.
