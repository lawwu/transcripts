[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   In psychology, it's not the past that determines the present.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.160]   It's actually the present that determines
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.360]   the meaning of the past.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.160]   And this is like a fundamental mindset
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.240]   when it comes to healing trauma, things like that,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.040]   is that my past isn't what's determining who I am now.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.760]   Actually, it's who I am now that determines
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.960]   the meaning of my past.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.080]   And the more you get really good at that,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.360]   the more you can continuously transform your past in ways
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.320]   that it is happening for you rather than happening to you.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.320]   But if you listen to most people's language,
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.520]   they still blame their past for why they are the way they are
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.400]   right now rather than taking ownership
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.520]   that it's actually you right now that are shaping
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.120]   the story, the narrative, the frame, the view of your past.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.160]   It's not the past that determines the present.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.000]   It's the present that determines the past.
