[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   you can tell when Buffett has gotten disengaged with a company based on the number of times he
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.840]   mentions it in his annual letter. This is the number of times Apple was mentioned. He went
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   from basically saying Apple was the absolute end all and be all and it's gone from basically a
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.320]   bunch of times to almost none. What's interesting about that is the last time that that happened was
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.920]   with drumroll Wells Fargo over 15 and 20 years Buffett built up a huge position until he realized
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.480]   that that company was not really one of his forever stocks. And the number of times it was
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.960]   mentioned in his letter went to zero. So I think this Buffett index is a really important one for
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.080]   Apple, which is it went from a forever holding that he said he would own forever to barely
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.720]   getting mentioned. Unfortunately, it speaks for a very bad next five to 10 years for this company,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.760]   unless they figure something out.
