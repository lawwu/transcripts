[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   A Psalm of David.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.960]   Yahweh is my shepherd I shall not want.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.040]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.480]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.580]   He restores my soul.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.800]   He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.600]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for you are
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.960]   with me.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.300]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.440]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.000]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.280]   My cup overflows.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.280]   Surely goodness and loving kindness will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will dwell
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.560]   in the house of Yahweh forever.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.560]   Amen.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.620]   you
