[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   [Music]
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.240]   You're watching ABC News Breakfast.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.320]   Microsoft users are being warned they might need to switch from the world's most popular web browser Internet Explorer to another system.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.040]   Experts are warning there's a serious security flaw that may allow hackers to access personal information.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   So to explain just what this means for you and your PC, we're joined in the studio now by IT expert Jeremy Howard.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.040]   Jeremy, good morning.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.520]   Good morning.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.560]   Now, this isn't entirely a new allegation or fear, is it? What sparked it today?
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.880]   Well, look, to be honest, for years security experts have been warning everybody to stop using Internet Explorer and start using something else.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.280]   Firefox being the one usually suggested.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.920]   This is because Internet Explorer has years of critical problems, which is putting people's data at risk.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   Their internet banking passwords, for instance.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.440]   The big problem today is that there is a very widely used exploit that you can't avoid if you use Internet Explorer.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.200]   It's hitting people hard.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   Already many, many people, hundreds of thousands of people on the internet have been affected.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.000]   So how serious a threat is this?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.960]   If you're logging onto your computer this morning at home to check your bank account, there's no way you should be using Internet Explorer?
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.520]   That's right.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.880]   And normally I like to come on and talk about solutions and things people can do.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.920]   But today I can't.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.720]   It's very difficult because for me to say go and get Firefox, the first thing you might say is, oh, I haven't got it.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.440]   I'll go and download it.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.760]   There's a problem already.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.880]   Because you've used your Explorer to download it.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.600]   OK, I'll just update Windows.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.400]   Well, A, there is no update currently which fixes this problem.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.200]   Microsoft have known about it for a few weeks and still haven't fixed it.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.880]   And furthermore, even to download the fix, you would have to use Internet Explorer.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.280]   What does it actually do?
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.120]   What's the problem?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.840]   Well, the problem is it's a generic problem called an exploit, which means that anybody can get into your computer and do whatever they want.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.480]   Now, currently, most of the exploits of this particular problem, it's not a big deal.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.880]   They're stealing computer game passwords.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:21.680]   But the problem is once that person's code is in your computer, they can go back later or they can often what happens is they'll sell what's called a botnet of infected computers to the criminal underground for lots of money.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.000]   And then they go in and steal all of the banking passwords or use it to attack other computers or so forth.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.160]   So are you aware of any incidences in Australia using this system where people's personal information has been stolen?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.640]   We can't know yet exactly what the hackers have done with the information.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.960]   I do know that there are plenty of people in Australia that visit some of the tens of thousands of infected websites.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   It's as simple as going to a website which somebody else has already hacked into that can cause this problem.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.720]   So we don't know what's being done with these exploits yet.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.600]   But the problem is once you've been infected, even a patch can't fix it.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.560]   You have to scrub your whole computer and start again.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200]   There's no known way to fix an infected computer.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:22.400]   Now, not wanting to promote one brand over the other this morning here on the ABC, there's been a long been a discussion about whether Macs are now going to overtake the PC in terms of popularity and also security because they're less prone to viruses.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   Is this one more death blow for Microsoft for those operating systems?
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   Look, in this case, it's about the web browser Internet Explorer.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:41.920]   If you don't use that and there are others like Firefox and Opera and Google's got a new one called Chrome, which are all they're more secure, they're faster and they've got more features.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.280]   So for years, Internet experts have been saying use one of these browsers instead.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.000]   Eight out of 10 people still use Internet Explorer.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.360]   Zero out of 10 security researchers use Internet Explorer.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.400]   Using a Mac is another good way to avoid this problem.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.640]   But of course, you might have all kinds of reasons like sharing office documents at work, which might need you to use a PC.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.320]   Jeremy, thanks for the advice that you could give us this morning.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.640]   Thank you.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.840]   Serious warning this morning.
