[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast. And this episode I have a
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.760]   special guest with me, Farnoosh Tarabi, who is the author of A Healthy State of Panic
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.120]   coming out October 3rd, 2023. Say hello.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.400]   Hello, everybody. Sam, I'm such a fan. I loved when you came on So Money, and I'm honored
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.240]   to meet now, you know, try to repay the favor somehow on your show. I hope I'm as good as
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.600]   you were on So Money.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.000]   No, no, no. Thank you for supporting my book, Buy This, Not That. It was great, and I'm
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.760]   glad it's over. But how about you? You know, you've been working on this book since for
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760]   a while now.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.960]   Well, honestly, I say it's the culmination of my 40 plus years being alive and putting
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.780]   one foot in front of the other. This book is about money, but it's also about so many
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.760]   things because as you know, when we talk about money, we are talking about life. We are talking
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.800]   about relationships and work and our relationship to money, how we were raised, our childhoods.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.960]   And so, yeah, I'm excited to bring this book to everybody. It's been nine years since I've
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.840]   published. This is my fourth book, but I've waited, I guess, all this time because I needed
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.800]   it to sort of unpack the years and the lessons learned. And what I discovered is that, you
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.480]   know, as I've been podcasting and writing and being in the personal finance space for
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.640]   a really long time, one of the biggest questions I get is sort of like, "How did you become
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.760]   you? How did you know how to make certain decisions in your life?" And even on my podcast,
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   I have a show, an episode I dedicate every week to people asking me questions, and the
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.160]   questions are not just about money. It's about everything. I think people somehow, for some
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.560]   reason, trust me with a lot of important questions in their lives, their crossroads. And I think
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.480]   when I sort of examine my own journey and what has helped navigate me, the truth of
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.200]   it is that I'm a terrified woman, Sam. I'm a scared woman. And the world's a scary place,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.240]   and I accept that. And I have an early education in fear as the daughter of immigrants. And
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.760]   so I think that the thesis here, as I was developing the book, I was like, "I think
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.800]   the thesis is that fear is my superpower. How about that? How about them apples?" And
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.400]   then I just had so many stories to back it up. And not just mine, but people who have
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.060]   graced the podcast who have perhaps not even unknowingly realized on the show they realized
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.120]   when we talk about it, like, "Oh my gosh, I did the really hard thing while I was scared.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.240]   I was scared and still did the thing." And so unpacking that, exploring that, realizing
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.440]   that maybe fear was fuel. Maybe fear was the wisdom you needed. It gave you a sense of
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   who you were at the time and how to make a really aligned, self-aligned decision. And
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.840]   so, yeah, that was a longer answer probably than you were anticipating, but you'll learn
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.080]   quickly that I don't give short answers.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.360]   >> What are some of the fears or the most common fears that you've discovered or your
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.680]   own fears that have prevented you but that also have propelled you towards your financial
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.920]   success, career success, parental success and so forth?
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.560]   >> Well, fear is abundant and it is a universal feeling, but it is very personal to everyone.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.400]   I mean, what I tried to do in the book was not just talk about fear as this monolith,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.880]   but to your point, like there are many different types of fears. We don't demystify it. We
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.280]   say it's just this thing and we should ignore it. We should be fearless. But I think if
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.960]   you really examine it, there are these specific types of fears. And like I said, there are
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.000]   many, many, but for the book and how I designed the book was based on what I felt not only
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.200]   was something that I've experienced in the department of fear, but I think is to some
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.320]   extent relatable to a lot of people. And so there's the fear of rejection is the opening
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   chapter in the book. And that's something that I think as young people, as children
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.880]   especially, that's one of our first acquaintances with fear. We want to be liked, we want to
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.160]   be popular, we want to be accepted. And then there's the fear of loneliness, which also
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.260]   in some ways for me at least did source in childhood. But as we know, it is an epidemic
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.040]   now in adulthood. It is a real, real problem. Then I talk about FOMO because you can't talk
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.880]   about the current day and modern life without exploring FOMO and the fear of missing out.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.560]   There's the fear of exposure, which is a chapter that I almost didn't write. I was afraid of
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.680]   the chapter, if you believe, I was afraid of writing about this fear because I didn't
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.600]   want it to be misunderstood. I think I did a good job by the end of it. But this is the
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.080]   fear of being found out for who you really are in front of an audience that may not be
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:11.000]   accepting, that may not be patient, that may not use that information to support you, but
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.960]   rather to use it against you. And there are many examples that I share in that chapter
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.800]   and the ones that really for me were exemplary of this is, I mean, I'm Iranian. I was born
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.000]   there. My parents are both Iranians. I'm 100% Iranian and I was raised, born originally
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.880]   on the East Coast in Worcester, Massachusetts, where I didn't really share a likeness in
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.520]   many of my friends, at least not culturally or religiously or any of that. So I got a
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.960]   little triggered when people are like, "Where are you from?" Because I don't know the motivation
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.820]   behind that question. And when that fear of being exposed, let's say, for being different
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.240]   pops up, it rears its head, it's not telling me to hide. It's not telling me to lie. Of
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.400]   course, it's not telling me to deny him who I am, but it's saying, "Take a minute and
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.600]   recognize the motivation behind that question, who is asking and why they want to know this
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.400]   personal information about you." And whether it's about an aspect of your identity or it
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:22.420]   is your finances, I think that we owe it to ourselves to hold what is sacred to ourselves.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.420]   And until we feel safe and until we feel like we are in a trustworthy community, that we
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.600]   go there. I mean, this chapter really came about because we live in a world where being
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.220]   vulnerable is what we think is like the most courageous thing. And I believe that to an
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.500]   extent, but I think that that narrative has gotten confusing over the years, especially
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.060]   with social media and reality TV. We feel like we have to talk about all the things.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.940]   I mean, even in our profession, Sam, the number of people who share their revenue streams,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.740]   like the actual dollars behind what they make. And I love that transparency, but I think
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:08.080]   it should be an individual choice. You should not feel pressured to share all the minutia
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.140]   of your life because you think that's what's going to win you acceptance. Unfortunately,
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.340]   not all circles are inviting and warm. And I mean, I was at a conference on stage and
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.900]   someone said, "How much do you make?" Now, it was a conference about content creation
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.300]   and we were talking specifically about earning your worth. So, touche to the person in the
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.580]   audience who asked me that. And I was like, "You should be transparent." She's like,
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.540]   "Okay, well, how much do you make?" And I'm in front of 100, 200 people. I don't know
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.380]   who they are. Is this the time and place to be talking about all the money that I have
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:51.260]   in my bank account? And I said, "I respect the question. It's not that I don't want to
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.220]   share it, but I think that if you really want to know because there's something on the line
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.660]   for you that this information would be helpful to you, let's get a coffee after this." And
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.980]   so we met downstairs in the Starbucks and I invited others who wanted to come into that
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.940]   conversation. But I think in that moment, I was scared. Oh, my gosh. The fear could
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:17.180]   have just made me blab as fear sometimes does without this recognition of like, "Oh, hey
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:23.020]   fear, you're here. What do you want me to do? How can I protect myself in this moment?"
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.620]   And I protected myself. I'm very proud of that moment. Maybe I couldn't take credit
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.380]   for it in the moment, but that was definitely how fear showed up for me that day. And not
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.940]   only just that day, but since that coffee with that one person, we have continued that
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:41.380]   dialogue about how much we make, what we earn, what we charge, as I found that it was very
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.460]   helpful for me to be connected to her too. So there's so many gifts with fear that we
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:54.300]   sometimes undermine, overlook, discount. And this book is about rebranding fear because
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:01.020]   we all fear things. And I think to be fearless is a strange privilege that you have. I'm
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:07.180]   very well aware of risks and the costs and what things cost and how to afford things.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.420]   And I don't know. I don't want or need to go and do all the things in the name of fearlessness.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.060]   Yeah. I have a good answer for you if someone asks you about how much you make in the future.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.540]   You just say, "Well, I make between a dollar and a billion dollars. Somewhere there."
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.460]   I love that. I'm going to steal that. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. That's great. That's great.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.340]   It's a fear. I mean, I've definitely felt a lot of fear doing this podcast, writing
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.180]   a book, putting my thoughts out there on the internet. And the funny thing is the larger
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.980]   you grow, the more negativity you attract, also positivity for sure. But even if you
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.820]   have 1% negativity and you have a large audience, it kind of beats you up a little. So do you
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:55.740]   ever have times? So for listeners, you have an amazing podcast. I think you have over
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:02.980]   a thousand episodes, So Money podcast. How do you deal with that kind of criticism and
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:08.860]   the negativity as you keep on going forward wanting to keep providing value?
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.180]   It's such a good question and I address this in the book because it comes up quite a bit.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.260]   You can imagine, I do put myself out there. So you do have to have a little bit of a thick
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.780]   skin. And I remember when I was starting out in the online space and I would, for some
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.580]   reason, don't do this anyway. Don't read the blog comments. I mean, just ... And I used
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.820]   to work at Yahoo. So you know those weren't the most ... Those weren't high quality, let's
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.820]   just say.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.060]   That's pretty intense.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:40.740]   It was my manager who said, "For every negative review, there's probably five people that
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.380]   loved what you did and agreed with what you did, but they just didn't write a review because
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.460]   that's just not the nature of reviews." Yelp, for example, right? It's mostly people who
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:57.580]   are upset with the product or the service. But probably exponentially more people were
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.700]   fine with it, but they just didn't think it would be helpful or wasn't worth their time
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.940]   to write a review. They weren't triggered to write a review, let's just say.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.460]   So I've known that all along, but even still, I do admit that fear shows up a lot in my
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.220]   work, especially when I take on stances and something that you and I even talked about
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:21.420]   on my show about how I believe firmly in female financial independence. I mean, I'm a feminist
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:28.460]   and I think we can all agree that women deserve to make as much as men, to earn their value.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.460]   Definitely.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.400]   I'm preaching to the choir here, I know. But if I believe this, then I can't actually also
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:44.980]   say to women, "You should opt out of working forever to raise your children." I think that
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:51.000]   that is a risk, right? So many people do it. And I understand you have to take time out
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.980]   of the workforce and sometimes you just want to take time out of the workforce and you
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:12:01.780]   should do what you want to do. But whenever I am asked, "What do I think about people,"
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.740]   and this applies to dads too, who have done the math and they realize, "Oh, well, I don't
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.900]   make childcare as exceeding my income or it's about the same as my income and I should just
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:17.740]   stay home." I say, "That is not untrue math, but it also should not be the only thing that
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:25.060]   you consider as you do the calculus for whether or not to leave the workforce for an indefinite
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.060]   period."
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:32.580]   "Have a plan," I say, or "Have savings, try to have savings." So I say these things and
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.380]   of course, I'm sure you'll get some hate mail, sorry, in advance. People are like, "Oh, you're
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:48.420]   just so anti-family," or the list goes on. And I have gotten a little bit better at receiving
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:55.780]   those criticisms, but what I've also learned is that my response, my fear is that, I fear
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.580]   of being misunderstood, right? I fear being sort of branded as like this villain. But
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.060]   what I've learned is that the follow-up to those criticisms and that place of fear, my
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:12.080]   job is to protect my reputation and protect my integrity and to clarify because maybe
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.340]   this person didn't understand and maybe I didn't do a good job of explaining. And so
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.340]   I say, "Look, it's coming from a good place. It's coming from the place of me wanting to
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.380]   ensure that all people, particularly women who have been stripped of their financial
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:33.060]   freedoms for generations, do what they can to protect those financial freedoms." And
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:41.420]   that's it. And so to deny, to say that there is no risk in not working and taking care
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.780]   of your kids, there's no financial risk, I think is fraught. And that's all I'm saying.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.900]   At the end of the day, it's their choice, but you asked me, so there's my opinion. I
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:57.300]   will also say that with fear of exposure in that case, I'm exposing my ideas and worrying
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.660]   about the backlash, I'm very specific and deliberate about where I share those things.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.300]   I do it on the podcast. I do it in books. I do it amongst people that have come to me
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:15.140]   with true open-mindedness. I don't go into comments sections and start arguing with people
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:20.820]   about it. You know what I mean? I have realized that when the fear of exposure shows up, the
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.140]   important thing is that you read the room and you become more deliberate about where
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.220]   you share your information. I know that people who show up for my podcast, as they do on
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:34.560]   your show, they're committed. They don't always agree with you, but they are more or less
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:43.460]   there to have a quality back and forth. And they're respectful. And I love when people
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.100]   say, "I didn't totally agree with what you said, but I understand where you're coming
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.700]   from and here's my side of the story." Beautiful. Same with books. People have paid money to
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.900]   read my books or they went to the library and checked out the book. There was an effort
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:03.420]   in acquiring that book. And so I have to believe that that is an audience member who is more
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.020]   willing to be patient and open-minded. And so I feel safer to talk about some of these
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.380]   more triggering things and these more controversial things where I feel like we're not going to
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:21.620]   end up in a brawl. There won't be pitchforks. Yeah. Well, for the record, I feel that financial
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:28.180]   dependence on someone is kind of the worst feeling. And I absolutely believe a man and
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.620]   woman should have separate and joint accounts because before you guys met, you guys are
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.660]   independent adults. And it's kind of weird to depend on one person financially for the
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.460]   rest of your lives. Bad things happen all the time. The divorce rate is about 50%. And
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:48.260]   if you haven't been working for 8, 9, 10 years, raising your child and suddenly you're thrown
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.500]   back into the workforce, you might be in a little bit of hurt financially. So always
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.540]   think about yourself, protect yourself, obviously protect your family as well. Thank you for
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.820]   echoing that. It's really important for men to share that message too. I feel like this
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.980]   is a conversation that goes on and on and on in women's circles. And it's really important
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:14.780]   that everybody recognizes that when mothers and women have financial independence, it's
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:20.340]   good for everybody. It's like win for everybody. She wins, her children win, the family unit
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.420]   wins. And I get it. There are going to be periods of time where you don't work and don't
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:30.300]   want to work. But to never say never. I'm never going to go back into the workforce.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:36.500]   I think that's not a safe plan. And too often, I mean, the reason I also say this stuff isn't
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:43.340]   just my guesswork. I get so many testimonials from men and women that say, "I wish I had
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:50.460]   just maybe saved some money before I decided to stay home or I continue to have a revenue
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.780]   stream or had a plan to get back into the workforce, continue to have relationships
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:00.260]   with colleagues." There's no downside there, folks. As a father of a three and a half year
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:06.820]   old daughter, I am definitely excited about raising her and seeing her grow up and mature.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:13.420]   As a mother and as a woman, what are some of the things that us dads or parents should
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.180]   think about as we raise our daughters to be adults?
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:24.340]   Well, one thing that I have learned from my guests on So Money, one of the questions I
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:29.100]   often ask them and the women in particular will say, when I ask them, "What's one
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.660]   thing you wish you had learned about money growing up?" And a lot of my women guests
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.500]   might say something like, "I wish I was told that personal finance isn't just about
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.780]   budgeting and saving, that it is also about investing, that entrepreneurship is a viable
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:50.460]   path and that there are no limits to what I can do and where I can show up in the financial
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.700]   world." I think that even if the message at home is positive or neutral about money
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:01.140]   with your kids, the culture doesn't do a great job. So you almost have to over-index
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:09.420]   at home because the culture still depicts and paints a portrait of a very traditional
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:17.140]   model where money is a man's domain and men are the ones who are earning more or
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:23.260]   all of the money and more interested or better at investing, which as we know is not even
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:30.180]   true. More women are increasingly breadwinners in their families, more women in their 20s
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:36.780]   own property than men, they're the same ages, women are actually better investors.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:45.700]   So I think that to the extent that you can repeat these facts to your daughters and sons,
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:51.540]   I think is important because the culture is yet, it's slow to recognize that they are
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.380]   feeding our generation, our next generation with falsehoods and myths that is continuing
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:03.820]   to perpetuate this dynamic where women don't feel confident and we wonder why. Women don't
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.060]   feel confident about money, we wonder why. It's because they're just not invited as
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.640]   much into these conversations and they're told that this is not their domain whether
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.580]   it's directly or indirectly they're told this. So I think that's a big one and I
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.500]   have a boy and a girl, I have a son who's 9 and a daughter who's 6 and it's interesting
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:31.220]   to see even this early on their unique relationships to money and when they each get let's say
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:36.420]   birthday money or some like tooth fairy money like what each of them instinctively does
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.420]   with that money.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.420]   Yeah, what do they do?
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:44.740]   And so my son will immediately want to go to Target and my daughter will save it. I
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:51.260]   went into her room the other day because I needed to pay our cleaning team. I was short
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:57.900]   like 5 or 10 dollars and she just had a stash of, she's 6, she had a stash of money. I
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.700]   don't want to say, look, she's a smart cookie but I don't think she's like, "Oh,
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.280]   I better save my money because I'm going to buy a bike one day." I think she just
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.780]   puts it away and forgets it because she's just got her hands on a lot of things. But
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:19.660]   I think that when you recognize certain inclinations in your kids around money, have that be a
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:26.260]   learning moment, a teachable moment or a discussion point. I think that's interesting. I guess
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:32.020]   the takeaway is watch your kids. They will tell you what they need to learn. Some kids
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:37.180]   need to be more schooled in things like saving whereas others maybe if they're already good
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.980]   teachers, maybe we should talk to them about conscious spending and investing. It's interesting.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.380]   Kids are always full of surprises, right?
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:54.580]   Right. I do like what you say about being aware of basically our biases, our blind spots
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:00.460]   in terms of parenting and how we treat boys and girls differently if at all and to over
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.780]   index if we find that we are deficient in one way. I know that when I see my daughter,
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:10.020]   I just want to hug her and squeeze her and kiss her. Then when I see my son, I want to
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.140]   hug him and squeeze him too but we kind of are more rough and tumble a little bit. It's
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.140]   just a different dynamic but I think if we can treat them equally and approach money
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.740]   equally and explain why we do the things that we do with our money, I think that can go
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.740]   a long way.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.140]   Yes. Yeah. It's so good. We could do many multiple episodes on kids and money which
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:38.540]   I have. But one of the takeaways I love, one of my favorite experts when it comes to money
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:45.460]   and kids is Susan Beacham. She was the first person I profiled for Money Magazine when
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:52.740]   I became a writer on staff years ago. She was at the time based in Chicago. She started
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:22:00.500]   a financial literacy company for kids. Now imagine this is like 2000 or like 1999. She
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:07.100]   was ahead of it and she took her kids to a McDonald's shareholders meeting in Chicago
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.860]   and then later took them to McDonald's and kind of explained. This was like kindergartners
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.780]   I think. But then she developed the Money Savvy Pig which you've probably seen. It's
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:22.940]   a piggy bank that's see-through that has four slots, save, spend, donate, invest. When I've
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.420]   had her on the show and she's like a lifelong friend and I've had her on the show and I
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.020]   said obviously she has many tips. But the one thing that always stays with me is that
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.100]   this idea because so many adults grew up with this mentality of financial scarcity, Sam,
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:42.500]   like I'll never have enough or I can't afford it or I'll never reach that goal. It starts
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.580]   young. It starts sometimes at home when a child comes to us and say, "I'd like a bike
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:53.820]   or I'd like to go get tennis lessons or I need money for X, Y, or Z." We say to them,
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:23:00.420]   "No, we don't have the money or we can't afford that." And maybe you can but that's
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.740]   just what you say to think you want to just stop the conversation. But the truth may be
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:12.020]   that you have other priorities. So tell them the truth. Tell them the truth. Explain that
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:18.000]   I love that you have this goal. At the moment, this is not something that our family can
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.340]   prioritize and explain. Go deep. Kids are more capable of absorbing this stuff than
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:30.140]   we give them credit for. They want reasons. Why, why, why, why, why? They want to know.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:37.460]   And rather than give them a dead end to that desire, that wanting for something, make them
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:43.980]   put it on a list. Or if they can't write yet, have them draw it. And what it does is it
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.540]   when it recognizes the wanting. Because here's the other thing I've had guests on my show
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:56.260]   who've talked about patriarchy and women and just how women have for so long been told
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:02.460]   it's just not appropriate to want for things. That it's not virtuous to want money, to want
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:09.260]   success. And so that starts young too. And when we tell, especially when a girl hears,
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.420]   "No, it's not right to want that or you can't have that or we can't have that or we can't
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.860]   afford that." It sort of tells her like, "Maybe that's not appropriate or I shouldn't want
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:24.900]   that or I'll never have that." And instead, we want to keep the door open and just let
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:30.900]   her and him know that right now this isn't a priority for our family, but let's find
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:36.620]   a way to save for it. What can we do? What can you do? What are some chores you can do?
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.980]   Or what are the holidays that are coming up? I mean, I'm guilty of this too sometimes because
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:48.620]   sometimes you just want to shut down the conversation. And kids forget things. Let's not forget that.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:54.740]   They want things all the time. I think recognizing it, respecting their wants, but also recognizing
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:25:00.620]   that in two days' time, they will be on to something else and you're off the hook. Trust
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.540]   that. Trust that. I've learned that over the years.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:11.100]   How do you juggle the things that you do? So motherhood, you're taking your kids to
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.700]   camp today. You talked about that and then you've got the podcast and then you've got
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:21.620]   the book. You've got to market the book. It seems like a lot of work and it seems overwhelming.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.940]   So how do you manage it all and do you manage it all and do you have some tips for people
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.880]   who are struggling with everything as well?
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.940]   If you were on Instagram today, you may have noticed I was running to this podcast because
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.140]   I went for a stroll this morning for some me time. I was like, "Oh, I'm going to go
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.420]   for a walk into town, return some library books, get a coffee." And then I was like,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.140]   "Oh no, 20 minutes till the podcast." And it's about an 18-minute walk from where I
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:53.180]   was so I'm starting to power walk. And then I posted that on Instagram. I was like, "This
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.500]   is also good content." So this is the life, a day in the life of a woman who's rushing
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:07.140]   to a podcast. But no, I mean, man, I've been in this industry for 20 years.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.220]   So I've learned along the way. I learned very early on the importance of help, asking for
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.500]   help. I was actually an assistant. My first job was I was assisting a financial expert.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:24.900]   And before that, we maybe called them influencers or experts but this person was a very famous,
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.260]   well-known at the time, money expert. She had written many books. She was on the Today
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:34.180]   Show all the time. She was an editor. And I had the amazing job of being able to witness
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:41.140]   all the things that she did, how she did it. She had two kids and was married at the time
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:48.100]   and all these amazing accomplishments. And I realized what I was doing for her, right,
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:53.660]   to support her. And so when I grew in my career and felt like I had reached a place where
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.380]   I was, again, really busy like this, like my former boss was and doing all these things,
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:04.220]   books and television and all that, I hired someone like me that was my former self I
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:09.500]   hired for a period of time. And that was immensely helpful. I think that for me, what I've learned
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:15.900]   is that you don't need consistent full-time help all the time. But when your life speeds
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.860]   up or when you're really pivoting to something big and different, that it's really important
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:27.100]   to maybe have a consistent team. And I've never had big teams, people say they've got
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:32.180]   20 people or 11 interns. And that just gives me a lot of anxiety, to be honest, because
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:37.540]   I don't like to manage. I don't like to tell people what to do. I don't like to micromanage.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:44.540]   And so that's on me. Maybe other people can do that. I prefer to just maybe have some
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.620]   freelancers who are contractors who work for me. Again, I did have a full-timer at one
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:54.260]   point. Life teaches you a lot about what's worth wasting your time on and what's not.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:28:00.620]   So I like to think that part of what helps me manage my day these days is just recognizing
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:07.580]   all the failures in the past and all the time wasters and what I can do versus what I can't
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.780]   do, what I like to do versus what I don't like to do. I just hired a virtual assistant
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:20.900]   because I realized there's a lot of busy work around a book launch that is important but
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   can't be done only by me. And so it's important for me to know exactly what I need this person
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.220]   to do before I hire them. And I waited and people are like, "You don't have an assistant?"
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:37.140]   I said, "I'm just not sure what I would have this person do yet. I have a vague idea, but
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.020]   let me get a little bit closer to the demands. And then I want to be able to hit the ground
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.780]   running with this virtual assistant." And so that's been great for a couple of months
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:52.980]   now. And I'm not hiring a publicist this time for the book launch, which might shock people.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:58.780]   I'm leaning on the in-house publishers publicist who's fantastic, Holly. I'm leaning on my
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.140]   virtual assistant and I'm leaning on my 20 years of working in the media and all the
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:09.060]   relationships that I had. And what has helped to get these to transpire, these opportunities
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.940]   is just starting early. I've learned that. You don't contact a podcaster or any news
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:20.660]   outlet or any media outlet no later than I would say two months, three months out because
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.140]   you don't know other people's timelines and schedules.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:30.700]   I have had a nanny since my kids were born. No longer we don't have full-time childcare
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.340]   or even part-time childcare anymore. The kids are in school and they have afterschool things.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.940]   We both work from home. That's a privilege to be able to not have that commute and to
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:48.340]   be accessible to like throw in laundry and pick up your kids. I wouldn't trade that workflow
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:55.180]   for anything. I mean, if someone said to me, "We'll pay you millions of dollars and you'll
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:01.860]   have to come into New York City every week," I'd say, "Could we throw in a car service?"
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:10.660]   And maybe, I don't know. I don't know. I don't think I would do it, Sam. I'm not 25 anymore.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.940]   I really don't know how people did it before the pandemic.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.820]   No other option.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:20.580]   It wasn't an option and I guess we just didn't know a better life. And of course, our employers
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.660]   wouldn't have budged either at the time. I don't know. Does that help? Does that fill
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.020]   in some blanks for you?
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.420]   Sure. Yeah. Get help.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.580]   I cry a lot in the shower. Is that also, does that count? I release a lot of my trauma.
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.220]   I take power walks. I lift weights.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:43.940]   Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. You run around, lift weights and get those emotions out and
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:48.220]   talk to people. I think talking to people is good therapy too. Very good therapy because
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.900]   we're all going through something and if we can empathize and connect with people who
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.940]   go through similar things as we do, I think it feels great.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:05.140]   Yes. Oh my gosh. My mother is, well, she and I are only 19 years apart. So she's in her
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.140]   60s.
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.140]   That's a blessing.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:13.580]   I know. Really it is. I mean, she's, it didn't always feel that way. But I think I have really
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:20.460]   over the years appreciated our closeness in age. And I love having women friends who are
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:27.020]   in their 50s and 60s and 70s. I think that is my advice to everybody is to find an elder
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.900]   in your life that you can talk to consistently because, and my mother used to do this when
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:40.180]   I was little. She, I say in my book, she loves old, old things. You know, she loves old movies.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:45.940]   She loves grandparents. She just loves to be around older people. And I think it's because
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.580]   she appreciates the wisdom so much. And I appreciate one thing my mother said to me
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:57.140]   recently, which is that as you get older, Farnoosh, there are only a few things that
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:04.320]   matter in terms of your health, your spirit, your longevity. And she said one is socializing.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.900]   My mother's always been a social butterfly. I'm, people think I'm an extrovert and I guess
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:17.780]   I, I'm an actress at heart. I get on stage and I will do the part. I will play the role
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.900]   and I will play it from the heart and the soul. But I think afterwards I'm so exhausted.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.380]   That has to mean that I'm not.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.140]   I don't know. I mean, you've been on TV, you do the podcast. It's a lot of work.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.220]   I'm really great at connecting with people. I've been trained well since a kid. We moved
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:38.020]   a lot. I just always was the new girl. So I immediately have to find ways to find connection.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.940]   And so that's definitely like one of my superpowers, I think. It was out of necessity, a survival
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.980]   instinct in me perhaps. And so I do say that that is there, but I love just like being
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:52.380]   in my pajamas at home and, and I was supposed to go to a pool party tomorrow and they just
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.860]   canceled and part of me is a little sad, but I'm like, oh my God, I have the whole day
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.580]   back. That sounds great. So I got to be more proactive about socializing. And so my mother,
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.700]   you know, she helps to remind me of those things. It's important. And she's like, you
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.980]   know, your, your health comes first. And back to parenting. I think it's so important for
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.860]   parents to put themselves first. It is really, really hard. Not all the time we can do this,
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:23.140]   but to at least acknowledge that your feelings matter. Your energy is not an infinite resource.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.980]   You have to protect your energy and your time when you're happy. You know, this sounds cliche.
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.300]   I think the kids are happy and vice versa. They say you're only as happy, you're only
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.740]   as happy as your saddest kid. Yeah, no, that's true. It's very true. And I think it's very
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:44.300]   reciprocal. I think that my kids feed off my energy and vice versa. So you, everybody's
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   important. The whole, every person in the family deserves equal attention and opportunity.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:57.180]   Yeah. When, when we're down in my household, our saying is we're well for my wife and me,
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.980]   we're doing the best that we can. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's, if we're doing the best that
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:06.380]   we can, you can't do better. You can. I mean, I talk about fear of failure in the book and
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:12.540]   what it's actually trying to help us recognize is that maybe you have to, one, there's many
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.420]   things, but maybe it's that you have to redefine your definition of success because you're
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:21.140]   after the wrong things and you're feeling failure because this isn't what you were actually
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:27.020]   meant to go out and achieve. But as far as parenting, I mean, I always, I feel, I feel
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.260]   like a failure every day with, I mean, there's a moment at least, you know, where I'm like,
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.020]   "Oh, I messed that up." Well, you know, that's going to leave a mark. But there's this crazy
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:40.700]   story in the book and I've shared this online and I think it resonated, but one time I sent
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:46.500]   my kids to the wrong birthday party and left them there for a couple of hours with their
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:51.580]   babysitter. And my first thought was, "Oh my God, I'm the worst parent." Second thought
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:57.100]   was, "I should do this more often." Because sometimes what I realized that from that experience
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.920]   is like the kids still had a great time. Nobody was hurt. We did call the venue to follow
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:07.100]   up and make sure that we hadn't inadvertently charged this family like extra money for these
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.540]   two by two rando kids who showed up. Extra pizza.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:15.740]   Yeah. And I realized this, it was a soccer venue. I was like, "This place has birthday
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.380]   parties around the clock on Saturdays and Sundays. I live down the street. Like if I
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.660]   ever need just peace and quiet, I'm dropping my kids off with some gifts and they're going
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:29.460]   to go hang out with some random birthday kid." It's a joke, but not really. But the real
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:35.540]   takeaway there is that sometimes failing is the point because the thing that really just
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:42.380]   transpired from all of that was laughter and recognizing that life is just so crazy sometimes
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.420]   and as long as the kids are okay, nothing else matters.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:51.980]   Right. Right. Now when we talk about failure, but I'd love to get your definition of success
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:57.020]   and how do you know whether you're successful or not? How do you measure that as a podcaster,
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:02.780]   author, mother, someone who is focused on their finances? What does success mean to
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:07.860]   you? I think that a really key part of what I
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:18.300]   have believed my success to be and is, is sustainability. I had to learn this, Sam. I
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:24.620]   felt like in my younger career, in my younger life, it was all about the wins. I want to
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:31.500]   accumulate success, a win here, a win there, do this, that, do that, and these one and
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:37.700]   dones and I wanted to collect all these trophies. But true success is when you do something
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:43.020]   and of course you love it and you feel aligned in this and it was like, "Okay, this is
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.980]   like I'm happy obviously," but that you can continue to do this for a long time.
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.260]   That it doesn't escape you. It doesn't, you don't get tired of it. It doesn't tire
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:00.660]   you out. And for me, like the podcast, it's been about nine years. What? I've been writing
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.900]   books for, this is my fourth book, 16 years. So I think the common thread there is that
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:11.580]   when you feel success, a huge part of that is knowing that this is the kind of success
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.660]   you can experience for a long time.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.100]   Your lifestyle.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:22.460]   It becomes, it starts to define you in like the best way. I still love the trophies. I
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:29.180]   still love like these little opportunities or these little public displays of success.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:33.920]   I used to think like as long as other people see me as successful, that's success, right?
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.340]   As long as my parents are proud or as long as I'm hitting these sort of, these wins
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:45.220]   that the public, like getting on television, having a TV show, been there, done that. But
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:51.820]   and those were successful moments, but the true successes for me are the ones that keep
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:57.100]   ricocheting and coming back and are sustainable. Because then I feel like this was meant for
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.060]   me. This is actually working for me.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:08.300]   Yeah, I like that because we know about One Hit Wonders in the music industry and great,
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:14.220]   great songs. And then I always wonder to myself, okay, you have the musical talent, the voice,
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.700]   the creativity. What happened? Why did you disappear? What happened?
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:23.380]   What happened? And everyone's got their own narrative. I think that at the end of the
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.980]   day, if you want to put one foot in front of the other and feel like life's working
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:33.940]   out, you have to commit to a narrative that works for you. I think it's very easy to look
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:38.100]   at maybe, let's go back to the singer who didn't get a record deal or didn't have
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:44.820]   more than one hit. That was still a cool thing that they did. And maybe the narrative there,
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.980]   I would, because otherwise I'd be like, "Oh, I'm not successful. I'm not as good
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:55.260]   as all these other artists." Guess what? You got to do the thing. You probably learned
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:01.260]   a lot and that will inform you in your next step in life. And there's no shame in that.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.660]   There should not be any regret in that. It should not make you feel less than. The good
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:11.900]   news is your life now has opened up for other successes and other things to pursue. When
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:18.220]   a TV show that I would do wouldn't get renewed, been there many times. I had talked about
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.100]   one hit wonders. For me, it's like one hit non-wonders. These were just shows that ... I
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.780]   mean, look, I was like, "Not everyone gets to do a TV show." So that in and of itself
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.900]   is spectacular. I'm going to focus on what's cool and unique about these opportunities
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:37.620]   and a lot of shows I would say to myself, it's a lot of conditioning. It's like furnish.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:43.100]   Some shows record and then they never air. So at least I got to air my shows. There's
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.420]   always like an at least, at least, at least. And when they wouldn't get renewed, of course
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:53.700]   it was crushing because you work so hard and it's just disappointing. But in my book I
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.300]   write about when my show Follow the Leader on CNBC did not get renewed, I realized that
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:06.980]   I gave it my best. And for some things to endure, a lot of stars have to align. I'm
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.620]   a star, but not all the stars came with me. You know what I mean? I showed up and did
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.900]   the work, but the network gave us a crummy time slot. They didn't really market the show.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:21.700]   The viewers were expecting more drama, which didn't feel authentic to what we were filming.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:28.180]   So they didn't get it. And so, okay, it's not made for television, but it was cool.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.140]   I still, you can't take those experiences away from me. And do you know what? When I
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:37.860]   got the call that they weren't renewing the show, I said, "All right, I'm going to pivot.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.240]   I'm going to find another success. I'm going to find something else to do that is more
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.540]   within my control that will feel like a win." And it was having our daughter. Because the
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:52.660]   truth is while filming a show, traveling, all that stress, there's no baby making during
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:41:00.180]   those weeks. There's no baby raising. I did not see my husband or my son for weeks at
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:05.780]   a time. And so I didn't feel like it was a responsible time to get pregnant again or
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.500]   attempt to get pregnant again. And so when that door closed, and I talk about this in
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:17.860]   my fear of endings chapter, when a door closes, that fear of maybe never experiencing that
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.420]   again is normal. But the opportunity that this fear wants you to identify is where is
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:30.900]   the next door? What is the door that maybe has been open, but you've been too afraid
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.780]   to walk through it? And I was afraid of trying to get pregnant, but then I was like, "You
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:41.700]   know what? No more. I'm going to do this." And our daughter was born the following year.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.100]   Why were you afraid of getting pregnant?
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:49.020]   Well, it was just because I didn't want to be pregnant on a set where I was expected
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:55.820]   to be flying around. And it shouldn't have maybe prevented me, but I wasn't getting the
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.700]   sense that this was the kind of production company that was going to work around my needs,
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.860]   let's just say. It's still a real ... I mean, I opened the book with "The World's a Scary
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:11.660]   Place," Sam. And I like to think that everybody is on my team and will cater to me. But no,
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:18.060]   the world doesn't revolve around me. I got to be looking out for myself. And I knew that
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:24.380]   my time would come to have another kid one day, God willing, but I just felt like it
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.220]   wasn't a responsible time to bring another kid in the world if this show were to continue.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.940]   And at the time, I was prioritizing that show above family. I'll be completely honest. I
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:38.980]   was ... well, not my current family, but the idea of growing my family. I wanted to see
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:44.500]   this through. Could I ... here's a little behind the scenes of television work. When
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.700]   you get the first season and you're a talent or you're a cast member, you have very little
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.340]   leverage. At least that's been my experience. And I think that's unfortunately more of a
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.980]   female experience to say, "I'm going to call the shots," or, "I want to get pregnant and
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:03.660]   everyone's going to have to film around me. You might get replaced." And so second season,
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:08.860]   you get renewed, different story, different story. You can get a bigger budget for things.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:14.140]   Suddenly you're getting wardrobe. Suddenly you're getting some more accommodations. Suddenly
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.380]   you're saying, "I'm pregnant," and everyone goes, "Okay, we're going to have to start
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:24.140]   moving things around and make sure she's comfortable." And so I was saying, "Okay, if we get renewed
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:29.500]   and once I know the schedule, maybe then I'll cross that bridge to see if I want to expand
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.020]   the family." Wow, we're really getting deep here. You just really opened a Pandora's box
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.360]   for me here. But that's ... those were all the things that were running through my mind
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:44.420]   at the time. But yeah, no regrets.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.060]   I think this is really important to be aware of because I asked that question, "Why would
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.540]   you fear getting pregnant?" And anybody who's gone through pregnancy knows that it can be
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:57.940]   a very up and down experience. It's not an easy experience. Giving birth itself is not
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:04.180]   an easy experience either. And for men, we don't think about it as much because we don't
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:08.900]   have to carry the child. We don't have to worry about our hormones changing, our bodies
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.900]   changing, our energy, having to go pee every 30 minutes, all that stuff. And so I think
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:20.220]   it's important for employers to recognize difficulties of familyhood and pregnancy and
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:27.380]   also how something like 20% of attempted pregnancies end in miscarriage. And this is also very
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:32.020]   important to be aware of. And so it's good to spread the word and spread the knowledge.
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.500]   Thank you, Sam. I talk about ... my first pregnancy was very difficult. I did have a
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:42.620]   miscarriage. I do talk about it in the book. It was gutting. And I think what I learned
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:47.820]   coming out of that experience, one of the things, I learned many things, is that you
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:55.620]   must, you must recognize your grief and you must be patient with yourself. Society wants
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:00.180]   us to move on. And first of all, at the time, nobody was really talking about miscarriages.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.020]   Now we do. So I didn't feel like I had a community and I felt really ashamed about it. I felt
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.380]   like I had done something wrong. I had done something wrong with my body. My body wasn't
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:16.340]   working. And I cried a lot. I was really sad. My mother and my best friends would say, "It
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.540]   wasn't meant to be." And all these things, they try to make you feel better. And it's
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:28.020]   like, "I'm just going through a phase. Can I just grieve?" And that was important for
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:34.780]   me. So now when I meet a woman or a couple who has gone through it or is going through
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:40.900]   it, there's really little I can offer other than just, "Please be patient with yourselves."
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:48.980]   And however it's happened, whenever the miscarriage occurs, every unborn child is important to
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:56.420]   remember and grieve. And I think we just don't give ourselves enough grace and there's just
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:03.540]   too much shame and, well, a misuse of fear around that where we think if we talk about
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:10.620]   it, there's the fear of, I don't know, triggering somebody or maybe being misunderstood or,
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:15.220]   "Here we go again. Someone's going to tell me something I don't want to hear." But do
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:22.820]   you. Do you. And try to the extent that you can not get sucked into all the noise around,
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:27.980]   you know, "Well, look, we live in a society that's obsessed with happiness." You know,
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:31.820]   raise your hand if you grew up and every time you cried or every time you got sad, someone
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:38.180]   said, "Don't cry. Don't be sad. What are you sad for? Why are you crying?" It's like, "Let's
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:43.420]   recognize the feelings, people. They're all valid." And that's really just what I'm saying
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.660]   is that if you're not feeling happy in the moment, it's okay.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:52.900]   I mean, everybody goes through something, folks. So, you know, I think, yeah, be patient.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:57.460]   Just be there for our friends and family. So important. One of the things I really love
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.740]   about your podcast is that you have a lot of different voices and that's something that
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:08.500]   I want to do is get many different voices on Financial Samurai podcast as well. What
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:14.740]   are some of the things that we can do more to uplift voices that aren't heard traditionally
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:23.420]   in the media or in books or whatever? It just seems like it's a tough world out there. How
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.700]   do we help others succeed as well?
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:32.820]   Well, as a journalist, I've become increasingly deliberate and this didn't just start a couple
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:39.100]   of years ago. It's been for majority of my career because I would see like all the people
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:44.620]   quoted in the media were largely all the same people over and over and over again. It's
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:50.420]   like, oh, this guy again or that man again, that John again. And then people would say,
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:54.300]   well, I mean, there just aren't as many women financial experts or there just aren't as
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.380]   many people of color financial experts. And I'm like, no, they're out there. There's a
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:06.900]   lot of them. And it takes like five minutes to do a little bit of searching to maybe find
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:12.780]   them because the SEO in Google is not working in their favor because all the other people
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:19.700]   are getting all the media and the press. So they do exist. I think that I'm always thrilled
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:24.620]   to meet somebody that has a unique perspective in personal finance and without hesitation,
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:30.940]   I'm like, please come on, so money. I think that there is no shortage of ideas that should
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.780]   be spread and perspectives that need to be shared. And I love it. It's one of my favorite
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:41.580]   parts of being a podcaster is bringing fresh voices to the forefront and learning from
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:47.540]   them. And it is my honor to do this. I don't think of it as my job anymore. I think of
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:53.980]   it as like my calling, my honor. Advice to everybody is just ask, ask. You don't know
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.220]   everybody of course, but ask around who's somebody that I should talk to, who's somebody
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:03.060]   that I should put out there, who's someone that I should help promote. They're out there
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.580]   and they may not be the best self advocates because, you know, again, the world's a scary
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:12.700]   place. So be their advocates and be their advocates when they're not in the room, whether
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.980]   you're at work or you're amongst friends, someone's asking like, who would be good for
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:23.300]   this or who would be, you know, I think it's important to talk up your peers, your friends
[00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:30.860]   who are maybe not like everybody else, women, women of color, LGBTQ, disabled Americans.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:37.300]   I think it's important that we remember that everybody is amazing. And just because maybe
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.500]   you haven't heard of them doesn't mean that they don't have something spectacular to offer.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.100]   In fact, it's just the opposite.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.340]   Yeah. No, thanks for that. I see both sides of everything. And it's interesting when I
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:52.860]   was doing my book and I was looking for the book blurbs, I intentionally try to look for
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:57.180]   different voices for the book blurbs. Because I look at the like a lot of the bestselling
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:03.580]   books, it's all the same people. It's very homogenous. So I think it's, yeah, if you
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:11.300]   want to help, be intentional to help people that you think are under heard, underrepresented.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:20.820]   Sam, what can we do to reconfigure some of these bestseller lists that seem to just love
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:26.660]   the same folks over and over again? You know, it's the same brand of people. I feel like
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:34.780]   publishing is so hard to break into. And once you even do that, then to get into this next
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:39.500]   breakthrough of being on a bestseller list, it's just, I feel like the odds are always
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.580]   stacked against anybody who's not named John.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:50.300]   Well, you know, just listeners, just I guess inside baseball, not really, is I think something
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:58.740]   like 84% of authors from the big five publishing houses are white. And so which leaves 16%
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:04.060]   for all other minorities. And minorities make up a bigger percentage than 16% of the American
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:11.620]   population. So the odds are stacked against folks of color. And also the industry is very
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:17.060]   white. And so you just have to keep on fighting. And you have to also just recognize those
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:23.140]   are the statistics. The one positive thing I think is that the percentages are changing
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:29.060]   to be more reflective of the US population and demographics. And if you actually can
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:34.940]   break through and be one of the, you know, 14 or 16% who get a book deal, for example,
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:41.620]   as a minority, then that's pretty impressive in itself, just for that fact. But there's
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.620]   a lot of progress to be made. And it's very competitive. So if you're at the top, and
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:51.380]   you've already got your network and everything, it's easier to keep on getting ahead. But
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.660]   you got to keep on fighting to try to break through.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:58.660]   Well said. Yeah, I'm hopeful. I think the industry is definitely, I mean, like I said
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:05.900]   earlier, it's been nine years since I published. And even just based on who's editing me in
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:11.900]   within the publishing industry, the publisher, like, and the people who are showing up on
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:17.020]   that team on the calls, I'm like, oh, my gosh, it's like the UN. The UN is here. You know,
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:22.140]   I love it. I love it. Yeah. And here's another thing for listeners
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:27.820]   to understand is that there are many, many qualified people of all different types. They
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:33.820]   just don't get that opportunity. And I'm just going to say, like, for example, let's say
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:39.420]   you're the CEO of some major corporation, and you get paid 50 to $100 million a year.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:44.060]   Yes, they probably do a great job, which is why they got there. But I will guarantee you
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:50.460]   that many other people can do just as great of a job, if not better, and make a similar
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.260]   amount or less. It's just being given the opportunity. And so one of the things that
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:59.260]   I like about you, Farnoosh, is that you've gone out there and created your own opportunity.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.860]   And I hope more listeners, if they see the gatekeeper, they can try to get through the
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:08.580]   gate. But if you can't, for some reason, try to make your own opportunities, because nobody
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.860]   is stopping you now, thanks to the internet and technology.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:18.460]   Yeah. You've got to go find your people. They're out there. It's a little bit more work, unfortunately.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:23.780]   We've got to make some extra steps. But that's what I love about fear, is that it is equitable.
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:29.460]   It is accessible to all of us. We all have this abundant natural resource pumping through
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:38.740]   our veins. Rather than see this as an excuse to not go do the thing, or freeze, or doubt
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:44.580]   yourself, take a minute and recognize, how did this fear show up? What is it trying to
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:51.580]   get me to protect? And how can I do that in a way that is safe and feels good to me? And
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:57.300]   every time I've asked fear these questions, my fears these questions, it has led to more
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:05.020]   thoughtful responses from me. And it's not always that maybe I get this massive win,
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:09.140]   but I do feel much better. I think that there is a world where you can be fearless, but
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:14.140]   until you get there, you have to respect your fears. You have to recognize them as valid
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:21.180]   emotions and just have a relationship with fear. We're so anti-fear in our culture that
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:26.620]   we don't think we can be fearful and courageous. I doubt, I disagree. I think you can be fearful
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:34.580]   and brave. I think you can be scared and smart. I think you can be both and. I think we owe
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.380]   it to ourselves to be more patient with our fears.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:43.660]   Yeah. Well, Farnoosh, this has been a great hour of discussion. We could talk for many,
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:48.180]   many more hours, but I've got to send the kids to school as well.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:51.340]   Oh, right, the kids. Oh, man.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:56.580]   But congratulations on your book, A Healthy State of Panic, coming out October 3rd, 2016.
