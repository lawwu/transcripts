[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   - One of the most common questions I've received
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.760]   over the years is on YouTube in particular,
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.520]   is how to stop intrusive voices.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.460]   And occasionally when people ask these questions,
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.460]   they'll highlight that some parent or an ex
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.800]   or something will kind of a judge voice in there.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.360]   And they don't know if it's their voice
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.240]   or the other person's voice, but it's in their head
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.900]   and it's very unpleasant.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.560]   Presumably this circles back to childhood traumas
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.560]   or other forms of traumas,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.960]   but irrespective of the origins,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.400]   are there any tools specifically
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.080]   to deal with intrusive thoughts and thought patterns,
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.200]   maybe even OCD like thought patterns?
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.840]   - So a couple of responses to that.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.860]   So first of all, I think step one is recognizing
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.800]   that if you are hearing another voice,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.360]   like if you can hear your dad's voice in your head,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.400]   it's not your dad who is in your head,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.760]   that is a simulation that you are engaging in
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.240]   that your brain is capable of producing.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.560]   And so that I think can be informative
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280]   for people who are curious about these inner worlds.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.680]   - I'm not referring to auditory hallucinations.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.620]   I'm referring to the language of somebody,
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.280]   maybe not in that person's voice,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.040]   but they're hearing like, maybe not you're a bad person,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.280]   but like you're never good.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.120]   You're not good enough.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.660]   Like it's not enough, or just feeling like,
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.880]   so they can't enjoy the good things in life
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.040]   because of these intrusive negative voices.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.280]   - Here's something that I hope listeners and viewers
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.100]   will find exceptionally liberating,
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.920]   as I have found liberating from just knowing the science.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.360]   So actually I talk about these intrusive thoughts in "Shift."
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.320]   They are incredibly normative.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.920]   And so there's research which looks at like,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.520]   how frequently have you experienced an intrusive thought
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760]   over the past week or a month or two months?
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.960]   The proportion of people who experience these dark thoughts
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.680]   is exceptionally high.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.580]   I don't remember the exact percentage,
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.400]   but it is in my book and it is like near ceiling.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.000]   I will do an exercise with my classes,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.480]   my undergraduate classes,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.080]   where I will ask them to anonymously describe
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.000]   whether they've experienced like a dark thought
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.100]   over the past week.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.200]   Almost all of them are capable of generating them.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.080]   And some of these thoughts are really, really dark.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.520]   I will often experience a very dark intrusive thought
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.560]   when I'm exercising at the gym.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.040]   You're looking at me with curiosity
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.200]   and a bit of concern right now.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.720]   - No, I'm not concerned, I'm just fascinated.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.520]   You know, I have ideas about why this may be,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.000]   but I'm just fascinated.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.160]   I don't know that I've had dark thoughts in the gym,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.520]   but it's interesting.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.440]   - Here's my dark thought.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.200]   Watch out if you see me in the gym from here on.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.460]   So if I'm carrying like a heavy dumbbell
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.720]   from a bench to a rack,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.800]   I will sometimes have a thought of dropping it
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.400]   on the face of another person on a mat.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.240]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.640]   - It's terribly dark.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.440]   It's a terrible, terrible thought.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.780]   So why am I experiencing that?
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.780]   It is most likely the brain's simulating worst case scenarios
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.160]   to prevent me from doing it.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.880]   Of course, I don't want to drop a dumbbell on someone
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.840]   I never have.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.600]   And so that's one explanation for why this is so normative.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.940]   It's your brain's way of constantly,
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080]   there's a theory that we're constantly simulating
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.520]   all sorts of possibilities for what could happen.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.020]   And most of these simulations,
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.840]   the probability of them coming to fruition
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.480]   are exceptionally low, infinitesimally small.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.200]   But on occasion, some of the wacky ones
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.400]   do escape into awareness.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.120]   And that's when we get the dark thought
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.640]   about harming someone or doing something illegal
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.520]   in a pretty aggressive, you know, egregious way,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.720]   or in my case, dropping the dumbbell on, you know,
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.040]   the person stretching on their face.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.980]   And so here's what I find liberating.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.980]   Me understanding that this is just how my brain works.
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.640]   Well, that doesn't mean now
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.160]   that I'm something wrong with me as a human being, right?
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.080]   That I'm morally corrupt in any way.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.480]   My brain's gonna sometimes produce
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.080]   these kinds of dark thoughts.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.680]   I'm not gonna act on them.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.080]   And as long as I'm not acting on them, it's all good.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.200]   It's almost like when people learn
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.440]   about the physiological response to anxiety,
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.720]   before they know what is happening,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.480]   that can often be an incredibly distressing experience.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.000]   Like all of a sudden your stomach is churning,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.160]   your palms are sweating.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.860]   But in research, which shows like if you,
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.000]   if you communicate to people,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.920]   "Hey, this is just your body preparing yourselves
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.800]   to adaptively respond to this uncertain circumstance
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.080]   you face."
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.720]   All of a sudden you are totally flipping the frame.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.000]   And now this is, I'm a Lamborghini, right?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.440]   I am rising to the occasion.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.760]   My body's doing what it should be doing
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.780]   to allow me to excel here.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.880]   That's the kind of flip that I think
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.240]   understanding the frequency and origins
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.320]   of intrusive thoughts can have for folks.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.320]   So step one is just recognizing
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.120]   if you experience intrusive thoughts at times,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.120]   again, welcome to the human condition.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.720]   It's a little blip in how our brain operates.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.360]   But a lot of these tools have also been shown to be useful
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200]   for nipping repetitive thinking in the bud.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.240]   So when you're curtailing chatter,
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.360]   you are also curtailing the likelihood of perseverating.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.040]   The reason why we often perseverate
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.880]   on problems we're experiencing is we are,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   we're highly motivated to make sense of these circumstances
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.600]   so we can move on with our lives.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.960]   And our brain, this wonderful problem-solving organ
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.840]   that we possess,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.360]   it just keeps churning until we've solved that problem.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.680]   And that's surfacing all sorts of related thoughts
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.520]   here and there until you get there.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.720]   And so when you solve the problem,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.280]   those thoughts tend to subside too.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.080]   - I have two points,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   both of which are essentially questions.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.400]   I think it's relatively common for people
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.240]   when they go to a bridge or a dam
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.000]   or something like something very high
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.480]   with the potential for essentially a fatal fall,
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.240]   were they to jump off, to have the thought,
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.040]   what keeps me from jumping off
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.400]   when in fact they absolutely don't want to jump off.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.480]   And it seems like it's another example of like,
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.920]   it's registering the danger
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.840]   and the severity of the consequences.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.160]   It also, I realize helps us understand the level of risk.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.000]   - That's right.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.600]   - You know, I think Alex Honnold,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.080]   who famously did "Free Solo" to El Cap,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.400]   a remarkable movie, by the way,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.480]   just along the lines of what we're talking about,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.440]   the way the movie is constructed,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.040]   and I think Jimmy Chin and colleagues who made that movie
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.480]   did such an incredible job,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.720]   not just with the cinematography,
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.400]   but you know he survives
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.760]   from the very beginning of the movie,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.960]   and yet it's terrifying to watch the whole thing.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.800]   And it's kind of a hour, 45 minute expedition
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.360]   of exactly what we're talking about.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.440]   In that movie, as I recall,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.800]   Alex spells out the assessment of risk and consequence,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.960]   right, you know, level of risk, level of consequence,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.800]   and how those are key parameters to evaluate.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.320]   And he's obviously done that for himself and he succeeded.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.640]   And I hope he never does it again,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.800]   only because he seems like a really delightful person
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.640]   when it'd be nice to keep him around.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.600]   And he's doing other important work now.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.880]   But the point being that I think it's a very natural thing
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.400]   to evaluate risk and consequence
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.240]   in a way that quote unquote feels dark,
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.400]   but it's actually highly adaptive
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.980]   through the lens that we're talking about it.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.480]   So that's one point.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.680]   - Well, just to that point, if I can interject.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.240]   So just to normalize this further for folks,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.240]   so my family is very special to me as it is to most people.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.480]   When my first daughter was born,
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.640]   we used to live in this house that had this,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.680]   on the second floor, there was a,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.560]   I don't know if you'd describe it as an overpass,
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.880]   but it was open to the floor beneath.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.080]   And I remember having these intrusive thoughts of at night
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.160]   when we'd have to bring my daughter into the bedroom
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.000]   to feed her or change her diaper, whatever,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.960]   I would have these thoughts of carrying her
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.160]   and then dropping her over into the, you know,
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.940]   and splat, like not pleasant thoughts to experience
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.320]   in the middle of the night.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.880]   It speaks to this point that you are raising
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.440]   that was likely my mind's way of homing in
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.280]   on a really, really important issue in my life
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.480]   that I wanna make sure never, ever, ever happens.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.520]   It is not an indication that I'm morally corrupt
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.800]   or incredibly dark person.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.480]   It's how my brain is operating, so.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.660]   - Yeah, you're assessing risk and consequence
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.180]   in an adaptive way.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.260]   Yeah, it's fascinating to think about.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.100]   The second comment slash question
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.060]   that I'd love your thoughts on is, you know,
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.320]   I had this bulldog, I talk about him all the time,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.780]   this bulldog Mastiff, and he had one default behavior
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.380]   that if he couldn't engage in it,
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.660]   would create anxiety in him.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.060]   And that was, he liked to chew, right?
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.020]   He liked to gnaw on things.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.260]   As a puppy, he actually would teeth on bricks
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.260]   in the backyard.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.620]   I was like, oh my goodness, it looks so painful to me.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.900]   And sometimes he'd bite through a lip.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.920]   You know, the bulldog part of their phenotype
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.200]   is that a lot of the pain receptors
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.320]   have been bred out of their face.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.040]   And so they, and I just think, oh my goodness,
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.180]   I go out there and I, you know, I was like distraught
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.720]   at how much pain he must be causing himself.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.200]   It was obviously less than I perceived.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.160]   But nonetheless, this gnawing behavior was what was,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.000]   you could just see it.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.820]   It gave him such pleasure, right?
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.660]   You give him something to chew on,
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.840]   and it just, you could just see the anxiety
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.620]   like dissolve out of him.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.520]   I've known a number of people
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.480]   that are fairly high intensity in terms of,
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.720]   they speak fast, high density of thought,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.040]   information, et cetera, at least outwardly,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.560]   who claim that they have got sort of a high RPM internally.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.000]   And I vary, and depending on time of day
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.320]   and time of year on this,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.600]   but I'd place myself more or less into that category.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.160]   Engaging in an activity that harnesses my full attention,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.120]   perhaps we could call it flow,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.640]   but nonetheless, engaging in an activity
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.500]   that harnesses my full attention,
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.380]   feels to me so unbelievably satisfying.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.580]   - Yeah.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.060]   - So unbelievably satisfying.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.180]   I think it's for two reasons.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.660]   One is the benefits of doing those activities,
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.740]   studying, learning, podcasting, doing research,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.580]   connecting with someone in a really directed way,
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.120]   like getting into that tunnel with them,
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.580]   as we're doing now, there's a positive feature.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.620]   And then there's also the removal of a negative,
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.420]   like that those RPM are not humming in the background.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.420]   And I think for a lot of people,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.420]   like ultra runners, and I know a lot of former addicts
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.460]   that start running marathons and get sober and stay sober.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.820]   - Yeah.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.340]   - It's remarkable how physical activity
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.800]   or cognitive activity can kind of take us
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.740]   into that plane of focus that both makes us productive,
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.820]   makes us fitter, but also relieves this inner voice.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.760]   It kind of like lets the tension out the same way
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.180]   that I observed Costello letting the tension out
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.380]   through gnawing on these bricks or rawhides
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.220]   or whatever it was.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.220]   And so my question is, is there, as I'm assuming,
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.460]   a relationship between the physical and the mental?
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.460]   Do we basically have a certain amount of energy in us
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.300]   and it varies between people and we need to harness
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.660]   and/or adjust that level of energy
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.220]   and to do that in ways that hopefully make us a living
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.260]   or bring our social relationships more closely together?
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.180]   - Well, it certainly plays out in physical context
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.700]   as you're describing, but it also, as you alluded to,
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.940]   plays out in cognitive contexts.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.140]   When there is this match, this sweet spot
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.140]   between the demands, like you're in a situation
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.780]   that is actually challenging,
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.400]   either physically or cognitively,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.440]   and the resources that you bring to that situation
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.500]   perfectly match the demands.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.020]   So it's a taxing situation,
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.500]   but you are able to engage with it completely.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.580]   That is the formula for getting, stuck is the wrong word,
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.700]   for getting immersed in these kinds of flow states,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.700]   which are, for many people, the goal that they have
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.580]   in their lives, both recreationally and professionally.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.300]   And so you, as someone who is ideally
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.940]   getting into these flow states with your guests,
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.220]   I would hope and imagine, and that's always the aspiration,
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.360]   that must feel really good.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.020]   I mean, you talk for a long time with people.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.240]   Does it feel like a long time
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.540]   when you're having those conversations?
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.740]   - No, time perception completely changes.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.380]   When I do this for two or three hours a week,
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.880]   and then when we do a solo episode,
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.980]   sometimes the recording's longest ever yet
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.540]   is 11 hours edited down.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.540]   But those can be anywhere from 90 minutes to four hours,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.580]   or a live event.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.760]   And I couldn't tell you.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.540]   It just seems like time just passes.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.700]   Time dissolves away.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.220]   - And when, that is because you are so absorbed in the moment
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.540]   and meeting the challenges of that situation
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.020]   that all of your attention is commanded
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.620]   to that point in time, that moment.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.720]   And that doesn't leave a whole lot of room
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.900]   for all of the chatter to percolate in the background.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.600]   (upbeat music)
