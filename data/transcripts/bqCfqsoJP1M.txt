[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - In the last podcast, Pastor John,
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.280]   you mentioned living now in the middle of nowhere
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.720]   in Tennessee, and this is the first time
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.840]   we've recorded and asked Pastor John
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.960]   from two different states.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   I'm in Minneapolis still, and you're in Tennessee
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.280]   for the next 14 months.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.440]   Give us a personal update on the recent move,
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.400]   and maybe give us an update on some projects
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.760]   you hope to work on in the next 14 months.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.840]   - Tony, we drove down to Tennessee
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.640]   with a 1/3 full Penske 16-foot truck.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.240]   I think I overestimated. (laughs)
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.600]   We didn't bring furniture, we just brought books
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.340]   and stuff we'd need for a year,
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.240]   'cause we were renting a furnished house
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.220]   from one of Noel's cousins.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.240]   And bless their heart, Marshall Siegel and Stephen Green
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.200]   drove the truck for us, and we drove our car.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.820]   And so we got here and moved into this place
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.800]   and are getting our, even as we record right now,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.640]   still getting our offices in order.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.920]   Talitha's gonna have a little place in her room
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.880]   'cause she's gonna do college courses online
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.480]   while we're here for this year.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.280]   Even though she's a senior in high school,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.800]   she's gonna be taking college courses
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.440]   that count for dual enrollment.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.640]   Noel's getting her little study set up
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.360]   in this master bedroom here so that she can work
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   on her biography of Esther Nelson,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.440]   who's a missionary nobody's ever written about.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.620]   And she hopes to get that basically done,
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.700]   I think, this year.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.400]   And for me, I hope to work on "Ask Pastor John."
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.720]   (laughs)
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.900]   - Well, thank you.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.200]   - So we've got a phone connection.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.720]   Actually, there's a few other things.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.540]   We're gonna be working on a new creative
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.020]   Bible teaching vision through Desiring God
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.180]   that we hope to roll out in a few months or so
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.520]   that we'll tell the people more about later.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.220]   And then there are at least three book projects
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.100]   and a fourth that I'm not decided on yet.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.000]   One is called "Five Points Toward a Deeper Experience
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   of Grace" to help believers know what has happened to them
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.160]   so that they can enjoy God more and love him
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.440]   and feel the sweet thankfulness that comes
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.740]   when you know what he really did for you
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.080]   and can help you then spill over
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.240]   in gospel telling for others.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.840]   So it's a book about Reformed soteriology
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.500]   at its most basic level.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.840]   And my desire is that people would see
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   that these things are for our joy and for our steadiness.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.240]   And they're not mainly about arguing or debating.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.800]   They're right at the heart of what gives us peace
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.980]   and sweet communion with the Lord
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.280]   because of the majesty of his salvation in our lives.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.800]   So that's number one.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.140]   Number two is called "A Godward Heart,
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.680]   Treasuring the God Who Loves You,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.960]   50 Meditations for Your Joy."
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.720]   It's a collection of 50 short readings.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   And the vision behind this is that we've published
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.080]   a "Godward Life I" and a "Godward Life II"
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   and let's see, "Pierced by the Word"
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.880]   and "Life as a Vapor."
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.200]   All those are collections of short readings
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.920]   that I've written over the years.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.440]   And our aim is to try to get that number up to 365
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.600]   so that we can then publish a series of volumes
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.560]   in which we have a reading for every day of the year.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.960]   So this is a step in that direction.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.760]   And then the third one is called,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.160]   it's a new Swans book,
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.480]   volume six in "The Swans Are Not Silent"
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.360]   called "Seeing Beauty and Saying Beautifully,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.640]   The Power of Poetic Effort"
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.880]   in the work of George Herbert,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.240]   George Whitefield and C.S. Lewis,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.680]   which is kind of a surprising combination, I think.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.240]   But I think George Whitefield is the surprising member,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.140]   I think, in that trilogy,
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.520]   because he was an evangelist and a preacher
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.760]   rather than a poet.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.280]   And yet when you see how he preached,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   there is a way that he had his own peculiar poetic effort,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.140]   and I'll try to define that,
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.400]   that I think gives a kind of unity
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.640]   to these three heroes of mine
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.440]   that I hope will be very helpful to people.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.160]   But here's the overall goal for this year away, Tony.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.320]   I do plan to move back to Minneapolis
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   sometime in summer of 2014.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.080]   And the reason for getting away is,
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.680]   number one, to make as much freedom for Jason Meyer,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.040]   my replacement in the pastoral role at Bethlehem,
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.000]   and for God to give me discernment
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.800]   for the next chapter of my life.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.520]   If God gives me 10 years,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.400]   that's how long my dad was really lucid.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.680]   I remember hearing my dad preach when he was 77,
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.280]   that's 10 years older than I am,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.400]   and it was a powerful sermon.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.560]   I've got a video of my dad preaching at 77.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.640]   I said, "Boy, if I could preach like that at 77,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.240]   "I would be so thankful."
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.240]   So if God, I mean, I think we should always plan for life,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.340]   but never presume pun life.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.140]   And so I'm gonna plan for it,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.440]   and the question is, what is the configuration
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.000]   of teaching at Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.320]   and producing audio and video and written content
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.800]   for desiring God, and speaking at conferences,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.680]   and ministering to missionaries, and encouraging pastors,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.660]   all those things that are possible now.
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.280]   Lord, show me.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.640]   So I would ask people as they listen to this,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.440]   just join me in prayer that this year
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.080]   would be a year of great illumination
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.840]   so that the last chapter could perhaps,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.520]   in God's mercy, be the most fruitful of all.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.220]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.640]   and thank you for listening to this podcast.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.360]   We do appreciate your prayers for Pastor John
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.920]   in this next year.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.840]   And if you have any questions,
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.720]   please email those to us at askpastorjohn@dc.org.

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.000]   Thanks for listening.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.160]   (upbeat music)
