[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Have you ever been sitting there at tax time, staring glumly at your business tax return,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.400]   looking at the number on that little line called "total tax due" and wondered if there
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.640]   were another way? After all, wouldn't it be cool if you could start a corporation that
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.200]   didn't owe any taxes? Ever? Well, there is such a corporation, and it's called a not-for-profit
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:14.920]   corporation. Interesting idea, huh?
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.600]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets. Today is Thursday,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:29.680]   February 5, 2015. Today we talk about not-for-profit corporations as compared to for-profit corporations.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.360]   Not a deep attorney-type conversation. We're going to stay big picture and general, but
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.820]   we're going to talk with a businessman who has operated within both environments and
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:51.920]   get his perspective. My guest today is a man named James O'Neill. James is a former police
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.680]   officer, former 911 dispatcher, and call to--what do they call him in that? Not the dispatcher,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280]   the person that takes the call. The dispatcher is the one who sends the people, but now is
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   involved with a company called Training for Safety. As you'll hear in the interview, they
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.600]   had a choice some years ago, and their choice was whether or not to organize as a not-for-profit
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.280]   corporation as compared to a for-profit corporation. This is a very interesting planning idea.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   I'm glad that James actually emailed me with the idea, and I'm glad that he approached
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.520]   me. It's something that was on my radar screen as a topic of further research, but I haven't
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.720]   made the time to research it yet. I was glad when James emailed and I said, "Hey, would
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   you just want to come on and talk about it?" I love that he came on as a businessperson
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.040]   from a business perspective to talk about the various benefits and disadvantages of
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.000]   a not-for-profit corporation. I hope you find this interesting. I hope you find it enlightening.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.120]   I hope you learn something, and I hope you can get some ideas that you can apply to your
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.160]   situation. Here's the interview. Enjoy. James, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.800]   Podcast. I appreciate you making time for me today.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   Joshua, thank you for inviting me.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.120]   As a listener, when you reached out to me and how we've come to do this interview today,
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.200]   you reached out to me, and among some other dialogue that we were having, you mentioned
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.840]   that you have experience and thought I should do a show on the topic of the not-for-profit
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.360]   entity as a potential planning idea. In our dialogue, I'm not an expert in this area,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   and you've had some personal experience. I thought the best way to handle this would
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   be to invite you on and we have a discussion about it together.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.080]   I'll just let you kick it off. What's been your experience and your path in the business
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.760]   world as pertains to for-profit entities and not-for-profit entities and your own personal
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.560]   experience with that?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.200]   A little bit about me. I was always the kid that had the side hustle going on. I didn't
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.360]   know what to call it back then, but always doing something to earn a buck, to sell something
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.480]   to my neighbors, to wash their cars or mow their lawns or what have you. That continued
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   on into my adulthood where I started a business, and it was always something that was on the
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.760]   side. It was always something that I could fall back on if my primary career, something
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.600]   to happen with that.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.780]   I found myself back in 2001 teaching for a living. I was teaching at a regional public
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.700]   safety training academy. That's where rookie police officers and firefighters and 911 dispatchers
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.580]   and medics come for their basic academy training. Then they come back periodically for in-service
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.360]   or advanced type of training.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.160]   I noticed that the standards of the education that we were providing were slipping. There
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.080]   were some issues and the executive director had this alleged open-door policy to come
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.040]   and talk to him any time there was something that you felt needed addressing. I went to
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.560]   him and he was not receptive to hearing anything about what I had to say and went so far as
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.960]   to invite me to go and apply somewhere else if I was unhappy, which was not really the
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.200]   point I was trying to get across.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.160]   I was thinking about that and muttering to myself a bit about it and was talking with
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.120]   a couple of the other instructors. Lo and behold, independent of what I was doing, they
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.360]   had done exactly the same thing and had gotten exactly the same reaction.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.560]   It turned out there were five of us who were a little bit disgruntled with what was going
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.760]   on. We all went out to lunch one day. The conversation turned to, "Well, we do this
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.880]   now for those people. We could do a better job and do it for ourselves." One of the members
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.400]   of this lunch group said, "If we are going to do it, we should definitely do a non-profit."
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   I knew nothing about non-profits, but I went to the only resource at the time that I knew
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.320]   of, which was Nolo Press. I called them and I said, "Do you have any books on non-profits?"
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.680]   They said, "We sure do." I gave them my credit card number and they sent me a very nice book
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.840]   that had a CD that went with it that walked me through the process of how to set up a
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.440]   non-profit. The five of us did just that. In 2002, we formed it. We've been running
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.680]   it. Some people have retired, but those of us that remain have been running it ever since.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.720]   We do mostly training for public safety officials on how to do their jobs better, how to do
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:51.200]   it smarter, and how to help people who are calling 911 on the worst day of their life.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.760]   What were the factors in that conversation that led to the person saying, "Oh, you should
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.360]   definitely do a non-profit"?
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.800]   He had been doing some research on an entirely different idea. He also was somebody that
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.320]   always had multiple irons in the fire. He was researching this for another perspective
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:21.400]   idea. But there were parts of it that appealed to him. Once I got into the book and started
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.000]   to learn and read, and then get out in the world and actually start providing a product
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.360]   as a non-profit, I realized that there are some substantial advantages to being a non-profit,
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:45.040]   especially in the educational role and especially in the non-traditional educational role. We're
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   familiar with colleges being not-for-profit entities, but private training providers are
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:59.200]   usually for-profit. As a non-profit, it gives us perhaps a little bit more legitimacy up
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.160]   front when people are first introduced to us. It gets us in the door of places that
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:12.440]   we would not normally get into. For example, since 2002, we've never paid for a training
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:20.120]   site. All those sites have either been given to us as a donation or given to us because
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:27.920]   it's in a public building, and they have meeting space for public entities and for non-profits.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:35.080]   There's probably the best example is the Kindler and Gentler Internal Revenue Service that
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:43.960]   you deal with. If you're a non-profit, the IRS assumes that you are doing good, and if
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.520]   you make a mistake, they assume it's an honest mistake, and they allow you the opportunity
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:56.040]   to correct it. There isn't the punitive aspects of the IRS in the non-profit world unless
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:05.120]   you're clearly running a criminal enterprise as a non-profit, but most aren't. I was very
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.360]   surprised when I turned in the original IRS form to apply for the non-profit that I got
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.400]   a letter back from an individual with his actual name and his email address and his
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.440]   direct phone number to call him if I had any questions or if I needed any help. That's
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.160]   not what I normally would expect from the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   The entity itself is registered as a not-for-profit corporation, but what about your personal
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.680]   income? Do you feel that you're making the same as simply an employee of the not-for-profit
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.200]   corporation as you would be as an owner of a for-profit corporation?
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.120]   Probably. Non-profits have employees just like for-profits do. Because we're not paying corporate
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.840]   income tax, there sometimes can be a little bit more money floating around a non-profit
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.440]   than a for-profit. And there's other income-generating opportunities in the non-profit world that
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:07.560]   you don't see in the for-profit world, grants and donations and volunteers that want to
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:19.000]   help. So if the non-profit is run as a business and the focus is on running a successful business,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.440]   the non-profit can be just as financially successful as a for-profit can. Look at the
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:37.040]   United Way. They have adequate financing, or so it would appear. But one of the challenges
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.480]   within the non-profit world is that sometimes the non-profit gets so focused on what its
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:50.520]   non-profit goal is, whether that is feeding the hungry or housing the homeless or finding
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.840]   lost puppies, that they forget that somebody needs to be in the back room doing the accounting
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.960]   and making payroll and paying the rent and keeping the lights on. And both of those have
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.880]   to be going on at the same time. If you're running an animal shelter, for example, you're
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.200]   going to have a lot of people that want to interact with the animals, but you're going
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.840]   to have many fewer people that want to sit in the back and keep the books balanced.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:28.240]   This is one of those areas where it almost feels like the ethics are quite tricky. And
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.280]   that's why it's an appropriately radical idea to bring on a radical personal finance podcast
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:41.240]   and talk through. Because this meme circulates in social media, it goes off and on, but you
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:50.000]   see this meme often that talk about how much the leaders of some large not-for-profit organizations
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.880]   make. And usually it's things like Goodwill Industries, the American Cancer Society, the
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:07.440]   American Red Cross. I looked up the Goodwill here in preparation for this. It says, "There's
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:13.360]   a lot of money." Where is it? Okay, so just pulling from a Huffington Post article here,
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:20.280]   the CEO of Goodwill Industries, Suncoast, makes $440,000 per year. The CEO of Goodwill
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.680]   Industries of South Florida makes $316,000, and there's a bunch of others of the local
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:31.440]   Goodwill organizations. The American Red Cross has a statement on its page that indicates
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:37.360]   that--and they were combating emails going around saying erroneous numbers, but the president
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.840]   and CEO of the American Red Cross is Gail McGovern, and her base salary has remained
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.960]   $500,000. And what's interesting is I actually--maybe later, I don't want to interrupt our interview
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.320]   with going down this rabbit trail, but I actually don't necessarily think that large compensation
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.120]   packages are out of line for not-for-profit organizations. I used to think that until
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.480]   I was exposed to some deeper thinking in it with the Chartered Advisor Philanthropy coursework
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.120]   that I completed, and it really challenged my thinking on it. So I don't particularly
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.440]   have a problem with it in the same way that many people seem to when it's shared on Facebook.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.320]   But the point of those numbers is as an executive at a not-for-profit organization, you can
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:30.440]   certainly earn a substantial salary, and you are, I assume, just simply responsible to
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:36.780]   your board of directors. So how do you work that out of setting up the board of directors
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:43.760]   for governance of the organization to figure out the executive pay and all of those issues?
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.880]   What has been your path through that?
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:53.960]   So when we originally were applying to be a non-profit and we were looking at who we
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:01.280]   were going to have on our board, we ran it through a very simple filter. If I'm sitting
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:09.560]   at a table with this board member, how can they help me versus how can they not help
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:21.220]   me? And amongst the original five of us that originally formed this company, we had people
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:26.400]   in our sphere of influence that, "Wow, if this person was sitting across the table from
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.960]   me, they would teach me a lot about advertising, marketing, technology, budgeting, whatever
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:39.520]   it is." And I was amazed when I approached these people and asked them if they would
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:48.080]   volunteer their time to be on our board, they all said yes, and they were all very complimented.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:55.420]   Part of it too is, when you talk about compensation, and let me be clear, I am not one of these
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.300]   highly compensated executives that you just rattled off.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.540]   Bummer. We'll get you there.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:06.580]   But yeah, I would like to have that problem. And I'm certainly not here to defend the Red
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:14.180]   Cross as an example, but if you look at the Red Cross not as a charity, but you look at
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.980]   it as an organization which is nationwide and maintains a fleet of vehicles in every
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:25.740]   community designed for disaster response and emergency preparedness and first aid and water
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:32.460]   safety and all the other things they do, what would you pay a CEO who was in charge of that
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:39.660]   organization if it was for profit, being that they have such a wide charter? And why is
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:47.040]   it not acceptable to pay someone in the non-profit world the same basic salary for the same set
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   of problems?
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:54.300]   Right. You make a valid point, and that was exactly what I was alluding to. I've heard
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.940]   many people when you're trying to say, "Well, how do I identify which not-for-profit to
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:05.660]   donate to?" And one of the metrics that, usually the first metric that most people go to is,
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:13.580]   "Well, look to see how much of the organization's income is going to program costs versus administrative
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:20.820]   costs." And administrative costs would generally include the salaries of the employees of the
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.620]   company. And so when you see these emails go around with allegations against the CEO
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.260]   of the American Red Cross, that's what they're focusing on. And most people say, "Well, they
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.980]   should be making $100,000 a year." But the point, and I originally saw it, it was a TED
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:41.020]   Talk by a man named Dan Pallotta. I'll link to it in the show notes and an accompanying
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:47.620]   article where he talked about the work and the size of an organization that a CEO of
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:55.060]   that capacity is running. And the point was, if you had those skills to run a massive,
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.780]   multinational corporation, does it make more sense for you to go, and if the equivalent
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.220]   salary that you could earn working in the for-profit world is $3 million, or $1 million,
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.780]   $2 million, somewhere in that millions of dollars, let's say $2 million for a nice round
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.740]   number, or for you to go and work for the American Red Cross and be paid a salary of
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:22.100]   $200,000, what makes more sense for you? Well, I gotta say, if I were making that decision,
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:28.340]   I would probably go with the $2 million and I would just give $300,000 to the American
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:34.700]   Red Cross if I cared about their cause, because that amount of money is gonna do more for
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.580]   the organization than the $200,000 that they're paying me, and I still am gonna have more
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.860]   spendable income in my pocket. And that argument really made me think. Now, many people in
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.060]   the not-for-profit, I wanna represent the other side, many people in the not-for-profit
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:55.380]   sector would strongly argue against Pallotta's argument. GuideStar and Charity Navigator,
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.100]   those organizations, that's why they publish the information, and I think there probably
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.860]   is a balance. But when I heard his argument, it was something I had never considered, and
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.340]   I had to sit back and say, "Wow, I don't think I'm ever gonna first go to somebody and say,
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:14.020]   'You need to look at CEO compensation,' or, 'And I'm not gonna share that meme on Facebook
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:21.020]   about how much the American Cancer Society CEO makes.'"
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:28.180]   So what you find in the non-profit world, I think more so than the for-profit corporate
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:34.580]   America, is people that truly believe that doing what they're doing makes a difference
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:44.660]   in their section of the non-profit world, or in their community, or what have you. Going
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:53.300]   back to the Red Cross example, your $300,000 donation, although I'm sure they would accept
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:19:01.900]   it, is not nearly as good as that team of a half-dozen people who are going to respond
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:10.060]   into a disaster area. So, although that team of people may be employees, they may be compensated,
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.740]   they may be compensated very well because they may be very educated and experienced
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:21.620]   individuals in dealing with whatever situation they're dealing with. They know, at some level,
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:27.740]   that they are making a difference. I can bring this back to the non-profit that I work for.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:35.860]   Our employees are people who have either retired from public safety, so they're getting a retirement
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.940]   income, therefore they don't need a whole lot of money from us, which, once again, they're
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:46.900]   giving back to the career that they were in, or they are people who are outside of public
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:52.820]   safety but who have dedicated a large chunk of their professional life to helping public
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:20:01.980]   safety respond better to emergencies and sometimes traumatic calls. I'm thinking about a couple
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:09.300]   of our instructors that teach classes in how to deal with the stress that come with certain
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:17.740]   incidents that public safety respond to, or the dealing with people who are just not quite
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:25.620]   right. You have somebody who has some sort of mental illness or somebody that has had
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:32.100]   post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury, and how to teach public safety to respond
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:38.780]   to that person and understand that they're probably not the threat to you that you originally
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:44.860]   think they are, and that here are some other ways that you can deal with this person that
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:51.180]   are going to have better outcomes. Normally, these people are doing this because they've
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:58.540]   seen their work has made a difference and has made a positive change in whatever community
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.820]   they're in. If you look at your local animal shelter, the people that are there volunteering
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:10.020]   and working for pay are doing it because they truly love animals and they want a better
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:20.660]   world for animals to be in. So, in the non-profit world, it's not all about the finances, and
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.340]   in my personal case, I'm one of these people that you've done a number of shows on that
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:30.620]   has sort of semi-retired and I'm financially independent at this point in my life, or at
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:38.420]   least mostly so. I do draw a small salary, but it's very, very small, and it's because
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:44.580]   I want to give back to the community.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:52.500]   What about the restrictions that come with a not-for-profit entity? Meaning, there are,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.180]   and I'm not an expert to know exactly what they are, but I have an impression that if
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.180]   I were to, so I could set up my business as a for-profit enterprise, or I could set it
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:09.020]   up as an educational mission, but I prefer to have full control over everything, and
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:15.820]   so I prefer to function as a for-profit. What about giving up the restrictions that you
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.060]   might have in a not-for-profit over certain things that you can do, certain things that
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.660]   you can't do?
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.820]   And there are some sizable restrictions on non-profits. Generally speaking, the non-profit
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:32.620]   has to have a recognized non-profit goal, and that goal has to be charitable or educational
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:38.060]   or religious or literary or scientific. Those are the big five. There's a few other outliers
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:45.260]   out there, but that's a little bit too much in the weeds. When you look at the Radical
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:53.100]   Personal Finance podcast, for example, clearly that's educational in nature. Now, where you're
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:23:03.360]   going to get a potential benefit being a non-profit is going to Comcast and saying, "This internet
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:10.400]   service that comes into Radical Personal Finance headquarters, that needs to be a donation
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:17.580]   because we're a non-profit." And when you are looking for a meeting room, then you go
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.580]   to the local library and say, "Here's our non-profit status. We'd very much like to
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:30.560]   use one of your meeting rooms." Those kinds of advantages and other advantages that exist
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:36.380]   within the non-profit world, there are non-profits that exist solely to provide liability insurance
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:42.400]   for other non-profits. It was never on my radar that there was a non-profit insurance
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:49.700]   company until I started a non-profit and tried to find insurance. And I was running a for-profit
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.440]   company and starting a non-profit at the same time, and I looked at the two insurance bills
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.360]   because they came in about the same time, and I thought, "My non-profit is actually
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:06.700]   doing things that are probably a little bit more risky in the liability area, yet I pay
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:16.200]   half as much for insurance." So there's that. There's also this idea that if you're a non-profit,
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.300]   you're just sort of by default trying to make the world a better place. And there's a little
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:30.400]   bit more acceptance sometimes, and that attitude of people is a little bit different. But there
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.920]   are some hurdles to get in. There's some paperwork that has to go to the IRS. I think it's a
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:46.080]   $400 filing fee, and you have to have one of these non-profit goals. But even then,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.040]   there's some wiggle room there. If you think about it, for example, there's a non-profit
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:58.560]   that's close geographically to where I am that runs an ice cream store. And you wouldn't
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.280]   think that running an ice cream store is a non-profit because it's not charitable and
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.240]   it's not educational and it's not religious and it's not literary and it's not scientific,
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:15.880]   except that the non-profit's mission is to teach inner-city youth how to run a business.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.560]   And they use the ice cream store as a training ground for these teenagers so that they get
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.800]   the experience so that as they get a little bit older, they can go out on their own, start
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:32.080]   their own businesses, and be successful people in the world.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.760]   I kind of have a love-hate relationship with the idea. And it's not that I don't see the
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.720]   place for it, but I guess I just don't like... I was talking about this with a friend of
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:50.400]   mine here in town. And he's a friend who's very interested in urban farming, basically
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.480]   of the Curtis Stone variety. And so he's working to set things up. And he was corresponding
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.840]   with Curtis Stone after hearing him on my podcast to try to bring him to town, to West
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.960]   Palm Beach where we lived, to build a, to do some seminars locally so we can try to
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:14.440]   get our local food movement going here in West Palm Beach. And I'm not ready to allocate
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.360]   the limited time I have towards major help, but I was trying to help out a little bit
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:24.460]   where I could. And he was saying how difficult of a time he was having finding a meeting
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:31.040]   room, exactly what you said. And because he doesn't have a non-profit entity and he was
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.480]   thinking about, "I might just have to start a not-for-profit educational entity just simply
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.800]   to be able to negotiate the local environment to find a meeting room at a reasonable price."
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:46.960]   And my issue with not-for-profits, I guess, is I have this idea that capitalism has done
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.360]   a major amount of good in the world and I don't like asking people for money for donations.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.760]   And I don't, I think that things should stand on their own. But it's kind of a real problem
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.440]   for me because I have this idealistic perspective of not wanting to ask people for money, for
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.680]   donations. I think that's not so good. But yet I like to donate money and I like to give
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.080]   money. And I see the work that some things do, but then I think, "Why doesn't somebody
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.480]   just do this and solve it in a better way?" And so I have this real conflict of emotion
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.200]   surrounding the ethics of it and what I want to be involved in and what I don't want to
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.280]   be involved in. I talk myself in circles over it.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:33.000]   So that's a common misconception of the non-profit world is that we are donation driven. There
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.720]   are many, many non-profits, including the one I'm with, that we get less than 1% of
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:46.440]   our funding from donation sources. So we're in the business of doing training classes
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:53.440]   and we do 50 to 60 training classes a year. We've been doing this since 2002. We have
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:00.480]   never paid for a meeting space. They've always been a type of donation or a public building.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:09.520]   But the idea that a non-profit can't charge for its services is not correct.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:18.400]   When a student wants to come to our class, their agency pays for it. And we make a sufficient
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:26.720]   amount of money from the agencies that are fiscally sound that we then turn around and
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   donate about one-fifth of the student seats to agencies that perhaps need to come to the
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.540]   training but can't afford it or have some sort of budgetary restriction in the year.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:47.680]   So we're kind of taking the non-profit donation model, kind of turning it on its head, in
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   that we're donating back based on what people that can kind of afford to pay do. And that's
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   hundreds of thousands of dollars of savings every year to local government entities that
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.800]   just don't have the budget that some of the other agencies do.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.200]   So a question on that, and I'm glad you corrected that because I didn't mean to give that impression.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:19.280]   I'll tell you, one of the best classes I took was recently, a couple years ago when I went
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   through those philanthropy courses. And at the table was a number of leaders and executive
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.840]   directors of not-for-profit corporations. And man, I learned so much about a world that
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:35.160]   I had little experience in. And one of the things was how each organization is very unique.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.600]   Some are almost entirely donation-driven and some like yours are not. So I thank you for
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.960]   correcting me.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   My follow-up question though, if that, I guess if the impression of the things like meeting
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.000]   space, that's valuable. But if it weren't for that, if it weren't for the positive impression,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   is there anything that you couldn't do just as well in a for-profit corporation? Or is
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.840]   the fact that the advantage of the not-for-profit due to the business and social climate that
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.800]   we live in?
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.720]   So we have a competitor in my area that does pretty much exactly the same thing we do,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   and they're a for-profit business. And they are more expensive. And I assume that they
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.120]   are, I've never had access to their books, but I assume they're more expensive because
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   they're paying tax on income. And I assume that they're also paying for other things,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:42.920]   other expenses that we don't have to pay for. Clearly we could do exactly the same thing
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   as a for-profit company, and I think it would be okay. I think we could still have that
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   same attitude that we're giving back and that we're trying to make the world a better place,
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:05.600]   at least our little tiny sliver of it. But being a non-profit just seems to open doors
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:13.680]   a little bit easier. And sometimes, too, a non-profit, if you're open to thinking outside
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   the box, being a non-profit allows you to do some things that perhaps for-profit entities
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.680]   couldn't do.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   Let me give you an example. I was in a police station the day before a training class, and
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.520]   I was checking out the classroom, and I was getting the tour from one of the people that
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.080]   worked there. And they had just built this new police station. They were very proud of
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   it. It was a beautiful building, and we were walking around. And in this one corner, there
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.240]   was a very large bank of batteries that provide backup power to the police station if the
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.780]   utility power should fail. And there was a gentleman there, and he was taking batteries
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:04.880]   and switching them around and replacing some old batteries. So I got to talking with him,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.960]   and I said, "Why are you doing this in a brand new building?" And he said, "Well, we actually,
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.080]   to save a little money, we took some of these batteries from the old building, and we're
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.800]   trying to make them work, but they really need to be replaced. And I'm going to have
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.880]   to pay X number of dollars to get these disposed of properly and put the new batteries in place."
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:29.080]   And I said, "Well, why? What's exactly wrong with the old batteries?" And he said, "Well,
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   they're technically nothing, but we tend to cycle them after three years just to make
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.680]   sure that there's no possibility that they could go bad because they power the backup
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   power for the 911 center, and you don't want that to stop working." So I got him to donate
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:52.840]   the batteries to us, and then took them to a local ham radio flea market and sold them
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   to ham radio operators who wanted backup batteries for their ham radio systems. He got a donation.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.880]   He didn't need to pay to have them disposed of. There were a whole bunch of happy ham
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.920]   radio operators that got a very good battery that's going to be given extra tender loving
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:17.040]   care by them, and they got it at 10 cents on the dollar because it was used, and it
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:23.720]   was all profit for our non-profit. I don't know if I could have done that within a for-profit
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:29.680]   business and made it as attractive as it was for everybody concerned.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   So what about the idea, for example, let's use radical personal finance as an example.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:40.480]   One of the things I've thought about is I would love if I could free up time or perhaps
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   develop a curriculum or something. I'd love to teach more in my local community, and I'd
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:56.040]   love to just help people with financial education. I haven't figured out how to do it. I've got
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:01.280]   the same 168 hours in a week that we all do, and I'm pretty stretched right now, but I
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:07.400]   just look around and I figure out and I try to think, "How could I cross the electronic
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   divide?" And so I could very well set up a teaching not-for-profit entity focused on
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.560]   financial education, and I could develop a curriculum. I could bring in volunteers. There
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:26.160]   are some organizations that do something like that around here, but whether we went into
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.120]   schools and taught to students, I would love to do that, or whether we just worked in the
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.200]   local community and teaching people who don't often have access to education until we get
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:42.280]   their podcast link set up so they can download my show for free. So something like that.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.240]   I could set up a not-for-profit entity, and then I could run it alongside my for-profit
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.920]   corporation where I'm selling educational materials, I'm selling show content, things
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:59.440]   like that. As a more experienced business person, could you see that being a good way
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.280]   to navigate the advantages and disadvantages of each entity?
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:09.720]   Possibly. Within the nonprofit community, there are nonprofits who are dedicated to
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   helping other nonprofits become better businesses. I was on a webinar just earlier this week
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   actually for a nonprofit foundation that wants to create online training content for
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:34.840]   as many, essentially as many nonprofits as they possibly can. And they are offering the
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:42.280]   entire online platform for free to nonprofits as a grant. And then also, I think, there
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   is a technical expertise and their employees on the for-profit side of their business
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:36:00.720]   to help with the nonprofits. In terms of radical personal finance, that kind of thing would
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:07.840]   be a fit, perhaps, because all of the infrastructure is already figured out by someone else, and
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.600]   you get the benefit of a staff without having to pay for a staff, because when you're finished
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   with them, they go back to their normal day job of doing this at the for-profit company.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:25.200]   And in reality, if you had these training products that you were going to try to sell
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.920]   on the for-profit side of the business, I don't know why you would do that. I don't
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.880]   know why you would simply just not sell them on the nonprofit side of the business. I don't
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:40.880]   see a reason why you would need to decouple those two things. Because selling educational
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.720]   material is one of the things that an educational nonprofit does, because they still have to
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   keep lights on and they still have bills to pay and salaries.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:57.560]   I guess, I'm glad I got you on here. I have some friends that are attorneys and they're
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:03.680]   specialists in the not-for-profit space. But the problem is, they immediately go so deep.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   It's hard to get an attorney to describe something from just a simple business perspective. But,
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:18.160]   I'm glad that you look at it from your perspective. I guess my issue is simply the negative opinion
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.200]   that I have of, in general, most people I think have a positive opinion of not-for-profit
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.560]   entities. I hold, and this will probably mellow out with more time and more experience, but
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:34.560]   I hold the opposite. I guess I see so many of the large foundations, the family foundations.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:40.440]   When you go and you study the tax structure of something like the Rockefeller Foundation
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.260]   or the Carnegie Foundation, things like that, and I look at it and say, "How would I dispose
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:52.260]   of $10 billion?" Well, I certainly don't want to keep it out here in the taxable world.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.400]   So if I'm going to keep it out here in the taxable world, then it's going to be subject
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.420]   to tax year by year. All I'll do is I'll go ahead and charter my foundation. That allows
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:09.420]   me to keep my money exercising control over other people and over society with influence
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:14.140]   without it being taxed. I always struggle. I know that's a little bit weird for people
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.860]   who haven't thought about it, but I struggle with it because it doesn't seem like a level
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:23.860]   playing field. Personally, I don't like the state having the ability to dictate what it
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:31.220]   does, who's agenda is promoted and who's not. I don't like the tax deduction for charitable
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.980]   donations. I prefer to do it myself. Again, this is weird for someone who's obsessed with
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:42.620]   tax deductions, but I don't want anyone to know about my charity, including it being
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.860]   listed on my return. I don't want the tax deduction for it. It's one of those things
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:53.640]   where you've got to measure the cost of that and see if you're willing, but I just assume
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.780]   that those things are private. That really trips me up, personally, because of that weird
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:04.300]   philosophy. That trips me up to be able to look at the question objectively.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:11.300]   Within the foundation world, clearly the large foundations are trying to influence areas
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:19.900]   of interest that they have. The very wealthy that give lots of money create their own foundations
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:26.900]   and they typically center it around an idea that they want to see the world
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:33.900]   better in providing technology or healthcare or whatever their interest lies in. There
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   are other foundations, however, that are extremely broad. They're looking for a good idea and
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:51.900]   if you have the good idea, they're willing to fund it if they also think it's a good
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:58.900]   idea. But a lot of non-profits out there get zero dollars from foundations and get very
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   little from donations. They are simply running a business that has a separate entry in the
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:12.900]   tax code. To a certain extent, I think it's foolish not to take a tax deduction and to
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.900]   not take a tax deduction if you're entitled to it. Therefore, is it not equally foolish
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:25.900]   not to form a non-profit if you're eligible to do so? As opposed to a for-profit corporation.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:35.900]   Right. By the way, the reason why I struggle with that is actually, for me, a biblical
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.900]   perspective. The Bible says, "When you give, don't let your left hand know what your right
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:47.900]   hand is doing." I'd prefer that nobody ever know anything about what I'm doing with charity.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:54.900]   That would be my personal preference. I would prefer that nobody know. That's a very different
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:59.900]   thing. By the way, this is one of those areas where I, as a financial planner, it would
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.900]   be professional malpractice, I think, for me to give that kind of advice to somebody
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:10.900]   because charitable planning is a major piece of tax planning. That's the reason why I have
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:20.900]   that weird thing about, "I don't like being on record." I don't like how in a presidential
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.900]   campaign, then immediately, "Okay, we've got to publicize the tax returns. Let's see how
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:31.900]   much money this person gave." It's my personal liberty-minded orientation that causes me
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.900]   that issue. As with many things in my life, my politics often cause me trouble.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:41.900]   Well, and there's a little bit more in the non-profit world regarding privacy because
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:48.900]   every non-profit- we don't file an income tax return because we don't pay income tax,
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.900]   but we file an informational tax return with the Internal Revenue Service every year, and
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.900]   sometimes to state returns, depending on what state you're in. The IRS turns around, takes
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:07.900]   that informational tax return, and puts it up or allows it to be put up on the Internet
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:16.900]   for anybody to read. So if you are mentioned in that return, if your name is on the board
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:22.900]   of directors or you're drawing a salary over a certain amount, your name is on that
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:28.900]   informational return and exactly how much you got. So the other side of it, not only
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.900]   the donation side of it, but also what the non-profit- how the non-profit pays its bills
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:38.900]   are very, very, very open to anybody that wants to look. All you have to do is go to
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:47.900]   GuideStar and put in the name of the non-profit and it will pop up. So if privacy is a concern
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:53.900]   from the standpoint of running the business, then that would be a negative to starting
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:59.900]   a non-profit because you can shield some of that information in the for-profit corporate
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.900]   world. There is no shielding that information in the non-profit corporate world.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.900]   The other development that I see, and I think this is especially important as my generation,
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:17.900]   kind of the millennials come, come into the workforce and advance in their careers. I
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   don't know anybody from my generation that only thinks in terms of dollar profit. Most
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:28.900]   people in my generation, and I don't know why there's various people that talk about
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:35.900]   the influences, but I'm concerned partly with dollars but also with impact. And that's
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   changing the business world and that has led, I think, to the development of the B Corporation
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.900]   or Benefits Corporation. And slowly there's this new- and it's on my research list. I'm
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   totally ignorant as far as the details of it. It's some of the things I need to learn
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.900]   more about. But you see this kind of fusing coming together with the B Corporation. It's
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.900]   just the legislation in Florida where I live was just approved last year. And it's essentially
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:06.900]   this merging of and blurring of the lines between for-profit entities and not-for-profit
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:13.900]   entities. So you certainly see the, even just the legislation is showing the tension between
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.900]   these two approaches.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:21.900]   Just go to the internet, type in the name of a Fortune 500 company, and instead of putting
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:29.900]   .com at the end, put .org, which is the suffix for non-profit world. And you'll find that
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:37.900]   many of these companies have a charitable arm or a grant arm or they're providing a
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:43.900]   similar service that they do on the for-profit world to the non-profit world. And there's
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   a great deal of that mixing. I'll use Google as an example. Google is very generous in
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:45:01.900]   the non-profit world, giving non-profits for free what they sell to the for-profit companies.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:13.900]   So in terms of emails, email addresses, in terms of Google Docs and Google Drive, in
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:21.900]   terms of AdSense and various analytical tracking that they do and that they charge a lot of
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   money for in a lot of places, they will give that to the non-profit world for free. Mostly,
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.900]   I assume, because they make that assumption that the non-profits are out there doing some
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.900]   good and that they want to support them.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:45.900]   So question, as we start to wrap up our conversation here. You have run and been involved in both
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.900]   for-profit corporations and not-for-profit corporations, correct?
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.900]   Correct.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.900]   If I took away corporate income taxes and personal income taxes...
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.900]   Can you do that?
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:03.900]   I'm trying. Unfortunately, I'm in about 1% of people. It's like every economist from
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:09.900]   every major school would say, "Eliminate income taxes." But in the general population, I'm
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:16.900]   in the tiny, tiny minority. But let's assume that I... This is what I would vote for. Eliminate
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.900]   tax influence. Eliminate the income tax, both the corporate income tax and the personal
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:29.900]   income tax. Just completely eliminate it. Do you have a sense of would you still choose...
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.900]   I mean, it's such a hard world to imagine, but would you still look at one entity type
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.900]   versus another if I were to completely eliminate income taxes?
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:45.900]   I'm not sure I can really imagine that kind of a world because the tax structure in this
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:54.900]   country is so intertwined into everything we do every day. If you eliminated all income
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   tax, both corporate and personal, I'm not sure the non-profit world would need to exist
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:06.900]   because every corporation essentially could be a non-profit, if that makes sense.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.900]   Exactly.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:12.900]   So apparently we need to get you a magic wand so that you can make this happen.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:19.900]   Well, there is this tiny minority of libertarians who do it. And if anyone's interested, it's
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   not... Even though it sounds a little bit nuts to most people, it's really not that
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.900]   far-fetched. And there are very few things that if you enjoy studying economics, there
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:35.900]   are very few things that a majority of economists from various schools and philosophies agree
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:42.900]   on. But there's very little disagreement over the idea of removing corporate income
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:47.900]   tax. That is one that many people would agree on. There's more controversy over the idea
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:53.900]   of eliminating personal income tax, although I'm on the weird fringe where that would be
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:58.900]   my proposition, is eliminate income tax. It just does not make sense to me because then
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.900]   it forces... If you eliminated income taxes, it would free up people like me to do more
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:11.900]   useful work than simply helping rich people avoid tax. And that's how I see it. It's fairly
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:18.900]   simple. It allows people to focus on enterprise and just simply their ability to focus on
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.900]   what they're actually trying to do. And again, that's a very complicated discussion to go
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:28.900]   to actual numbers and look through.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.900]   And you have an incredibly large ingrained industry that would not like that idea.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:38.900]   No, but that's the problem is it'll never happen. Because even, for example, I'm for
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.900]   the... Personally, it's my personal political opinion. I'm for the elimination of every
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.900]   single tax credit and deduction. So I'm for the elimination of mortgage interest deduction.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   And that's the one that gets everyone upset. Well, it'll never happen. I don't see any
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   possible way where it will happen barring some dramatic change in the political environment
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.900]   we live in simply because you say, "Well, we're going to get rid of the mortgage interest
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.900]   tax credit." Well, all of a sudden now the National Association of Realtors flips out.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:09.900]   Or if we're going to get rid of clean energy tax credits. Well, all of a sudden now these
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:15.900]   people flip out. And I just simply don't think it's a good practice for the state to dictate
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:21.900]   policy through the tax code. And that's what happens is certain organizations get funded
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.900]   and certain ones don't. And it's all a matter of manipulation. And so if you're going to
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:31.900]   go and... It's incentives. And the incentives work. That's the thing is we all align ourselves
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.900]   with the incentives. And I don't particularly like that way of running a society. I would
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.900]   prefer each individual person to simply be allowed to make the decisions for how they
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:48.900]   run their life and without having to deal with going counter to the incentives that
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:52.900]   are established.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:58.900]   Feel free to comment if you... I'm sorry. We got into a political discussion there.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:05.900]   I'm not sure what to say other than when you make that happen, please send me an email.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.900]   I would like to come and visit and perhaps move.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:14.900]   I live in this very strange world of idealism in my head. But that's all right. It doesn't
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:18.900]   bother me very much. We'll see. You never know.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.900]   Maybe you would be happier with tax policy if some of our elected officials were just
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.900]   a tad bit smarter.
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:31.900]   I would probably be that way. But unfortunately, I don't see much barring... We'll see. Again,
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.900]   the only change happens is political change only happens when the pressure gets great
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.900]   enough. For example, as we record this, it's the 5th of February. And if you watch what's
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:45.900]   happening in Greece and in the Eurozone and the Greek government, if you look at the political
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.900]   pressure that's been exerted on the Greek government by people saying, "This is ridiculous.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:53.900]   Why are we going to mortgage our futures to pay this debt?" It'll be interesting to see
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.900]   what Greece does.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:00.900]   And my personal prediction, please don't do anything with this, but ultimately, I think
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.900]   they'll just say, "We're not paying the debt," and they'll default.
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.900]   And what's interesting is when the pain gets great enough, the government responds. But
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:14.900]   unfortunately, it usually happens when the pain is great enough. And so, I don't see
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:21.900]   any possible way for my ideal little slice of the world to exist. But you can at least
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:27.900]   sit and think about it and see how it would be more advantageous, which is generally what
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.900]   I do.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.900]   As we go, I'd like you... We have an outline here in our notes of the pros and cons. Would
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:43.900]   you take a moment and just reiterate the notes from your outline as a good concluding summary
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:47.900]   and then give people some suggestions on where they can go for more information?
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:56.900]   Sure. If you're an individual that is thinking about starting a business, especially a corporation
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:03.900]   and not just a sole proprietorship business, but you want that legal structure, you want
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:11.900]   that perhaps personal protection that a corporation offers, a nonprofit is something to consider
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:18.900]   if it is within that charitable, educational, religious, literary, or scientific purpose.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:24.900]   It has worked well for us. I know that we're only one data point. I would encourage people
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:33.900]   to look to the nonprofit community locally. Go to an event where they are doing a training
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:40.900]   class or a mixer or what have you. Look around. See if it's the kind of industry that you
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:48.900]   would be comfortable in. Don't get caught into the idea that you have to always be soliciting
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   for donations. You can absolutely charge for services just like any company does. If you're
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:53:01.900]   the kind of person that writes well and perhaps has had some grant writing experience, the
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:09.900]   nonprofit world can be very lucrative. There are some cost savings in the nonprofit world
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:16.900]   in terms of... I gave the insurance example earlier. Many municipalities, the business
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:22.900]   license is free for a nonprofit because they assume we don't have any money. Rarely do
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:29.900]   we pay full price for anything. Almost every business, large business, has a nonprofit
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:35.900]   discount. That includes when I go down to my local office supply store to buy a ream
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:42.900]   of paper, there is a nonprofit discount because I took the time to register as a nonprofit.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:50.900]   And you see that across the entire industry. When you're a nonprofit, you are a real business.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:56.900]   People can go look you up, see what you do, find out about you, independent of what you
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.900]   might put on your website. That may be a big advantage to somebody depending on the type
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:08.900]   of business that they're running. It's also a good venue for volunteers. If you see that
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:13.900]   something that would be good for whatever you're thinking of doing, volunteers like
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:22.900]   to come to nonprofits to come to work. And some volunteers put in a remarkably large
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:27.900]   amount of hours. You'll find that sometimes people will come in, volunteer full time,
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:32.900]   and become full-time employees for you. But there are some clear disadvantages to nonprofits.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:40.900]   You might not have a nonprofit goal that's compatible. You may not have the time or the
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:45.900]   you may not want to deal with the amount of paperwork and dealing with the IRS and filling
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:54.900]   out the forms and reading the book and following the sometimes detailed step-by-step instructions.
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:59.900]   There's definitely a delay. Paperwork takes time. It takes time for the IRS to process
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:07.900]   it and get back to you. That's going to be weeks, probably months. But if time is not
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:13.900]   a constraint, then that might be okay for you. There's definitely shared control. You
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:19.900]   have a board of directors. Now, that board of directors might be three people. And you
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:25.900]   might be one of those people on the board. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:30.900]   definitely something you have to think about. Can these people contribute meaningfully?
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:35.900]   Can they give you ideas? Can they give you guidance? Can they introduce you to people
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:41.900]   that you normally would not be introduced to? I frequently do this with my board. I
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:47.900]   ask them if they know someone in a certain industry or job. Frequently they do. They're
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:53.900]   happy to make the introduction. And it's a different kind of introduction when they're
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:58.900]   saying, "I am on the board of directors. This person works at this company. Please
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.900]   talk to him." It's a very different experience than, "Hey, I've got a friend and he
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:10.900]   wants an hour of your time to talk." The book we used is from Nolo Press. The title
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.900]   of it is "How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation." It's written by a nonprofit attorney
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:21.900]   named Anthony Mancuso. I've never met the man, but he wrote a really good book with
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:28.900]   lots of step-by-step instructions. Clear, concise, fill out the forms, do what the
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:33.900]   man says in the book, and the rest is history, as they say. Or, of course, you can
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.900]   just put advantages of a nonprofit into your favorite search engine, and you will
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:46.900]   get a lot of hits from a lot of large nonprofit entities that exist to help
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:52.900]   nonprofits. But you do have to have the idea. You do have to have the desire to do
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:59.900]   something positive. Making money is probably a secondary thing in the nonprofit
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:07.900]   world, but it definitely needs to be a thing. But if you find you're passionate
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:13.900]   about something, maybe the nonprofit road is the road you might want to take.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:18.900]   >> I'll reaffirm your recommendation of Nolo Press, both there with the specific
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.900]   book you recommended, and also in general. They're actually one of the few
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.900]   companies that I've thought about that I could wholeheartedly endorse and
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:30.900]   advertise for on this show. I haven't gone and approached them to see if they
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:34.900]   want to sponsor the show. But for the large contingent of DIYers that are in the
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.900]   audience, I have never been dissatisfied with a Nolo Press book that I've looked
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.900]   at. Obviously, some are limited in scope, some are broader in scope, and you need
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:47.900]   to choose the book that is going to serve your needs. But they do a very excellent
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.900]   job with all of their books. And as far as I've been able to find, they've been
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:56.900]   accurate, they've been well-written, and I just love what they do. So check out
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:01.900]   How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation, or check out any of their other titles if
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:07.900]   you are looking for information on various aspects of financial planning. And
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:12.900]   check at your library. My local library has a large number of their books in
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:17.900]   stock. Let me amplify that for just a minute. When we went through this book,
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:23.900]   and there was an accompanying CD that had all the forms on it to fill out, we
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:27.900]   went literally step-by-step through this. I had no knowledge of the nonprofit
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.900]   world prior to this. And then I sent this package off to the Internal Revenue
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:38.900]   Service, and it was obvious that someone at the IRS read through this line-by-line
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:44.900]   because we got a letter back asking a couple of very specific questions about
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   something that we had put on this form. So it was very obvious that a human being
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:55.900]   sat down with this and studied it. And once we answered those questions, our
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:01.900]   nonprofit certification came in the mail. So if it's good enough for the IRS,
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.900]   it's probably good enough for the rest of us.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:09.900]   Absolutely. James, thank you for A) coming on, B) listening to the show, and
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.900]   C) suggesting the topic. I really appreciate it. I've enjoyed our conversation.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:14.900]   Josh, it was my pleasure.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:22.900]   Now obviously your proper step from here is research. Because again, there are
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:28.900]   many factors that go into any entity selection decision. There's many factors
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:32.900]   that go into choosing between a C corporation and an S corporation. LLC
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:37.900]   versus partnership versus proprietorship, and for-profit versus not-for-profit.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.900]   Even as I mentioned there at the end, what about that B corporation? It's legal
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:46.900]   in 28 states. Frankly, I don't have a clue about it other than just a brief
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:51.900]   nagging of my mind saying, "Joshua, you need to go and research that." So that
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:55.900]   is something that is on my list that I need to do and prepare some information
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:59.900]   because frankly, I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to that. So
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.900]   do your research. But I do think that for some of you, this could be an
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.900]   interesting idea that you could apply in your situation. So consider that.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:14.900]   As we go today, I am not going to play the normal ending music. Rather, I'm
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.900]   going to mention, I'm going to play for you a very brief story that I think
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:23.900]   you'll enjoy. This is in line with what James and I were talking about there
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:29.900]   at the end regarding tax policy. This is an NPR story. It is 4 minutes and 16
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:35.900]   seconds. It was broadcast on Morning Edition on October 19, 2012. I'm going
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.900]   to put the full 4 minutes and 16 seconds of audio here for you to listen to.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:46.900]   This was back when Mitt Romney and Barack Obama were vigorously debating for
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.900]   that election. I thought it was a really well done story. This was part of a
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:56.900]   larger Marketplace Money story, podcast episode for them. It was episode 387 of
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:03.900]   that show. I will link to that in the show notes as well so that you can listen
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.900]   to that on the NPR blog, on the NPR site. If you're interested, that's a full
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:13.900]   30-minute Marketplace Money episode on how different economists from different
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:18.900]   backgrounds tend to actually agree on a lot of things and how utterly unpalatable
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.900]   it is from an economic perspective. I'm done for the day, but I'll leave you
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:28.900]   with this 4 minute and 16 second excellent story on Morning Edition from almost
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.900]   three years ago. Enjoy.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.900]   When you watch a presidential debate, it's easy to think that the nation is
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.900]   deeply divided over economic policy. But when you talk to the experts, to
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:42.900]   economists, it turns out they agree on an enormous number of issues. Our Planet
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.900]   Money team wondered what it would sound like if you could take some of those
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:51.900]   academic ideas about the economy and put them in a candidate's mouth. NPR's
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.900]   Robert Smith finds out.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.900]   To create a dream candidate, you need a dream team. We took five leading
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.900]   economists of all different stripes, conservative, liberal.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   You could probably describe me as left of center, it'd be fair.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.900]   Pro-market, but not necessarily pro-business.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.900]   I'm a pretty hardcore free market guy.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.900]   I'm a professor of health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   I think of myself as a radical pragmatist.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:17.900]   And we said to this team, put all your differences aside and tell us what can
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.900]   you actually agree on. In an ideal world, what should the presidential
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.900]   candidates be talking about?
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.900]   Luigi Zingales from the University of Chicago Booth School started off with
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.900]   something pretty uncontroversial. The United States tax code is a disaster.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.900]   All the loopholes and differences and in particular, the deductions.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.900]   Now, politicians say this all the time and they rarely give a solution, but our
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.900]   economists all agree on a pretty good way to fix it. The United States, they all
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:49.900]   said, needs to get rid of a giant tax deduction that unfortunately millions of
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.900]   Americans love and enjoy.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.900]   The mortgage interest deduction.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.900]   The mortgage interest deduction.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.900]   Mortgage interest is extremely perverse.
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.900]   If you own a home, pay a mortgage, you can write off the interest on your taxes.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.900]   And if you're one of the lucky ones, it's awesome. A little help from Uncle Sam
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.900]   to live the American dream. But to an economist, a tax break is a
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:13.900]   multi-billion dollar gift to a very particular group. In this case, a group
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.900]   that doesn't always need the money. Here's Dean Baker. He's a liberal with the
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.900]   Center for Economic and Policy Research and a conservative, Luigi Zingales.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.900]   It just makes no sense that, you know, if we have Bill Gates or whoever, some
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:30.900]   very wealthy person, we're subsidizing them to get an expensive home.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:35.900]   So because rich people receive a much larger subsidy, the price of houses
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:40.900]   increase so much that it actually makes less affordable for the poor people.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.900]   If you totally eliminate this deduction, the U.S. government would have an extra
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:49.900]   $100 billion a year to pay down the deficit or maybe lower overall taxes.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.900]   Why wouldn't a politician at least float the idea? Well, we wanted to see how it
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.900]   would sound. So we hired an actor, we wrote him a stump speech, and put him in
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.900]   front of a fake audience.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:06.900]   That's why, when I'm elected president of the United States, I have a special
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:12.900]   plan for the middle class. All of you Americans who own your own homes, I
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:18.900]   promise to raise your tax bill by thousands of dollars a year.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.900]   And that's why no one elects economists.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.900]   Katherine Baker from Harvard says as painful and as unpopular as eliminating
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:29.900]   deductions would be, there is an upside. The system would be more fair, and it
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.900]   would bring in all this extra revenue to the government. So I asked the panel,
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:37.900]   "Any chance with all that extra money you could maybe lower some tax rates too?"
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.900]   Well, our economists did agree on one tax that has to go.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:51.900]   Read my lips. No taxes for corporations. Zero, nada, nothing.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.900]   This is not going to go over well with the middle class either. Right now
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.900]   President Obama and Mitt Romney are advocating lower corporate taxes, but no
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:02.900]   one said get rid of them altogether. But our conservative and liberal economists
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.900]   agree, in principle at least. Here's Dean Baker.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.900]   We don't want to prevent Microsoft or General Motors or whoever it might be
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.900]   from investing more and improving their product line. That's a good thing in my
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:12.900]   view.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:16.900]   Our economists said if you want to tax rich people as part of public policy,
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.900]   tax rich people. Tax the owners of the corporation, but don't tax the profits
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.900]   from the corporation that are reinvested in creating jobs. Now before you think
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.900]   that our economic dream team has nothing but unpopular ideas, there is more to the
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:34.900]   plan. Later today on All Things Considered, our economists say there might just be
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:39.900]   a way to get rid of income taxes altogether. And they unveil their big plan to
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:40.900]   combat illegal drugs.
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.900]   Make them legal.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.900]   And other economic wisdom you won't hear in the debates. Robert Smith, NPR News,
