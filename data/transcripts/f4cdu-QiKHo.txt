[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.080]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.260]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.940]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.560]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.860]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.300]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.580]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.320]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.440]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.600]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.800]   to the general public.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.060]   Today, we're going to talk about the science
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.600]   of tools for fat loss.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.160]   Today's episode is mainly going to be focused
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.820]   on how the nervous system, neurons,
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.460]   and some of the cells they collaborate with,
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400]   like glia and macrophages,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.480]   how those encourage or can encourage accelerated fat loss,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.920]   because it turns out they can.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.300]   Remember, your nervous system,
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.340]   which includes your brain and your spinal cord,
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.520]   and all the connections that they make
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.000]   with the organs of the body,
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.140]   governs everything.
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.700]   The nervous system and the role of the brain
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.240]   and other neurons has been vastly overlooked
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.080]   in the discussion about losing fat.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320]   Now, I would be remiss,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.580]   and I'd probably come under a pretty considerable attack
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.600]   if I didn't just acknowledge up front
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.720]   a core truth of metabolic science
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.320]   and also of neuroscience,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.300]   which is that calories in versus calories out,
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.180]   meaning how many calories you ingest
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.280]   versus how many calories you burn,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.060]   is the fundamental and most important formula
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940]   in this business of fat loss
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.200]   and weight management in general.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.020]   There's simply no way around the fact that if you ingest
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.960]   far more calories than you burn,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.120]   you're likely to gain weight,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.220]   and a good portion of that weight
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.120]   is likely to be adipose tissue, fat.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.100]   It's also true that if you ingest fewer calories than you burn,
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.300]   that you will lose weight,
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.940]   and that a significant portion of that
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.140]   will come from body fat.
[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.620]   What portion depends on the number of factors,
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.540]   but that simple formula is important.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.300]   So a calorie is a calorie as a unit of energy,
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.900]   and we need to accept and acknowledge this calories in,
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.540]   meaning calories ingested versus calories burned formula,
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.560]   but the calories burned portion is strongly influenced
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.940]   by a number of things that you can control
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300]   that can greatly accelerate
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.620]   or increase the amount of adipose tissue
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.420]   or the proportion of adipose tissue
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.980]   that you burn in response to exercise and food.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.760]   Today, we're going to talk about the fact
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.900]   that your body fat of various kinds,
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.640]   and there are several kinds of body fat,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.420]   are actually innervated by neurons.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.240]   Neurons connect to your body fat
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.360]   and can change the probability
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.800]   that that body fat will be burned or not.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.060]   So your nervous system is the master controller
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.020]   of this process,
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.960]   and it plays a strong role in the calories out,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.360]   the calories burned component.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.600]   So let's talk about fat utilization.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.060]   Let's talk about how fat is converted
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.120]   into energy,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.860]   which is sometimes also called fat burning.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.900]   There's two parts to this process.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.120]   One is fat mobilization,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.500]   and the second is fat oxidation or utilization,
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.240]   and that's a process called lipolysis.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.180]   Fat cells can be visceral around our viscera,
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.720]   our organs,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.480]   or they can be subcutaneous under our skin.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.260]   Stored fat has two parts that are relevant here.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   It's got the fatty acid part,
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.140]   and that's the part that your body can use,
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.720]   and that's attached to something called glycerol,
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.480]   and they're linked by a backbone.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.620]   To mobilize fat,
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.820]   you got to break the backbone
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.200]   between glycerol and these fatty acids, okay?
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.840]   That's accomplished by an enzyme called lipase,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.640]   but you can forget all that if you want.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.400]   Remember, we're just trying to mobilize fat.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.840]   So the first step is to get those fatty acids
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.860]   moving around in the bloodstream,
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.640]   to get them out of those fat cells,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.880]   and then they can travel and be used for energy.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.860]   They're going to go into cells
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.360]   that can use them for energy,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.480]   and once they are inside those cells,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.060]   they're still not burned up.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.820]   You need to oxidize them.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.060]   They need to be moved into the mitochondria,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.820]   and then they can be converted into ATP, into energy.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.440]   So just to really zoom out again
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.580]   to make sure I don't lose anybody,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.840]   you got to mobilize the fat,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.540]   then you have to oxidize the fat.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.380]   And many of the things that the nervous system can do
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.200]   is to increase the mobilization of fat,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.160]   but also the oxidation of fat.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   So what are these neurons that connect to fat doing?
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.160]   What are they releasing exactly?
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.500]   How do they actually increase fat mobilization,
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.320]   and how do they increase fat oxidation, burning of fat?
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.760]   Well, there are a couple of things that they release
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.880]   that encourage that process,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.840]   and the main one that you need to know about
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.460]   is epinephrine or adrenaline.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.400]   The conversion of these fatty acids into ATP
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   in the mitochondria of cells is favored by adrenaline, okay?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.540]   And adrenaline is released from two sources.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.640]   Adrenaline is released from the adrenal glands,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.700]   which sit atop our kidneys and our lower back.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.000]   And it's also released
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.840]   from the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.420]   although that name is a bit of a misnomer,
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.720]   because it has nothing to do with sympathy,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.240]   has to do with stimulating alertness
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.820]   and promoting action of the body.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.340]   It was thought for a long time
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.520]   that adrenaline swimming around in your body
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.840]   of when you're fasted,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.960]   because fasting can increase adrenaline,
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   or when you're engaging in intense exercise,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.200]   or when you're stressed,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.740]   is going to promote fat oxidation.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.540]   That's actually not the case.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.840]   The adrenaline that stimulates fat oxidation,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.460]   the burning of fat,
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.620]   is coming from neurons that actually connect to the fat.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.360]   it's a local process.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.420]   And this is very important
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.720]   because it means that what you do,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.240]   the specific patterns of movements
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.020]   and the specific environment you create
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.700]   that can stimulate these particular neurons
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.740]   to activate fat,
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.640]   meaning to release fat,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.560]   to mobilize it,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.380]   and then to burn it
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.260]   is going to be a powerful lever
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.000]   that you can use in order to increase fat loss.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.740]   Okay, so let's talk about
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.340]   how to activate the nervous system
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.640]   in ways that it promotes more liberation,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.540]   movement, mobilization of fat,
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.620]   and more oxidation of fat.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.700]   So one of the most powerful ways
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.260]   to stimulate epinephrine,
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.520]   which is also called adrenaline,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.260]   from these neurons is through movement.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.840]   The type of movement that I'm referring to
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.240]   is extremely subtle.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.220]   Shivering is a strong stimulus
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.920]   for the release of adrenaline,
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.080]   epinephrine into fat,
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.600]   and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.980]   And there are other subtle forms of movement
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.100]   that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.560]   There was a group in England
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.860]   during the 1960s and 70s
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.640]   that discovered a pathway
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.560]   by which subtle forms of movement
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.180]   can greatly increase fat loss.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.580]   This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.200]   It's very famous in the thermogenesis literature.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.140]   And I learned about this early on
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.080]   when I was an undergraduate.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.500]   And I asked,
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.980]   how did they come across this?
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.280]   And here's how the story goes.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   They were aware that some people
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.600]   overeat and yet don't put on weight.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.540]   Other people overeat even just a little bit
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.720]   and they seem to accumulate extra adipose tissue.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.160]   Now, this is long before all the discussions
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.800]   about microbiome and hormone factors.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.580]   And, you know,
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.280]   as long before it,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.460]   many of the hormone factors besides insulin
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.540]   had even been discovered.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.520]   What they did was they examined people
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.460]   who overate and did not gain weight.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.180]   And what they observed was that those people
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.980]   engaged in lots of subtle movement throughout the day.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.560]   In other words,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.800]   they were fidgeters.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.560]   And that's what they call them.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.160]   And in 2015,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.520]   and again in 2017,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.380]   there've been studies that have explored this
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.420]   using some modern metabolic tracking.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.560]   And indeed,
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.780]   simply moving a lot,
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.940]   being a fidgeter,
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.100]   bouncing your knee,
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.640]   standing up and pacing
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.440]   several times or many times throughout the day
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.540]   led to considerable amounts of fat loss
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.300]   and weight loss
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.480]   when people were ingesting the same amount of food.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.680]   If they overate,
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.700]   they were able to compensate
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.180]   and burn off that food.
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.080]   So for people that are overweight
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.960]   who are kind of averse to exercise,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.560]   fidgeting might actually be a good entry point.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.500]   Now, that's great.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.880]   And you can think about the protocols,
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.160]   but I want to nest that protocol
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.300]   in what I said before,
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.720]   which is that fat is controlled by these neurons
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.960]   and the epinephrine they release.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.080]   Those subtle movements of our core musculature,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.940]   not just the core,
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.280]   but all our limbs and our musculature,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.980]   those low-level movements,
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.240]   they trigger epinephrine release from these neurons
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.340]   and they stimulate the mobilization of fat.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.700]   And then that fat is oxidized at higher rates.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.180]   So what's the protocol?
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.760]   Fidget.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.860]   If you're really interested in burning calories
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.880]   and you already exercise,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.700]   you want to burn more
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.080]   or you don't have the opportunity to exercise
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.220]   or you're averse to exercise for whatever reason,
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.700]   fidgeting movements,
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.960]   staccato movements,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.700]   standing up,
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.540]   walking around,
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.080]   pacing,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.220]   all the sort of nervous activities
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.580]   that we're so critical of
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.100]   in other people
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.140]   and sometimes in ourselves
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.020]   are actually mobilizing
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.220]   and oxidizing a lot of fat
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.240]   and a lot of energy.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   And while this probably won't compensate
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.320]   for chronic overeating,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.280]   the caloric burn from this is considerable
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.100]   and very likely can offset
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.620]   a meal that had excessive calories
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.560]   or a kind of steady state of eating too much.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.780]   Now it should make sense
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.260]   why shivering is one of the strongest stimuli
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.420]   that one can incorporate to stimulate fat loss.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.100]   Now shivering is almost always associated with cold.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.820]   We think shivering,
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.420]   we think cold
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.800]   because when we get cold,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.280]   we shiver.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.260]   And there are two ways
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.440]   that shivering can increase fat loss.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.660]   And there are several ways
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.160]   that you can use shivering,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.440]   you can leverage shivering
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.900]   and you can leverage cold
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.280]   to accelerate fat loss,
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.440]   but you have to do it correctly.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.020]   And most of the people
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.040]   that are using cold
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.160]   and frankly suggesting cold
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.140]   as a means to increase metabolism fat loss
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.160]   are suggesting the exact wrong protocol.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.460]   Most people out there
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.180]   are using cold exposure
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.760]   typically by taking cold showers
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   or by getting into cold water
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.560]   or of some other kind,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.460]   a lake or a river
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.400]   or a cold bath
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.520]   or an ice bath.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.640]   Since today we're talking about
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.040]   accelerating fat loss
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.080]   through the use of science-based tools,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.780]   I want to emphasize a study
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.940]   that was published in Nature
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.020]   just a couple of years ago
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.520]   showing exactly how cold
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.340]   increases metabolism and fat loss.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.080]   Okay?
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.220]   So we have several kinds of fat,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.300]   three kinds in fact.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.280]   we have white fat,
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.600]   white adipose tissue,
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.560]   and we have brown fat
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.080]   or brown adipose tissue.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.860]   And there's a third kind
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.900]   which is beige adipose tissue.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.400]   White fat is the type
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.860]   that we traditionally think of
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.800]   as fat,
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.120]   subcutaneous fat.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.720]   and it is not particularly rich
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.640]   in mitochondria.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.380]   It is there as an energy storage site.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.180]   And we have to mobilize the fat out
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.140]   as we talked about before
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.260]   and burn it up elsewhere.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.760]   Brown fat largely exists
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.420]   between our shoulder blades
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.580]   and on the back of our neck
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.420]   between the scapulae.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.800]   and it's rich with mitochondria,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.600]   which is why it's called brown fat.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.360]   And brown fat
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.740]   has a particular
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.860]   biochemical cascade
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.300]   whereby it can take food energy
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.280]   and it can take food basically,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.660]   break it down
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.620]   and convert it into energy
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.700]   within those cells.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.780]   But unlike fatty acids
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.520]   from white fat
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.780]   which have to travel elsewhere,
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.660]   get broken down in mitochondria
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.280]   and convert into ATP,
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:33.820]   et cetera,
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.380]   used by the mitochondria rather,
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.800]   brown fat is thermogenic.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.100]   It can actually use energy directly.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.140]   Cold causes the release
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.060]   of adrenaline from your adrenals
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.080]   and it causes the release
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.220]   of epinephrine
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.220]   from these neurons
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.300]   that connect to fat.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.080]   The paper published in Nature
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.220]   shows that it is shivering itself
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.980]   that causes the brown fat
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.640]   to increase your burning,
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.920]   your burn rate
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.680]   and your metabolism.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.900]   And it works like this.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.260]   When you get into cold,
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.740]   and you shiver,
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.860]   the shivering,
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.660]   that low level movement
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.440]   of the muscle,
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.560]   those small movements,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.760]   triggers the release
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.580]   of a molecule called sucinate,
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.580]   S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E,
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.220]   sucinate.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.600]   And sucinate acts
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.660]   on the brown fat
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.100]   to increase brown fat
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.840]   thermogenesis
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.400]   and fat burning overall.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.820]   The question then
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.860]   is how long
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.140]   to get into that cold environment
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.460]   and how cold should that environment be?
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.700]   So first,
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.320]   let's talk about
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.300]   how long to get
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.380]   into that cold environment.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.640]   It turns out
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   that if you want
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.020]   to trigger the shiver,
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.080]   what you want to do
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.600]   is to get into the cold
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.980]   and then get out of the cold
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.120]   and typically not dry off
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.780]   and then get back
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.380]   into the cold
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.340]   and out of the cold.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.540]   That will definitely
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.840]   stimulate more shivering
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.560]   than just getting
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.840]   into the cold itself.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.140]   So how cold should it be?
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.580]   And look,
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.520]   if you get into water
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.880]   that's very, very cold,
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.440]   it can actually shock your heart.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.440]   It can actually give you
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:03.980]   a heart attack
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.600]   if it's truly, truly ice cold
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.980]   and you're not adapted to that.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.340]   So proceed with caution, please.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.220]   I'm not a physician
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.140]   and I don't want
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.460]   to see anyone get hurt.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.320]   Just cold enough
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.160]   to be uncomfortable
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.680]   is a good place to start.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.220]   So for some of you,
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.680]   that's going to be 60 degrees.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.320]   For some of you,
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.680]   that's going to be 55 degrees.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.400]   For some of you,
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.680]   it's going to be high 30s, right?
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.280]   Depends on how cold adapted you are.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.120]   So what you need to do
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.020]   is find a temperature
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.140]   that you can get into
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.080]   one to five,
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.700]   probably one to three times a week
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.500]   if you really want this
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.660]   to accelerate fat loss
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.100]   and you want to get in
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.400]   until you just start to shiver
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.520]   and then you want to get out
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.040]   and not dry off.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.160]   Wait anywhere from
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.120]   one to three minutes
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.040]   and then get back into the cold.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.860]   So here's a potential
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.760]   kind of sets reps protocol
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.700]   that you can play with.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.500]   Find a temperature
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.800]   that induces shiver for you.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.740]   That's going to vary
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.980]   depending on your cold tolerance
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.260]   and how cold adapted you are.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.360]   One to three,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.700]   maybe five times a week.
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.620]   Get in until you
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.920]   or get under the shower
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.760]   or whatever it is
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.900]   until you start to shiver,
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.900]   genuinely shiver.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.340]   Then after about a minute or so,
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:12.940]   get out.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.940]   Spend one to three minutes out,
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.800]   but don't dry off.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.860]   Get back in
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.500]   for anywhere from
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.560]   one to three minutes,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.020]   but try and access
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.240]   the shiver point again.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.100]   And you might do
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.840]   three repetitions of that.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.040]   So it's three times in
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.440]   and three times out total.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.960]   Next, I'd like to move
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.920]   to exercise
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.780]   and how particular timing
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.340]   and types of exercise
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.880]   can vastly improve fat loss.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.420]   The topic of exercise
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.860]   is a kind of controversial one.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.600]   I think the most simple way,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.440]   the most fluid way
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.520]   to have this conversation
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.540]   about exercise
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.400]   and fat loss
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.800]   is in terms of
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.100]   three general types
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.760]   of training.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.280]   And those are
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.380]   high intensity interval training,
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.000]   so-called HIT,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.880]   H-I-I-T.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.480]   So high intensity interval training,
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.760]   sprint interval training.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.720]   So that's going to be
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.760]   very high intensity
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.640]   or S-I-T
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.720]   or moderate intensity
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.900]   continuous training,
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.240]   M-I-C-T.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.280]   So we've got HIT,
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:08.960]   SIT,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.200]   and MICT.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.120]   If you'd like to map this
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.140]   to VO2 max,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.280]   SIT,
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.560]   this sprint interval training
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.260]   was defined as all out,
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.840]   greater than 100%
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.760]   of VO2 max
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.600]   bursts of activity
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.760]   that last 8 to 30 seconds
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.040]   interspersed
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.780]   with less intense
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.480]   recovery periods.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.220]   So this would be
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.720]   sprinting down field
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.160]   for 8 to 30 seconds,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.980]   then maybe walking back
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.820]   for about a minute or two
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.920]   and then sprinting again
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.560]   and then continuing.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.600]   So that would be SIT.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.260]   HIT,
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.140]   H-I-I-T,
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.620]   it's defined as submaximal,
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.040]   so 80 to 100%
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.020]   of VO2 max,
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.100]   bursts of activity
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.120]   that last 60 to 240 seconds
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.380]   interspersed
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.160]   with less intense
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.980]   recovery periods.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.940]   M-I-C-T,
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.940]   okay,
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.260]   this moderate intensity
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.360]   continuous training
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.360]   is steady state cardio,
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.280]   sometimes called
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   zone two cardio
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:58.840]   these days
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.460]   on the internet,
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.700]   which is performed
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.260]   continuously
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.960]   for 20 to 60 minutes
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.120]   at moderate intensity
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.140]   of 40 to 60%
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.380]   of VO2 max,
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.760]   or if you prefer
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.280]   your heart rate
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.120]   55 to 70%
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.160]   of max heart rate,
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.840]   okay?
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.120]   So we can think
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:14.740]   about high,
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.320]   medium,
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.280]   and low intensity
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:16.960]   exercise,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.160]   although low intensity
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.740]   usually means
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.360]   that you could carry
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.200]   on a conversation
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.880]   or maybe you'd have
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.360]   to gasp
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.400]   every few steps
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:23.760]   or so
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.380]   while trying
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.140]   to talk and run.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:25.900]   That's, I think,
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.760]   going to be
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.600]   the most useful way
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.480]   to have this
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.200]   conversation
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.160]   that we're having now
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.980]   because there's
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.420]   so many different
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.400]   forms of exercise
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.180]   that people do
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.080]   and intensity
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.820]   is important.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.240]   Let's ask the question
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:37.780]   that I think
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.320]   many people
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.640]   are wondering about
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.360]   which is,
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.320]   is it better,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.140]   meaning do you burn
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.820]   more fat
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.120]   if you do your exercise
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.860]   fasted?
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.640]   And fasted
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.340]   in this respect
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.300]   could be
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.480]   that you wake up
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:49.900]   in the morning,
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.540]   you've been fasting
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.080]   all night,
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.540]   you just hydrate
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.280]   and you exercise.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.260]   For short periods
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.720]   of training,
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.680]   it doesn't really
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.560]   seem to matter
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.020]   whether or not
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.180]   you eat before training
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.260]   or you don't
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.460]   if your goal
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.860]   is fat oxidation.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.700]   At a period
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.160]   of about 90 minutes
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.260]   of moderate
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.540]   intensity exercise,
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.900]   there's a switchover
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.620]   point whereby
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.820]   if you ate
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.100]   before the exercise,
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.500]   you will reduce,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.260]   excuse me,
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:17.900]   you will burn
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.180]   far less fat
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.120]   from the 90 minute
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.400]   point onward
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.720]   than you would
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.580]   if you had gone
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.540]   into the training
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.280]   fasted.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.080]   Now,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.420]   there are also
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:28.960]   studies
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.900]   that
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.160]   point to the fact
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:31.640]   that you don't
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.300]   have to wait
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.300]   to 90 minutes
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.540]   in order to get
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.520]   this enhanced
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.840]   fat burning effect.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.560]   If one does
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.760]   high intensity
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.300]   training
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.680]   or even
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.800]   the very high
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.500]   intensity forms
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:43.800]   of training
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.600]   like sprints
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.400]   or squats
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.100]   or deadlifts
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.500]   or any kind
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.880]   of activity
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.480]   that can't be
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:48.880]   maintained
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.540]   for more than
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:49.860]   these,
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.200]   you know,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.560]   eight or I would
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.320]   say up to 60
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.800]   seconds.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.580]   So a set
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.320]   of lifting weights
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.720]   repeated,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.080]   repeated.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.340]   If that's done
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.640]   for anywhere
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.020]   from 20 minutes,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.540]   so weight
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:18:59.960]   training
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.980]   or power
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.300]   lifting
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:01.680]   or these
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:01.980]   kinds of
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.080]   things
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.620]   or kettlebell
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.000]   swings
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.160]   or up to 60
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.640]   minutes,
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.760]   well then
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.700]   the switchover
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.600]   point in which
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.160]   you can burn
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:09.820]   more fat
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.300]   if you go
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:10.760]   into that
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.380]   fasted
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.480]   comes earlier.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.400]   And this
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.080]   makes sense
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.600]   because there's
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.340]   nothing holy
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.200]   about the 90
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.900]   minute point
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.980]   for medium
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.560]   intensity
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.640]   zone 2
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.040]   cardio.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.300]   That 90
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.800]   minute point
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.920]   is the point
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.820]   in which
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.120]   the body
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.900]   shifts over
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.500]   from mainly
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:26.900]   burning
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.600]   glycogen,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.040]   basically
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.840]   sugar that
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.240]   comes from
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.780]   muscles
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.460]   or the
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:31.720]   liver
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.920]   and realizes
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.700]   this is going
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.300]   on for a
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:34.620]   while.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.460]   I'm going
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:35.840]   to shift
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.600]   over to
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.540]   a storage
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.000]   site
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.640]   fuel
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.220]   that is
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:42.840]   in reserve
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.400]   like body
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:43.620]   fat.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.020]   This is
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.380]   something that
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:44.860]   has to do
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.200]   with the
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.540]   milieu
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.540]   of various
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:46.980]   hormones.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.960]   What has
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.420]   to happen
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.060]   is insulin
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.520]   has to
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.320]   go down
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.240]   far enough.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:51.960]   So if you
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.440]   ate before
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.060]   the exercise
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.600]   you'd have
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.020]   an increase
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.600]   in insulin.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.200]   If you
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.740]   ate carbohydrates
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.240]   you'd have
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:56.500]   a bigger
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:56.880]   increase
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.400]   in insulin
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:57.960]   fat
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.760]   and proteins
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.100]   indeed
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.460]   will have
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:19:59.960]   lower
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.640]   amounts
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.060]   of insulin
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:01.560]   and fasting
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:01.980]   will give
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.260]   you the
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:02.640]   lowest
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.280]   amount
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.760]   of insulin.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.520]   Well then
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.120]   that switch
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.600]   over point
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:05.860]   is going
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.140]   to come
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:06.820]   earlier
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.740]   in the
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.360]   exercise.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.040]   And if
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.160]   you think
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:10.460]   about it
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:10.680]   if you were
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:10.920]   to do
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.160]   something
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.460]   high
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:11.860]   intensity
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.640]   for 20
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.080]   30
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.360]   40
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:13.600]   minutes
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:13.860]   so maybe
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.220]   lift
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:14.560]   weights
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.440]   and then
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:15.920]   get into
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.380]   zone 2
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:16.760]   cardio.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.520]   If you
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:17.680]   were
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.360]   fasted
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.760]   the
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.020]   literature
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.380]   says
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:19.520]   that
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:19.640]   you're
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:19.760]   going
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:19.940]   to
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.260]   burn
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.660]   more
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.160]   body
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.580]   fat
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.520]   per
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:22.860]   unit
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.400]   time
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:23.920]   than
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.220]   if
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:24.360]   you
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:24.540]   had
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:24.980]   eaten
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.600]   before
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:25.980]   or
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.800]   during
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.080]   the
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.600]   exercise.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.260]   So what
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.520]   does this
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:28.700]   mean?
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.020]   This means
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.220]   if you
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:29.420]   want to
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:29.600]   burn
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:29.800]   more

[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.480]   fat
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.300]   if
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:31.560]   it's
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:31.840]   in
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:31.980]   your

[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.820]   been

[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:34.740]   this
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.180]   safely
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.820]   exercise
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.560]   intensely

[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.020]   then
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.380]   indeed
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:49.560]   you
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:49.700]   will

[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.020]   and I
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.240]   want to
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:51.500]   emphasize
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:51.860]   that they

[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:53.960]   obviously
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.260]   wouldn't
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:54.500]   want to

[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.420]   seem

[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.140]   so this

[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.840]   I can never

[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.200]   I can't seem
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:21.580]   to pronounce
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.360]   many things
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:22.840]   it seems

[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.780]   is the

[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:30.600]   it's actually
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.580]   a GLP-1

[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.620]   and they go

[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.100]   and again
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.360]   the

[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.920]   is the

[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.960]   so
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.560]   those
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:50.860]   are the

[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:51.800]   that
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.020]   really
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:53.580]   increase

[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:05.960]   for instance
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.920]   berberine

[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.600]   they are
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.140]   very
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:17.700]   potent
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.460]   at reducing

[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.040]   glucose
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.460]   which
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:19.800]   will
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.200]   reduce
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.660]   insulin
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:20.920]   because
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.420]   the job
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:21.660]   of the

[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:23.800]   essentially
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.480]   manage

[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.580]   so there
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:26.820]   are a
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.260]   huge

[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:29.540]   that will

[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.560]   insulin
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.440]   and thereby
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.120]   can increase

[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.480]   oxidation
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.240]   and that's
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:34.720]   because
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.100]   as I
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.340]   mentioned

[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.000]   oxidation
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.640]   this

[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:42.420]   so if
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:42.680]   you keep
