[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.520]   Hey everybody, I'm Chris Hutchins and welcome to All The Hacks.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.360]   I am so excited you're here.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.280]   This show is about upgrading your life, money, and travel all while spending less
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.200]   and saving more.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.120]   And I started it because I'm a diehard optimizer on my own quest to find every
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.800]   hack there is.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.880]   I love doing all the research to get the best experience in life without the
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.720]   expensive price tag and then breaking it down to share with everyone.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.920]   Each episode, I'll talk with a new expert and dive into all their secret deals.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.760]   So today I'm talking to Lee Rowan about travel.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.840]   Not only has Lee been a travel hacker for years, but he also used to be the COO of
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.000]   the Points guy and now runs his own travel company called Savanti, where he and his
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.160]   team help their clients take the most incredible vacations, whether that's
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.040]   optimizing points for free first class flights around the world or finding the
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.560]   best deal for a villa on the Amalfi Coast.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   In our chat, we'll walk through all the hacks you need to know to save money and
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.360]   have an incredible, authentic experience on your next trip.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.160]   Before we jump in, I just want to mention the All The Hacks newsletter.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.440]   It's the other place I'll be sharing all the cool stuff I'm learning about and the
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.520]   new hacks I find.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.200]   So if you're not already subscribed, you can head on over to allthehacks.com/email
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.040]   and get signed up.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.080]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600]   Lee, thanks for being here.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.880]   My pleasure to be here.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.280]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.560]   I think this is the first podcast you've actually done in person this year.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.080]   Is that right?
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.720]   So it's always tricky to find the intersection of vaccinated person who lives
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.920]   nearby that also has all the hacks.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.400]   So thank you for being here and fitting all those criteria.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.720]   Why don't you tell a little bit of background of yourself and let people know
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.920]   how you got to do all this crazy travel stuff.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.320]   Sure.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.080]   I'm here in the Bay Area and I've been in the Bay Area for almost 20 years as an
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   entrepreneur, a startup guy, somebody who's bounced around between advertising
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.840]   and marketing and now finally travel.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.360]   And I came to this role accidentally.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.280]   So I call myself the accidental travel agent.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.680]   And that's because I was a traveler who really figured out how to hack my own
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.080]   travel for me, how to do it the right way, using the right credit cards and points
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.800]   and miles and loyalty games to sit in the best seats and the best aircraft to fly to
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.400]   the best airports with the best service.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.560]   And of course, the best part for me is to stay in the best hotels at the best
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.840]   available rates with the most perks, amenities, upgrades, all that stuff.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.640]   And so the way I really figured it out was by trial and error, by figuring out
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.120]   which online content sources websites had the best news or the best credit card,
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.360]   mileage information, et cetera.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.640]   And I put together this sort of methodology around how to travel.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.520]   So long story short, I was at an ad agency and left that ad agency to go join the
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.360]   points guy. After running that business for a year, I came back to the startup
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.400]   world and really did so because a lot of my friends who were running startups of
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.320]   their own requested me to manage travel for them like I was doing it for me.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.520]   And what that meant was understanding which credit cards they had,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.920]   understanding why they were traveling.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.120]   Was it for work or pleasure?
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.960]   Who was paying?
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.040]   What type of experience they wanted to have?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.000]   So I set up Savanti Travel about five years ago and we do that now full time.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.880]   We're providing full service travel management to busy executives around the
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.680]   Bay Area and around the world, helping them manage all of their travel.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.240]   I thought it would be a great idea to do an episode on breaking down an entire
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.760]   trip, which is something that you guys have probably done for thousands of
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.360]   people, thousands of times and just start at the beginning.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.240]   Right now, I feel like everyone is in need of a vacation.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.160]   I don't know if you've gotten a chance to like explore and leave the Bay Area yet,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.680]   but I'm going to this week and I just I'm very excited.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.440]   The anticipation is real, isn't it?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.640]   That moment you step back on the plane your first time back, there's the sense
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.600]   of release and of relief, right?
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.920]   Because there's so much to be scared about, to be fearful of and the unknown
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.760]   of traveling right now.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.240]   And the reality is that travel is very safe right now, right?
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.080]   There's all those studies about planes and the HEPA filters and all that jazz.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.920]   We don't need to get into that.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.800]   But the reality is travel is safe.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.760]   And if you do it safely and do it correctly, you can have an amazing time.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   So when I think about travel planning right now, whether it's for corporate
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.000]   stuff on the Savanti side or it's for leisure, personal vacations, family
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.720]   trips, whatever, I really think about what's your mindset, right?
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.240]   Like the biggest hack for me is understanding after the trip, what do
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.720]   you want to look back on from that trip and say, this is what I'm trying to
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.880]   achieve with this trip while you're planning it.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.520]   So a great example for me when I'm planning a trip for someone is to
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.000]   actually ask them that question to say, hey, listen, you're back from the trip.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.640]   What did you post on Instagram?
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.680]   What's your social media posts look like?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.960]   What's your memento from that trip that you're like so happy you have
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.840]   because you're so grateful you did it?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.880]   And let's start there and let's work backwards.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.840]   And do people always have an answer or do you have to coach them to get an answer?
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.680]   Some people are like laser focused.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.400]   I'm going back to Italy to sit in my favorite cafe to sip a cappuccino while
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.600]   I watch the pigeons in the square.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.080]   That's their thing and they're going to achieve it.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.600]   And that's great.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.680]   Some people really like they're, they're taking it back by that question.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.200]   They're like, what am I trying to solve for here?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   And so each level of travel planning, I like to break down to what am I
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.160]   trying to solve for here?
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.520]   And if I know what we're trying to solve for with each element of the trip, then
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.600]   we can knock this thing out of the park.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.480]   For me, I feel like maybe I'm just a bit too optimized, but I always start
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.680]   with a really high level goal.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   So it's, I want to go to a beach.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.200]   So in this upcoming trip, I just want to go somewhere warm where I can go to a
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.600]   hotel and sit outside and order good food and relax.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.240]   And the challenge is I didn't actually care where, right?
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.080]   And so it was really tough for me because there's probably, I don't know, 15 places
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.160]   you could go where it's warm, where there's a nice resort, could be Hawaii,
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.880]   could be Mexico, could be Central America, could be the Caribbean.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.680]   And so my biggest challenge is there's an unlimited number of options and I
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.000]   really wanted to focus on price.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.640]   So if I could go to any of those places and one of them was half the cost, I, I
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.560]   wouldn't even really care.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.000]   So, you know, my strategy was if I don't know exactly what I want, it's, is there
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.840]   a place that is like much cheaper than everywhere else?
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.640]   I do that with Google flights destinations.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.320]   You go and you say, I'm in San Francisco.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.840]   I want to go somewhere nonstop.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.080]   We have a nine month old, there's no changing planes.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.160]   And I'm just like browsing around.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.480]   I was like, okay, so Cabo's this much, Cancun's this much, Costa Rica's this
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.760]   much, Hawaii's a little bit more expensive.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.600]   And so that's how I ended up saying, I'm willing to go anywhere that's warm, but I
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.200]   just want to figure out when it's cheapest.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.840]   And you could even say anytime in the next six months and get an idea of the best
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.400]   dates, and it's pretty flexible in searching for that.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.840]   Is that advice you give people?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.400]   Yeah, sure.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.840]   Of course, because that's what we know you're trying to sell for, right?
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.160]   You know that price is the motivating factor next to warmth, right?
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.240]   So assuming warmth, assuming seasonality, assuming now price, now we have to look at
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.560]   how you're going to pay for those tickets.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.200]   If you've got cash, Google flights is fantastic.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.840]   It'll tell you exactly the cheapest airfare you want to find for the markets you want
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.160]   to find it for based on the dates you have, et cetera.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.640]   It's great.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.000]   And if you use the Explore functionality there, it's really incredible.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.880]   There's also a bunch of mileage opportunities, right?
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.160]   And so it depends on what your digital assets are, your mileage, your points that
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.680]   you could use.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.640]   There are some search engines that are really good for that.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.360]   One of them is called Juicy Miles.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.480]   It's a $30 a month subscription.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   If you're really into points and miles, it's great because you can plug in your
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.920]   routing.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.520]   You can take a look at the different credit cards or the different other mileage
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.440]   programs that are there.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.760]   And you can look at how you can pay for those tickets.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.680]   And when you compare those tickets on the mileage side versus what Google flights is
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.960]   charging, you can see side by side sort of what makes sense, what's the good
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.640]   comparison, which asset to use when.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.720]   So we have another episode about miles and credit cards and points.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.240]   And I also made a guide to my top cards and the best signup bonuses right now at
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.000]   allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.440]   So we won't go deep, but is there a just quick rule of thumb you use if you're
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.240]   looking at a flight on United and it's X dollars and Y miles, is there a quick way
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.080]   that you make a decision of whether the miles are maybe a good idea?
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.800]   Yeah, I want to get two cents per mile.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   So what that means is if I'm looking at a thousand dollar airline ticket, if it's
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.640]   basically 50,000 miles or fewer, great deal.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.680]   If it's 64,000 miles, it's a terrible deal.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.720]   And very often right now with a lot of the airlines, they're doing variable pricing.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.840]   So it used to be a set price for a set destination or set of destinations.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.120]   It's no longer that way.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.720]   So you really do have to check, log into your account, take a look at what mileage
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.160]   you have, take a look at what the airline is trying to charge on their publicly
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.240]   available website and figure out what the good deal is.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.080]   By the way, at the end of the day, you're not getting two cents of value per mile.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.200]   Who cares if you feel like you're getting value out of it?
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.640]   Great.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   That's what matters in the end.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.000]   Sometimes it's cash flow, right?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.120]   Like I want to take a vacation.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.400]   I don't have the cash right now.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.600]   Use the miles.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.640]   I never look back.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.120]   Vacation.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.240]   Okay.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.000]   So let's say we're not using miles.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.520]   Does it matter where you buy flights?
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.160]   Can you just buy them on Google flights?
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.640]   Do you buy them on the airline website?
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.440]   Great question.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.480]   So in today's day and age, this is a bit of a whole different conversation a year
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.200]   ago, pre-COVID, but in today's day and age, cancellation and flexibility are the
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.960]   things that matter the most when you're booking travel.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.560]   And so what really matters there is booking directly with the airline and
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.560]   understanding their cancellation policy when you're booking, because that's the
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.760]   policy that you're going to be bound by with those funds that you're using to buy
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.280]   that ticket.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.000]   Now, if you're booking through a third party, let's say Expedia or Travelocity
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.760]   or any of these other online travel agencies, you're fraught with peril.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.480]   If you do that, you're running into an intermediary that's between you and the
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.240]   airline that could really stop up the release of or the change of your ticket.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.680]   So I really caution highly against that.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.280]   Now I'm a little biased because I'm technically a travel advisor in the travel
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.240]   agency community.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.200]   Booking with a travel advisor often makes a lot of sense because travel advisors
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.280]   will have access to special rates, things that are unpublished, net rates, for
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.720]   instance.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.760]   These are on flights.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.520]   These are on flights.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.080]   Correct.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.440]   And so you-
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.720]   Specific kinds of flights?
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.520]   Usually it's international business, but sometimes even domestically there are,
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.120]   with some economy fares even, there are unpublished corporate rates available
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   that travel agencies can tap into.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.680]   So it does actually pay to ask, if you have a travel advisor, what rate you could
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.720]   get on a particular flight, especially if it's an expensive one, right?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.480]   I can't exactly quote things off the top of my head, but let's just say a
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.400]   transcontinental flight from San Francisco to New York would cost $240 one
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.520]   way in economy.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.360]   There's a good chance that there's a corporate rate available, and that might
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   be $179.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.680]   That's a meaningful savings if you're doing that a few times a year, or for a
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.600]   few people on the same flight.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.360]   And are there specific travel advisors that offer these kind of discounted
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.080]   fares, or do you just have to kind of-
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.000]   Best to ask around.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.240]   They tend to be the ones that work with the higher end agencies.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.320]   So you could look at the virtuoso.com website, which is a collection of about,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.280]   I think, 20,000 travel advisors globally, and see if any of those have the
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.760]   particular fares you're looking for.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.680]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.480]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.600]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week, and you have too many
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.560]   manual processes, and there's no one source of truth.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.600]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.800]   37,000, 25, 1.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.200]   37,000.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.720]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.080]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.640]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.960]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.200]   25.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.320]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.160]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.880]   days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.480]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.040]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.920]   system with one source of truth.

[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.200]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.000]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.480]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.400]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.560]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.200]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.800]   purchase.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.280]   You can also load it on your partner's phone, so they always know the best cards
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:03.840]   to use.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.800]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:15.000]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.040]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.880]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.960]   Chase offer in just one click.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.440]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.280]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.200]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well, but if you
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.720]   want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.120]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:51.040]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.080]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.520]   Any tips on picking the flight?
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.000]   You know, when you're going to New York, there's seven airlines.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.040]   If you have a loyalty program and you live in San Francisco and you've decided
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   I'm all in on United, it's an easy choice.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.720]   But if you're sometimes taking an international trip, or if you're going
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.880]   somewhere you don't fly often, and you could fly any airline, is there any quick,
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.680]   easy way?
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.800]   I mean, you probably know this off the top of your head, which airline you want to
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.280]   fly?
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.520]   Who's got the best seats?
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.120]   Is there any hacks to figure out the best one?
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.480]   So unfortunately, the answer is not that easy, because it's a lot of amassed
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.400]   knowledge over time.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.600]   And if you even do look at United, going back to New York for a second, they fly
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.680]   into their hub of Newark from San Francisco.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.320]   But now they also fly into JFK, and they're flying different aircraft to those
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.280]   different destinations.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.360]   So if you're sitting up in business, there's actually quite a difference between
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.720]   a 1-2-1 seating in business on a 777 or on a 787 Dreamliner versus the old school
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.520]   2-4-2 seating in business on a 777 for United going into Newark.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.160]   So it really does pay to actually go onto their website, study the seat map of where
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.600]   you're going to be sitting, and then take a look at reviews.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.840]   Look at online on SeatGuru or any of the review websites to actually find out,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.200]   OK, what's this experience like?
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.720]   By the way, what is this experience like during COVID?
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.160]   Am I going on a five and a half hour flight and they're not serving food?
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.400]   Like, that's going to suck.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.760]   So make sure you plan ahead and you buy food at the airport and you bring water
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.880]   and all of these things you might need for the plane.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.280]   I definitely think that if COVID has taught us anything, it's that everything you knew
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.240]   about travel has completely changed.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.320]   And it's now time to re-research even the stuff that you were super familiar with.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.640]   So feel free to ask people online, reach out to the airline itself, though expect
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.840]   long hold times, maybe Twitter is better for that one.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.400]   But do expect that you've got to do a little bit of research before you get back
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.280]   on the road and make sure you're getting the right experience you want to have.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.120]   Awesome. So when it comes to flight deals, I haven't actually ever tried this, but I
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.240]   was walking through Costco the other day and there's this big banner for like, Costco,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.400]   we plan your vacation, we have flights and hotels.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.000]   Is that ever a good deal?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.320]   No. So here's the thing.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.960]   Costco has its great upsides.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.120]   Rental cars, for instance.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.520]   Incredible rates and deals.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.240]   They have 20-ish percent discount off of publicly available rates.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.200]   You're going to rent a car and you want to use your Costco account.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.760]   Totally do it. It's a great idea.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.680]   Also, all of their car rentals are fully refundable.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.080]   So you could even rent three or four from different car rental agencies and you could
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.560]   easily refund them if you need to.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.600]   Not a problem. Great, great to use them there.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.800]   However, if you do use Costco, I highly recommend if you're going to work with them
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.720]   on the rental car basis, that you actually reconfirm your rental before you rent it,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.600]   before you pick it up.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.000]   So we usually will call for on behalf of our clients.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.960]   We'll call a day or two in advance of their arrival and say, hey, FYI, Chris is coming
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.600]   to town. He rented through Costco.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.160]   Just want to reconfirm everything is up to snuff with his rental so that you, Chris,
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.240]   when you get there, don't have any problems or surprises.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.280]   Yeah. And during COVID, I've seen so many stories lately of rental car companies
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.680]   running out of cars, people renting U-Hauls to drive around Hawaii.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.600]   So this is a great hack.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.920]   Yeah. I was just in The New York Times talking with them about this exact thing.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.040]   It used to be that when you booked a hotel, you'd call the hotel and sort of work with
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.640]   them, but you would never call a rental car.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.120]   Now you're actually doing that more.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.640]   You're calling the branch office at the airport that you're going to.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.360]   Not the 800 number for Hertz, but the actual branch office and saying to them, hey, I'm
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.440]   Chris. I'm going to be arriving this date on this time, this flight.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.560]   Please make sure that my vehicle will be there.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.400]   And they will note it.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.720]   I'll even go so far as to ask the name of the person who will be there at the front
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.720]   desk, because when I check into that counter, if I'm going to the counter, I want to make
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.120]   sure that they know who I am and that they've flagged my vehicle as a VIP vehicle.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   And it works.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.160]   We did it in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago and it was great.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.280]   And it's not VIP that you're someone special.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.760]   It's just you took the time to call.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.160]   Correct. That I actually have a vehicle there.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.280]   They didn't give away to somebody else.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.080]   Yeah. Now you asked about Costco and booking flights.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.040]   The answer, I think, really is no, right.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.000]   Costco is not a good channel to book flights and nor is Expedia or Travelocity, like I
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.720]   said earlier, because you're adding an extra intermediary between you and the airline.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.520]   Now, when you're bundling things together, there is a different option.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.600]   What a bundle is you buy, let's say, a flight and a hotel together.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.320]   And actually for this, I would go directly to the airline.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.360]   Pretty much every major domestic airline has what they call a vacation website.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.120]   Doesn't mean you need to use it for only vacations.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.440]   I may have used it a couple of times to hack a business trip together for somebody.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.360]   But basically, you can book a hotel and an airline flight bundled together at often a
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.840]   lot cheaper than what you would see online for those two separate components.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.600]   And the way you do this is you either book a hotel you're going to use or you maybe you
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.560]   book a hotel you won't use, throw away a hotel and bundle it with the flights you want.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.800]   Good example of this, LA to London can often be seven, eight, ten thousand dollars round
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:42.360]   trip in business. But if you book it on the American Airlines website and you throw in a
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.120]   hotel, you can actually get that seven or eight or ten thousand dollar flight down to
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.120]   even five or six thousand dollars simply by adding in the hotel.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.960]   And why that matters is that you're getting an unpublished sort of special fare that the
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.760]   airline would never market on its own, but they will market it in conjunction with a
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.760]   hotel. Could I just pick a one star hotel and bundle it?
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.080]   Not going to say I've done it a lot of times, but maybe I have.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.760]   Absolutely. Amazing.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.000]   So no Costco, yes, airline vacation websites.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.480]   Exactly. Any other flight hacks?
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.280]   But I think the best thing about flights is to understand in this post-COVID world how
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.400]   flexible they can be.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.640]   And so points and miles really offer a ton of flexibility because even pre-COVID, the
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.400]   worst case scenario with them, you had a two hundred and fifty dollar change in
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.520]   redeposit fee, which was a lot cheaper than the standard published fare of four
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.080]   hundred dollars to change your ticket.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.680]   But nowadays, if you understand what you can do with change and cancellation, you can
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.880]   actually hedge. You can buy a bunch of cheap flights and hold on to them and maybe
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.240]   never use them, but at least revolve them into your next cheap flight.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.120]   It's free to change now. It's free to cancel.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.160]   Unless you have a basic economy fare, which I saw this morning.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.200]   Yeah. All the domestic airlines except one, it was probably maybe JetBlue.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.360]   Basic economy fares have lost their flexibility.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.120]   Correct. If you're taking a flight and you don't care about any of the perks, basic
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.480]   economy may work for you.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   Maybe. Maybe.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.360]   Last minute.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.640]   But I would say always make sure when you're looking on Google flights that you add
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.520]   in a carry on as something you're bringing and you'll notice the fares go up because
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.320]   some of those super cheap flights are basic economy.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.040]   And they're now at the point where if you can't take the flight, there's no refund.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.520]   There's no changing anything.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.120]   So be extra careful with basic economy flights from now forward.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.040]   Cool. OK, so flights.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.360]   We've got flights figured out.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.480]   I actually think that the hotel can make the vacation more than the flight.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.200]   I've had my fair share of flights that were incredible, but the hotel seems to always
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.680]   be what lands everything.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.000]   How do you even begin to start thinking about finding a hotel?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.920]   My biggest challenge, and I wish I had an answer, is when I'm going to a place, I'm
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.360]   just totally overwhelmed.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.800]   There's so many places you can stay.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.000]   Everything seems to be four to four and a half stars on TripAdvisor.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.680]   Right. How do you start to narrow down the scope of all the hotels you can stay at?
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.080]   Yeah. So this is a great question and one that is not easily answerable.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.720]   But my simple answer is this.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.640]   Ask people, ask someone who's been at the destination, ask a travel advisor, ask
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.040]   people on social media, search for hotels in social media.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.720]   Actually, take a look at what Instagram photos people are posting or what reviews
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.440]   they're posting on Twitter even or Facebook.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.080]   A lot of this content is public and it's not available in the TripAdvisor channel,
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.480]   which, again, like you, I think is pretty biased.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.120]   You're either writing a five star review or one star review.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.760]   It doesn't really give you a ton of insight.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.840]   So take a look around at other places online to get good destination advice, but
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.360]   especially ask your friends with good taste or ask people you might know who've
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.680]   recently been to the destination for their advice.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.520]   But I think that the key thing is once you settle in on one or two hotels, really
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.880]   understand from their website, what are they offering?
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.160]   What are the amenities? What's closed during covid?
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.480]   What can you expect when you check in?
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.000]   What are the rooms looking like?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.440]   Is my partial ocean view really of a parking lot?
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.200]   And there's a sliver of an ocean back there.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.640]   Partial ocean view seems like the biggest.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.520]   I feel like I stayed at the Fairmont in Hawaii and I was like, I'm supposed to
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.800]   have a partial ocean view in there.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.440]   Can you see the ocean if you lean over the balcony?
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.320]   I was like, yeah, the lanai overlooking the garden that's been covered in
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.640]   greenery. It's not ocean.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.040]   But really, if you look around online, you'll find the right resources.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.200]   But then there's the question of how do you book it?
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.880]   And I think this is another great example of book direct and book with
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.080]   knowledge. You do not want to go through an intermediary here that's not adding
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   any value. Right.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.200]   You and I chatted recently about TripAdvisor Pro or TripAdvisor Plus or
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.920]   whatever this new thing is that they're putting out.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.640]   And it's an interesting take.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.400]   What it is, it's ninety nine bucks a year and it will theoretically get you
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.880]   cheaper access to the same hotel rooms that you'd see online.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.520]   You don't get benefits and amenities.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.600]   You just get a cheaper price.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.000]   I know anyone thinking about, do I want to spend ninety nine dollars to get a
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.520]   better rate? Is it actually going to be cheaper?
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.000]   No. The net answer is, yes, sure it is.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.200]   To your credit card, it'll be cheaper.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.000]   But the experience will also be cheaper.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.760]   And so therefore, you really don't want to do it.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.960]   OK, here's why.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.240]   What TripAdvisor is doing with their Pro or Plus, whatever it is, thing is
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.080]   they're basically rebating back to you some of their corporate negotiated
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.120]   contract rates.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.840]   So let's say the room is five hundred bucks online, right?
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.040]   It's an expensive room.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.880]   They're going to give you that room for four sixty five.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.960]   And why are they doing that? Because on the back end, they're probably getting
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.880]   whatever, 10 percent off when they market that room as commission or a rebate
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   from the hotel.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.800]   And so they're giving you a portion of that to basically offset the cost.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.480]   Now, that's great.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.600]   But if you actually went to the hotel and you paid five hundred dollars for that
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.640]   room, you'd probably be getting free breakfast.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.080]   What's the value of that? Is it more than thirty five bucks?
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.800]   Probably. Or if you go through a TripAdvisor or your credit card, you may be
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.840]   getting free breakfast and a hundred dollar credit.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.120]   Well, a hundred bucks is clearly more than thirty five.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.640]   So I think what's a really good takeaway here is understand the channel through
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.480]   which you book, because the channel matters the most when it comes to hotels.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   If you can't book it directly for some reason, find a way to book it.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.400]   That's going to get you the best value.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.920]   It might be through a TravelAdvisor.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.840]   It might be through your credit card, might be through like a perk at your
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.800]   company or your office where they have a weird travel portal you've never been to.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.000]   Like, look at that.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.640]   But find the best value for your booking and book there.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.760]   And so booking from the hotel, number one choice.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.880]   What's the experience going to be like if I book from the hotel's website versus
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.720]   Expedia? Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.120]   So in the hotel biz, it's all about relationships.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.800]   What they're looking to do is build a relationship with every guest that comes
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.720]   through that door to make sure that guest will keep coming back over and over again.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.800]   And so when you book directly with the hotel, they have the most amount of
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.960]   information on you as a guest as they can possibly have.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.760]   You book through third party, you book through Expedia or even American Express
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.840]   Travel, which is ironic.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.320]   You come through as Expedia guest in their system.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.640]   That doesn't exactly give them the information they want to know.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   They want to know who you are, why you're traveling.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.800]   Is this business or leisure?
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.120]   You're celebrating something.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.680]   When are you arriving? When are you departing?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.360]   All of these things matter to them because they can customize your stay in a way
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.720]   that when you book through a third party and none of that information is given that
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.720]   they can't. Right.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.240]   So the more info you can give to the hotel, the better.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.840]   And the best way of doing that, honestly, is booking direct and then following up
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.600]   with the hotel with an email to say, hey, I'm Chris.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.320]   I just booked directly on your website.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.720]   This is the room I booked.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   These are the dates I'm staying.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   This is the confirmation number.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.960]   I'd love you to know this about me and share whatever you want to share.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.560]   Oftentimes we, on behalf of our clients, will share social media profiles.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.960]   We'll share where they're coming from on their trip.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.440]   Maybe this is stop one of a five stop trip.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.320]   Maybe they're just coming away for a quick getaway for the weekend.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.280]   Maybe it's just two people staying for the first two nights and then they're joined
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.880]   by the third by on the third night.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.360]   Whatever it is, we're sharing that level of detail.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.640]   This person likes fish.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.280]   They don't like chicken, whatever.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.200]   And the importance there is that they're going to make sure the hotel is going to
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.920]   make sure that they take this data into account and they've really customized the
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.560]   stay to that guest's needs.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.480]   So I don't ever hesitate to send a note to a hotelier and say, hey, this is a
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.040]   really important person to me and here's who they are and here's why.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.680]   And then right before the stay, follow up with them again.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.920]   Hey, Chris is coming to town.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.080]   Please dial him in.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.320]   These are the things that matter.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.880]   But I can do this myself if I don't have a travel agent.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.480]   I can just call and say, or how do I even get the email?
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:12.960]   Email.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.640]   So I think email's best because it's in writing, number one.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.400]   And number two, it allows you to go back to that same email and add to it because
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.520]   you will never really forget something.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.480]   But the best thing to do is to find the email for either the concierge or the
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.200]   reservations team at that hotel.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.400]   When you book online through the website, you'll usually be given an email with a
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.760]   confirmation that actually has that information in it.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.080]   And it might even have the GM or the director of sales or somebody's name.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.760]   We can't wait to welcome you, Chris.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.160]   Sign John Hopkins.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.160]   Oh, you're going to email John Hopkins and let him know you're coming.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.080]   And then John and his team will take care of you.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.560]   And if you don't get an email, is there any like secret to the website or can I
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.120]   just call them and ask them for the email?
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.520]   Call them.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.720]   In fact, call them, get to the front desk and ask somebody at the front desk and
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.160]   say, hey, listen, who can I email and say who I am or who can I email in advance of
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.840]   my stay, just so you guys have a little more information on me and what we're
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.520]   looking to do.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.200]   And is that the concierge?
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.800]   Who is that?
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.400]   They'll direct you to the right person.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.360]   But I highly recommend writing that email because it's going to give a level of
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.680]   depth that the hotel wouldn't have otherwise.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.720]   And it's the best way of hacking your way to an upgrade or hacking your way to a
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.480]   better experience.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.880]   I'm going to Mexico next week.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.280]   I email the front desk and say, hey, I'm coming.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.720]   I'm really excited to stay with you.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.480]   Do you really think that's going to improve the chances I get upgraded?
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.120]   Totally.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.600]   Because what you're going to do is you're going to say, I'm coming with my wife.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.520]   This is our first trip.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.960]   Also coming with a nine month old.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.800]   Can you please confirm that there's a crib in the room?
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.240]   We're arriving at this time.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.720]   Will the room be ready when we arrive?
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.440]   All of these questions you're asking are questions they want to know, that they
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.840]   want to actually have asked to them.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.440]   If you just show up and be like, where's my crib?
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.520]   Didn't you see I have a nine month old?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.080]   Like they're totally caught off guard.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.600]   So they're going to be able to prepare for you in advance.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.560]   And they're going to flag you with a little star on their morning check-in
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:50.960]   lists.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.800]   And they're going to say, okay, this guy's already reached out.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.600]   We know who he is.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.760]   And that's going to give them so much more fodder to work with while you're
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.080]   there.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.400]   Look, it may be that they can't give you an upgrade because they're sold out.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.480]   Maybe they give you a welcome drink or an amenity or something else that you
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.680]   wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.120]   That's very possible.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.440]   You're probably also going to have a letter in your room from the GM being like
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.920]   Chris, thanks for reaching out.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.440]   Thanks for trusting us with your stay.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.160]   Looking forward to making this special.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.560]   You know what?
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.320]   When you get into your room, email the GM and be like, I'm in the room.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:18.960]   It's great.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.080]   Like some more towels or whatever you need.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.120]   And then the GM will take it.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.840]   Nice.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.960]   And I assume I'm not getting any of this if I book through Travelocity.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.200]   They're not going to know who you are.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.320]   They're not even going to know your name is Chris sometimes.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.000]   Like seriously.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.640]   So that's the thing I think is most important to understand is that travel and
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.120]   hotels in particular are all about relationships.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.320]   And so the more you can connect with your hotelier and your destination, the
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.160]   better your experience will be.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.040]   And that also means by the way, that they'll unlock doors for you outside
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.960]   of the hotel in that city, right?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.280]   If you need restaurant recommendations or experiences, they're really a good
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.280]   gatekeeper to help you.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.720]   And I've always wondered, I've asked the concierge for restaurant recommendations.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.680]   And sometimes I feel like I always go and double check.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.640]   I look these restaurants up some hotels.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.280]   They're great.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.640]   Sometimes I'm like, eh, is this place that good?
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.360]   Can you trust the concierge?
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.440]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.520]   The first place they're always going to recommend is the hotel restaurant, right?
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.280]   Cause that's the thing I do.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.920]   Then they're going to recommend their cousin's place for whoever's giving them
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.440]   a kickback.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.800]   But then down the line, there might be some other ones.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.200]   And I'm, I'm grossly overgeneralizing here that I think concierges do incredible
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.000]   work and we'd be lost without them in a lot of ways, but I do think you'd have to
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.240]   take their recommendations with a grain of salt, right?
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.520]   Not every concierge is amazing.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.600]   The Cleft Door people who are really truly spectacular, they know their markets
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.560]   inside and out, and I would listen to them.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.360]   And I'd email them in advance for a guide to the city, right?
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.120]   What can I do?
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.200]   And oftentimes they will be able to provide incredible levels of detail of
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.400]   what's open, what's not, what's happening, what's hot, all of that, and that level
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.000]   of access.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.560]   So definitely leverage them, definitely take what they say with a grain of salt,
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.120]   but know that you can get fantastic access from concierges that you may not
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:57.840]   be able to get yourself.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.960]   I've one time asked, can you give me a restaurant recommendation?
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.600]   I got an okay recommendation.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.440]   And then I was like, I'm going to be here five days.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   Can you give me a few?
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.200]   And then I like looked at number three, number four, and they like, they can't
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.200]   give you five cousins because they probably don't have five cousins, but the
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.080]   third and fourth recommendations were good.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.160]   So that's hotels.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.520]   Sometimes you're just traveling with a big family.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.680]   Maybe you want to rent a house.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.880]   Maybe you want to rent a villa.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.880]   Maybe you want a different experience, Airbnb, VRBO.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.800]   I noticed there's not a lot of comparison shopping, right?
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.520]   It's not like I can go to five sites and see if it's cheaper somewhere else.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.440]   Is there any hacks for trying to book a house or a villa somewhere?
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.200]   Yeah, there are a ton and boy, wouldn't it be great if you could come up with the
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.040]   comparison shopping engine for homes, home rentals, it would be incredible.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.080]   But yeah, the short answer is yes, there are.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.040]   What I like to do is search with a couple of different tabs open, both for VRBO and
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.880]   Airbnb or HomeAway or other hyper-localized sites.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.920]   And the way I've hacked it is oftentimes a lot of these vacation rental properties
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.720]   that are specifically for vacation rentals, right?
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   They're not like somebody's home.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.960]   They're just renting out on the side like we do here, but they're actually vacation
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.280]   rentals. They'll often have their own website that you can book directly on for
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.040]   that home. And the way I find them is I go to Airbnb or VRBO.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:17.280]   I take a couple of the photos from their listings and I run a reverse Google image
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.120]   search. So like a screenshot, the front of the house or the pool or something that's
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.880]   pretty unique to that home.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.840]   And then I'll run it into images.google.com.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.560]   There's a little button you can click to actually upload a photo.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.480]   I'll reverse image search to see, OK, where else is this image listed?
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.120]   And inevitably, if they're listing it on VRBO or if they're listing it on HomeAway,
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.720]   it's going to show up on Google for their actual vacation rental website home
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.880]   address. So I go to that address and I take a look at the rates and say, OK, is it
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.640]   available here? Is it cheaper than I'm seeing on HomeAway or VRBO or Airbnb?
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.200]   Then if so, I just reach out directly through their own website, contact the owner
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.520]   and do the contracting there.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.120]   Oftentimes that can save 10, 15, 20 percent on a home rental.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.760]   So we definitely recommend doing that.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.360]   Also, you get to then know the homeowner before you transact with them.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.440]   So you know if this person's like weird or if they're cool.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.920]   And that's really helpful, too.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.040]   So that's hotels, that's villas.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.600]   Now let's talk about just getting to a country.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.000]   So I'll start with one thing I love to do when I get in a country.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.200]   And I'd love to hear if you have any hacks for what to do, what to see, how to figure
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.760]   it out. But the first thing I always do, unless I'm going to just relax at a beach, is
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.160]   my wife and I book a food tour.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.680]   And there's a ton of sites online that have food tours.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.080]   Airbnb now has these local experiences.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:41.200]   And we'll just go on a three hour tour in the morning, usually go to a market in the
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.320]   middle of the city with someone local.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.280]   You get to see how the market works, how people operate, how selling works.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.920]   We also probably end up eating two or three things.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.000]   And you get to ask a thousand questions about the culture, about the city, learn new
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.160]   stuff. That's like my way to get immersed just right away and really get a sense of
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.760]   what the country's like. But that's my hack.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.800]   I don't have anything else.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.120]   How do you figure out what to do?
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:05.960]   Is there anything you do?
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.160]   So there are two steps to this.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.200]   First is you want to plan way ahead of time what you're going to do.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.560]   But we'll get to that in a second.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.440]   Second is when you get there, what's the first thing you do?
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.400]   And I love the idea of a food tour, right?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.480]   Because there's no better way of really understanding a market or understanding a new
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.480]   place you've ever been.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.120]   I think if you're not into doing a food tour, it's a little too dicey for you right off
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.000]   the bat. I think taking a walking tour with a guide is a great idea.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.320]   You can often find cheap or sometimes even free walking tours, a lot of them leaving
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.880]   from your hotel, for instance, to get to know your neighborhood or an area.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.080]   And that is a great way of not only getting out and working out that jet lag, but also
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.200]   really getting to know how a city operates.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.760]   But let's step back and figure out, OK, we're going to a new place.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.200]   I've got no idea about the destination.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.760]   What do I do? How do I plan this?
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.360]   First things first, always helps to ask around who you know who's been there, who on
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.160]   social media you follow, who's recently been there.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.240]   Just get a taste of that so you can make sure you write down those things on your
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.960]   agenda. Secondly, and this is a hack you showed me, actually, go to your local
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.560]   library, take a look at what guidebooks are available for that area.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.000]   I mean, guidebooks, Lonely Planet, it sounds like it's like an old school 1977 thing.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.440]   It's so valuable.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.240]   Every trip we take, I go look and you don't even have to buy the book for this, by the
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.440]   way, I go to Amazon and I search for the Lonely Planet.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.560]   And the first five pages are like top 25 experiences in this country.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.080]   And I try not to go too micro.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.600]   So I might look at the country guide instead of the city guide, because the country
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.120]   guide might only have two or three things in a major city.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.640]   And I don't want to know the 20 things.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.120]   I want to know the two or three things.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.200]   Right. But the hack that's awesome is there's this Chrome extension.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.920]   I think it works on other browsers, too, called Library Extension.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.880]   And I'll put links to everything we talk about in the show notes.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.880]   But you install it.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:51.080]   And when you're browsing Amazon, if that book is available from a local library in
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:56.600]   digital format for free, which I'd say 50, 60, 70 percent of the time it is, and this
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.040]   isn't just travel books, any book, they immediately link you out to the site and you
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.840]   can go download that book for free and usually get 30, 45 days and you can go through
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.480]   the whole thing. It's amazing.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.320]   Exactly. So I think that reading guidebooks, not only does it bring back the nostalgia
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.920]   of travel of yesteryear, but it also is like a really great way of understanding somebody
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.320]   else's perspective on a city and getting to know through somebody else's eyes what
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.600]   they think should be the top sites.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.680]   And look, in every guidebook, it's always going to be the same top 25, more or less
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.360]   for every city. But when you want to get into specialized experiences, OK, I want to
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.840]   go see Jewish Prague or I want to go on a food crawl in Rome or I want to go on a bar
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.880]   crawl in Ireland.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:41.040]   We turn to destination management companies and DMCs.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.360]   And so the best thing to do is just Google Ireland DMC, right, or Rome DMC, and
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.480]   you'll come back with a bunch of different people, providers who can actually sometimes
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:56.440]   offer free itineraries on their website of what they would take around for clients.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.800]   So are these like tour guides?
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.880]   Yeah, they're a mix of like tour operators and tour guides.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.560]   So tour operators mean somebody who puts together an itinerary, whether it's for one
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.560]   person or a thousand in a city.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.720]   They don't necessarily have a big red open top bus.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.760]   They sometimes are operating at a sprinter vans or even taxis and Ubers, but they're
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.160]   taking you around and showing you the city from the inside with a local guide.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.920]   And sometimes they're great and they're inexpensive.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.240]   Sometimes they're very expensive.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.120]   So you can find a DMC that suits your needs in every market.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.800]   But I think the key thing to do with DMCs is look at what their itineraries are that
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.760]   they're showing online and get a sense of what you'd want to do in that city.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.560]   Maybe it makes sense to reach out to them.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.400]   Maybe it doesn't. Look, if you work with a travel advisor, they'll recommend certain
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.600]   DMCs in certain cities based on your travel profile and what you're looking for.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.200]   But again, that may be overkill for your needs as well.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.720]   And you don't have to book with them, right?
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.480]   You can just look at their itinerary and say, wow, they do these seven things in
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.440]   Jordan. But like this, only this one sounds interesting.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.720]   Let me just search around and find someone that does that.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.640]   Well, bingo. And so for that, we have a bunch of different other micro DMC options.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.120]   A good example of this is there's a local tour guide company called Show Around, and
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.160]   this is less about actually professional tour guides and more about like enthusiastic
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.840]   locals, people who will happily show you their neighborhood or their barrio or
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.880]   whatever it is. So I highly recommend that.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.640]   I also love Eat With.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.600]   They are just like it sounds like a website where you can, it's a marketplace to find
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.680]   people you could eat with.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:27.240]   They're either chefs who are going to cook a meal for you or they're actually people
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.160]   who will show you around on a food tour of a certain area, a destination.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.040]   I want the best pork sugo meatballs in Bologna.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   OK, whatever it is.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.320]   So good. So I definitely recommend finding those kinds of people.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.120]   Another thing we do a lot for clients on their first time in a market is we book a
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.320]   photography session with them.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.640]   And that's because they can really get an experience for a place, but also get some
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.360]   cool like photos to take home for their Christmas cards through the eyes of a local.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.280]   And so there are a number of companies that do this.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.920]   Flytographer is one, Blink is another, but they'll basically set up photo shoots for
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.120]   you and your family or loved ones or whomever in front of the Eiffel Tower or at the
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.000]   Coliseum. And it's a pretty cool way of bringing a memento home, but also getting to
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.880]   see a particular spot in a particular light.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.800]   And I think something that's interesting is the value isn't just someone shows you
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.240]   around town. It's someone who's tapped into what's happening.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:24.600]   So I think we went on a free tour in Buenos Aires and the tour was great.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.480]   We walked around. And by the way, if anyone's considering these free tours at the end of
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.280]   every free tour, there's tips.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.080]   So I wouldn't consider it completely free.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.840]   If you're on a bootstrap budget and you have no money and you say, thank you, I'm so
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.800]   broke, but I just I had to want to take a tour.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.840]   I really appreciate it.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.160]   You're not going to get looked at inappropriately.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.480]   People are going to understand.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   But I think it's such a great way to get to see the city.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.640]   And someone said, oh, yeah, there's a soccer game, football game going on tonight.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:56.520]   You should check it out. And we went to this very untouristic event where the away fans
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:02.760]   are caged off sides, front and top, have to enter the stadium separately because people
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.960]   get into their soccer.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.040]   But that was an experience that doesn't show up on the DMC itinerary or Lonely Planet
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.920]   anywhere because it's so time dependent outside of local just happening to tell you or
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.280]   maybe the concierge. Any other tricks for finding these kind of like cool events or
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.720]   festivals when you're in a city?
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.960]   Number one, leave time in your itinerary for spontaneity because it's going to happen.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.440]   You're going to be at an Irish bar and all of a sudden the crack session happens where
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.600]   the local musicians pull out their gear and you're like, I'm not leaving.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.480]   My day is here. So definitely leave time for spontaneity.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.400]   But also take a look at some of the international media around what events are
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.200]   happening in that city or in that market.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.480]   I actually love Time Out, the international media brand.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.080]   They often have a lot of really good events happening.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.520]   You can check in advance, check it a couple of times.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.720]   You should also reach out to your credit card companies.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:57.120]   Their concierge departments often have static sort of like city guides as well as like
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.480]   a what's happening city guide.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.760]   And if you reach out to them and say, hey, I'm a platinum card holder.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.200]   I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   They'll actually provide you with a bunch of information on a city that you can then use
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.080]   to plan your trip.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.520]   And they can also book things for you.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.000]   So one of the things that I think is always difficult when you're trying to make
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.040]   restaurant reservations in a country when you don't speak the language is that you
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   don't speak the language.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.040]   You know, do I call them?
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.040]   What do I say?
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.880]   And these people for free, right, these concierges linked to your credit cards are
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.880]   completely free.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   They'll not only give you the list, but I'm pretty sure they'll call and make the
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.840]   reservations, too.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.360]   Oh, yeah. And so American Express is a great example of this.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.600]   When I have clients going to Tokyo, the best thing to do is honestly work with the Amex
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:44.000]   concierge to get restaurant reservations because it's a little hard in Japanese when you
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.920]   don't speak Japanese and or the reservations folks at the restaurant aren't so keen to
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.440]   deal with the gringos.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:56.480]   So what ends up happening is we work with Amex Platinum concierge to book a restaurant
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.320]   reservation for someone. And even if they don't take American Express, which is the
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.880]   best part, American Express can make that reservation for you.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.840]   And that's really valuable for us.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.960]   So definitely leverage your credit card companies as much as possible.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   Again, be wary of whose incentives you're working with.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:17.000]   If you're talking to the local hotel concierge or Amex for that matter, just make sure
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.880]   you're getting the biggest picture before you say yes to one answer.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.280]   What does that mean exactly?
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:26.320]   Who's on the take? Who's getting their favorite kickback from someone?
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.640]   That's all. And that can happen even with Amex or Chase's concierge.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.000]   Here's a great example, right?
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.520]   Deep down a rabbit hole of points, American Express, when you call them and say, I want
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.360]   to book a flight, they really want you to use their points to pay for whatever flight
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.720]   that you find that you think is good.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.040]   The reality is you can often get that same flight by using American Express points, but
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.480]   transferring them to a partner.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.320]   And I'm sure you'll go into this on your points and miles chat, but you can transfer
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.800]   those points away from American Express to a partner and book at that partner's
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.160]   website for a lot less than if you actually book through American Express using their
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.200]   points on their website.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.320]   But Amex will tell you that this is the best deal and they won't be looking really out
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.680]   for you. They'll be looking out for them.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.720]   So again, just be careful and be wary.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:17.720]   Talk to people, talk to a travel advisor, look online for reviews before you pull the
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.080]   trigger on any of these credit card company recommended options.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.880]   Cool. Last local recommendation, food.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.160]   Yeah. How?
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.600]   There's nothing better than an amazing meal in another country, I think.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.440]   And if you're coming to San Francisco, I could rattle off a handful of
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.760]   recommendations. And one of the things I like to do sometimes is if I'm looking at a
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.240]   guidebook, I'm like, what do they say to do in San Francisco?
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.160]   And the sad thing is a lot of times the restaurants that aren't the ones you would
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:50.000]   recommend. Are there any ways to find that equivalent list of those great local spots
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.080]   in other countries when things like Yelp and TripAdvisor are just filled with the
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.560]   tourist traps in those countries?
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.920]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.840]   My God. Then it all depends on how daring and adventurous you're willing to be, right?
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.520]   Because if you're going to Iceland and you want to eat whale, like you can do that and
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.800]   there's a way to do that. Do you really want to do it?
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.480]   Like you have to check in with yourself before you go to some of these countries.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.880]   And it can be feel very uncomfortable for North Americans who don't speak a certain
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.640]   language to be in a food hotspot and not know what you're eating or what's put.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.800]   But I'm like, I don't even know what this is, but I'll eat it.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.400]   So I thrive on that, too.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   And I think the best ways of doing that are, number one, just like you said, go on a
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.560]   food tour, right? Get acquainted with the market.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.160]   And then when I say the market, I literally mean the market, where the food comes from
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.120]   and understand how food is bought and sold in a country, what foods are delicious in
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.560]   that country, who eats them.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   Number two is try to find a local with whom you can go out.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.320]   Now, that's not easy, right?
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.200]   A company like Eat With, that'll help you.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.640]   The concierge actually could be very helpful in that.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.880]   And there are certain cities that have hotel concierges that will walk you to the
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.000]   restaurant, help you understand the menu and order for you, and then they'll leave and
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.240]   go back to the hotel. That's an incredible value add when you're clueless in Seoul or
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.960]   you have no idea what you're eating in Shanghai or Chengdu.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.640]   So definitely do that.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.640]   But I think that the best thing to do is to research ahead of time on dishes,
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.320]   experiences and types of restaurants, not necessarily like the name of the place you
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.160]   need to go, but types of restaurants.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.280]   So that when you show up in a city, you can say, hey, listen, I really want to try
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.040]   these things. And you're sitting down with the concierge or you're sitting down with a
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.240]   friendly local you just met.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.600]   How do I do this? And asking vulnerably for some guidance, you'd be amazed by what
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.640]   happens and what you can find.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.560]   Yeah, I've never really thought about it from that perspective.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.800]   But if you go to someone and say, what's the best restaurant, their first answer might
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.960]   be, oh, my buddy's place.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.080]   But if you go and say, where do I get the most authentic?
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.520]   Yeah, give me these dumplings or give me this roasted animal part or whatever it is.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.680]   And like, look, let's face it, that's why we're traveling.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.640]   We want to come back with these memories of, oh, my God, this meal I had.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.680]   And so, yes, use social media ahead of time, find those things, but also give a chance
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.560]   for some spontaneity. Don't think that you have to go to the top place.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:01.240]   Look, I went to a three Michelin star restaurant in Lyon, in France, by a titan of
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.120]   French cuisine, and I thought it was one of the worst meals I've ever had in my entire
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.200]   life.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.560]   But it has to live up to the hype of the hundreds or maybe thousands of dollars you
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:14.520]   spend for it. Most of the best meals I've had are at food stalls, at markets.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.680]   At the Renaud distro in the corner, right?
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.680]   It's yes. Yeah.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.160]   In Bangkok, there's a market.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:24.880]   It's the Or Tor Kor Market, and it's across the highway from the main market.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.240]   But it's just like a giant open community food place.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:32.440]   Yeah. The stalls in there are better than every single expensive restaurant we had.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.640]   And those are the kind of experiences I love.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.760]   And I have no idea if I picked the five star stall.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.240]   I sometimes I'm like, where are all the people that look like they're from here
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.240]   lining up? Yeah.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.520]   And let's just line up behind them.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.240]   And let's point if we don't speak Thai and we like want that thing, maybe it's spicy
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.320]   frog legs. Who cares?
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.600]   You're trying it. It's going to be great.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.440]   And again, in the end, you're going to remember that much more than you're going
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.280]   to remember the fancy three star meal.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:56.920]   One hundred percent.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:02.960]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.160]   for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.600]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.040]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:19.280]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.560]   year old tea trees rich in minerals, theraflavins and catechins.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:28.800]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals and toxic
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.640]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.840]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:41.160]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.960]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.960]   for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:56.080]   metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:56.880]   things to drink.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.000]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits of
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.920]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar and more, and then be happy that
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.080]   Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.640]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free U.S.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.440]   shipping, free returns and a money backed guarantee.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:23.720]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples

[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.960]   addition to your new year routine.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.600]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.

[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.040]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:19.920]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:25.040]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.040]   the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.520]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription.

[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.720]   So that's a great thing.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.240]   You're going to this food stall in the middle of a Thai market, and I'm pretty sure
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.480]   they're not going to take a credit card.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.920]   In fact, I'm certain they're not going to take a credit card.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.840]   How do you get cash when you're going to one of these countries?
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.720]   So the traveler's check is dead.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.040]   OK, exchanging money ahead of time is a terrible idea because you're just going to
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.840]   end up paying through the nose for the exchange rate that you don't want.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.000]   It's not favorable in your direction.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.920]   So what I really recommend to people when they're traveling abroad is bring a couple
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.960]   hundred U.S. dollars in smaller bills in your carry on or somewhere safe with you and
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.400]   then bring an ATM card and make sure you've checked ahead of time with the ATM card
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.520]   that you're going to be able to use it internationally, that they won't hose you on
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.440]   fees and that they know you're traveling right now.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.840]   When you get to the airport in your first destination, go to the first big sort of box
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:55.640]   brand ATM you can find, the HSBC or the Scotiabank or the Citibank or whatever in
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.960]   that airport arrivals hall and get cash out there.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.000]   I usually like to get the max out, right?
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   So if I'm spending three days in a market and I know that I'm going to be spending a
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.960]   lot of cash, Bangkok is a great example.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:11.360]   I'll get whatever my ATM max is, 500 bucks, 750, whatever, just to have that cash on
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.240]   hand. And that's the cash that I'm going to use.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.640]   I'm never going to want to exchange at a hotel.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.920]   The rates are always terrible.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.040]   Never going to want to go to one of those exchange rates with like neon signs in the
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.520]   corner because who knows what they're doing with my passport data.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.960]   And also the rates are terrible.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.520]   And then I don't really want to use some random ATM that the restaurant is walking
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.280]   me to because they say, oh, you have to use this ATM to pay us because we don't take
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.680]   credit. And I ran out of cash.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.520]   So I'm always trying to plan ahead when I'm getting down like the last hundred bucks
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.280]   or so, go take out a couple more hundred, keep it in my pocket, spread it around.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.760]   But I think the key thing is your ATM card is your lifeline for cash.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:50.440]   Don't use any other type of cash unless it's an emergency and you need to.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:55.400]   Yeah. And so I think if you want to make sure you never run out of local currency,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.760]   you're probably going to end your trip with more.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.880]   Obviously, we've all had our fair share of buying ridiculous stuff at the airport
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.240]   before you come home and you're like, I guess I'll burn fifty dollars.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.560]   I need more shot glasses.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.600]   Yeah, right. Yeah. But let's say I've got two or three hundred bucks.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.720]   Any hacks for how to get rid of it without getting hosed on the exchange rate?
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:17.280]   Yeah. So I always keep about 40 or 50 bucks for the airport just in case, in case
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.480]   there's like a departure tax I didn't know about or there's some airport security fee
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.840]   you got to pay in cash or whatever.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.760]   But let's say I've got two hundred bucks in my pocket when I'm checking out of the
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.200]   last hotel, even if it's been on my credit card and even if I want the credit card
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.240]   points, I'll go to the hotel front desk and say, hey, listen, I'd like to buy down
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.520]   one hundred and fifty dollars worth of my hotel bill using this cash.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.880]   They're always going to take the cash.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.600]   They're always going to buy you down or reduce your rate so that you're not putting
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   everything on your credit card and you're not also walking out with a giant wad of
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:49.160]   cash. So I definitely do that or I'll pay for the airport transfer that should have
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.320]   been included in my hotel bill.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.600]   I'll pay for that in cash or whatever it is to basically help burn that last little
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.240]   bit off. Worst case scenario, you bring home a few bucks and you exchange it at the
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.840]   airport in that country before you leave.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.120]   I never like to bring it home to the States because you're just going to get
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:08.040]   screwed. They're just going to once you land and step foot in the States, they know
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.400]   your money that you have in your pocket is worthless to you.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.840]   So they're just going to turn the screws on you.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.360]   And that's we never want that.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.200]   Yeah. And when you're checking out at the hotel and you're finally putting the rest
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.840]   of that hotel on your credit card, please do not choose to be billed in U.S.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:22.920]   dollars. Oh, God, no.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.640]   This whole dynamic currency conversion scam is the worst.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.720]   Basically, what it is, is this banks have gotten really intelligent about how to
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.840]   extract every dollar possible from people.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.360]   And so now you need a hack back.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:38.720]   That's the purpose of this show is like banks and credit card companies and airlines
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.400]   and hotels like I love them.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.560]   I want great experiences, but I also want to find every chance to get the best
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.760]   experience at the best price.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.080]   Yeah. And you don't want to feel like you've been taken for a ride.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:53.200]   And so what what hotels or what credit card companies, banks are doing is they're
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.640]   actually asking you to pay in a Thai hotel in U.S.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.200]   dollars. And that doesn't make any sense.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.600]   When you're in Thailand, you should be using Thai bot.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.320]   So when you're actually presented with the credit card terminal, it's going to say
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:07.520]   press one for Thai bot or press two for U.S.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.640]   dollars. And you might think, jeez, U.S.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.720]   dollars, how easy is that?
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.400]   There's two things wrong here. One, it's called dynamic currency conversion.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.280]   It's a scheme the banks use to basically charge you an inflated interest rate that
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.400]   you're getting screwed on.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:25.640]   OK, and number two, your bank may still charge you a foreign transaction fee if they
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.400]   do so on the U.S.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.080]   dollar transaction because it's coming from Thailand.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.120]   So you could be paying twice once on an overly inflated rate that might be something
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.880]   like 10 or 12 percent more than you need to be paying and two on a foreign exchange
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.200]   rate, which is a foreign exchange fee, which is the worst.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.920]   So take a credit card, pay in Thai bot and make sure it's a card that has no foreign
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.160]   transaction fees. Exactly.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.360]   There's so many cards these days that have no foreign transaction fees.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:51.120]   So make sure that's the case.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.200]   And while you're at it, make sure to tell the credit card company you're traveling
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.120]   because there is nothing worse than showing up in a country and trying to use your
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.720]   credit card or your ATM card, having it not work, having to figure out how you can
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.760]   make that twenty five dollar phone call back to the U.S.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.880]   to get your card enabled.
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.240]   So make sure you give them a heads up so you don't have any problems.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.720]   Speaking of phone calls, one of the hacks I love is trying to get a local SIM card.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.760]   In some countries, this is really hard and you've basically got to go give an I.D.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.160]   and you've got to put a lot of money down.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.000]   And in some countries, a lot of African countries, it's give a dollar and you get a
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.800]   SIM card and you can sell them in the arrivals hall.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.160]   Yeah. And it's super easy.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:33.040]   But the hack here is if you have a phone that supports it, and I think starting with
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:37.800]   maybe the iPhone 11, it's always supported, you can actually have unlimited number of
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.600]   virtual SIM cards in addition to your one SIM card you put in the phone.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.000]   And so call Verizon, go on Verizon's website.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.160]   Google Fi does this.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.840]   A lot of carriers do now convert your Verizon SIM card to an eSIM.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.960]   Now you have your SIM card free.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.200]   So when you're overseas, you can still have your phone on your home carrier, but you can
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:03.760]   get a local SIM card, put it in and say, use my data on this new SIM card.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:07.800]   And then you don't have to worry about pulling out your Verizon card, losing it, not
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:12.080]   being able to take an emergency phone call, but you can actually get local, cheaper data
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.640]   in that country. If you don't have that, a lot of countries now rent out those little
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.280]   like portable hotspots.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.120]   Yeah, little MiFis.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.960]   Yeah. That one's great because then you can use it with the whole family.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:24.720]   You just have to charge it every day and carry a second device.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:29.840]   Any other kind of data phone call hacks when you're traveling?
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.000]   So I always like to download the Google Maps offline version of the city that I'm going
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.920]   to make sure that I have all of the maps ahead of time, because, look, Google Maps, it
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.800]   can just eat your data up when you're traveling abroad and you need it when you're
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.600]   traveling abroad. So because of that, I always download ahead of time.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.680]   I also will use Google Translate as often as possible.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.360]   And I'll actually screenshot, especially when it's some of the Asian languages that are
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.280]   not written in traditional Roman letters.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.080]   I'll screenshot some of this traditional phrases and like flashcards, study them on the
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:03.680]   plane so that I don't have to be using Google Translate consistently when I'm
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:08.520]   overseas. But you can download Google Translate offline also, which is pretty good for
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.680]   me. If I'm looking at a Chinese menu in China, I don't understand it, but you can go
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:17.040]   with Google Translate and you can take a photo and they will in real time translate a
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.640]   photo of a sign in the subway of a menu.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.800]   It's so cool.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.840]   It is so cool. So those two tools I can't live without ahead of time.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:29.960]   But I think that the biggest thing that you can do on the data side is check with your
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.280]   carrier here in the States and say, does it make sense for me to be spending 10 bucks a
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:38.000]   day in Europe or can I buy like a European plan for a month where it's ninety nine
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   bucks or one hundred and twenty five dollars or whatever it is?
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.960]   Check to see if your carrier will offer that.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:46.160]   If you're on the road for a long time, those ten dollar a day charges, especially for a
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.800]   family of four, can really add up.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.880]   Yeah, it's worth considering if you're starting to travel a lot.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.640]   Google Fi, T-Mobile, some carriers have international coverage all around the world
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.600]   with data. Yeah, totally free.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.080]   So I had a Google Fi SIM for a while.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   It's one of the rare cases where I'd say it's so much better experience with Android
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.960]   than it is with iOS, which is a bummer as an iPhone user.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.920]   But it's great for international data.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.400]   And if you travel a lot, it could be worth having that as just a separate backup.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:19.440]   Yeah, I know you could probably get a couple gigs of data on T-Mobile or Google Fi for
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.400]   20, 30 bucks a month, which if you're making a trip every two or three months, it
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.240]   makes total sense. It could make total sense.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.640]   Let me also switch gears for a quick sec and just talk about where you don't want to
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.440]   bring your phone. And that is to places where this might not be safe to have your own
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.640]   iPhone or smartphone.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:39.000]   So maybe you do have a backup burner phone that you can use that you can wipe clean
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.200]   quickly if you need to when you're traveling to sensitive countries.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.600]   Definitely have advised clients who travel overseas to do that, and they've definitely
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.080]   had instances where they've needed to do that.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.840]   So just bring a backup phone or have a backup phone just in case.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:55.000]   And if you're traveling to a country where privacy laws and human rights are
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.280]   challenging, like be careful, like maybe don't bring the computer that has your entire
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.640]   life stored on it. Maybe don't bring the computer that has a Word doc on your desktop
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.040]   with every password to every site and definitely don't carry that around town.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.560]   So we got to the country, we stayed, we figured out the way to hack everything local.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.480]   This was amazing. Now I'm a little disappointed because I just want to go on more
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:20.680]   trips. I feel like hopefully 2021 can shape up to be a year where we can go places.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.080]   Do you have any trips planned?
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:27.240]   So I just got back recently from Turks and Caicos, which was just bananas.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.320]   It was just so beautiful.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.600]   And the beaches are incredible.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.240]   And I can't recommend that destination enough.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   So beautiful. My next trip was supposed to be to Italy this summer.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.320]   Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen work challenges, I think I'll probably have to
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.320]   reschedule that one for later in the year.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.760]   But we do have New York on the docket, a lot of other domestic travel coming up.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.800]   Traveling with little kids during the pandemic has been tricky.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:52.080]   And as you know, vaccinated travelers can now travel overseas fairly easily.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.480]   But if you're under 16 and not vaccinated, there's a big gray area.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.880]   So it should be interesting the next couple of months to see how that unfolds and how
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.640]   we take care of our little ones on the road.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.000]   Yeah. Wow. I didn't even think about that as someone traveling with a nine month old.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.560]   But she'll be fine. But you mentioned your slam with work.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.200]   Can you tell us a little bit more about Savanti?
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.760]   Yeah. So we're full service travel management for busy executives.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.600]   What that means is we handle people's travel just like an accountant would handle their
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.720]   money or a lawyer would handle their legal affairs.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.640]   So we're really on somebody's team.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.960]   So we're not right for everybody in the sense that we don't do any one off trips or
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.160]   plan a single vacation or a honeymoon.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:32.080]   Instead, we get to really know our clients and really operate as an extension of their
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.720]   team so that we help them with everything from Southwest tickets to private jets or
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.520]   holiday and express stay or a private yacht or a villa, everything in between.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:46.720]   But what we've done over the past few years is built up an extensive collection of
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.400]   really good relationships in the travel business that allow us to hack our way for
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.360]   our clients into experiences that they themselves couldn't get on their own.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.920]   So it's been really wonderful and incredibly gratifying to see this business blossom
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.880]   over the past five years to learn so much.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.360]   Oh, my God, there's so much more to learn.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.440]   But every day is a new adventure and is really fun.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.680]   And it's been great to see our clients come out of the sort of pandemic with a renewed
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.160]   sense of excitement around all the destinations that they can't wait to get to.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.280]   We can't wait to help them get there.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.760]   That's awesome. Yeah. If you're listening and you have other questions, hacks, ideas,
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.240]   send them in to our email on all the hacks dot com.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.280]   Maybe we'll bring Lee back again and handle a bunch of questions from the listeners.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.080]   Where can people find you online?
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.200]   So on Twitter at Lee Rowan or at Savanti Travel dot com.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.120]   Chris, thank you so much for having me.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.240]   This is great to chat, travel.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.520]   It's great to see you. It's great to be doing this in person again and actually seeing
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.480]   another human for the first time in so long.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.000]   But thank you for making this happen.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.600]   I really appreciate it. This is amazing.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.520]   I can't wait to get out there and travel.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.360]   And I hope this helps a lot of people do the same.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.280]   Likewise. All right.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.040]   That's it for this episode of all the hacks.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.920]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.960]   I'm just getting started with this show.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.600]   So if you like what you heard, I'd really appreciate a rating in your podcast app or
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.520]   if you'll simply tell a friend about the show, that would be amazing.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.520]   And finally, if you want to find links to anything we discussed today or if you want
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.800]   to share a suggestion for what we can talk about in the future, you can do both at all
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.120]   the hacks dot com.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:29.280]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.040]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.160]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.280]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.120]   clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.680]   It's hosted by my good friend Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.720]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.320]   entertaining. I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.480]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:06.240]   your mind. And it was so crazy to learn things like 35 percent of millennials are not
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.680]   participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.320]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.280]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.160]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.480]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.640]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.560]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.480]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
