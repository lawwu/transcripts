[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.720]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640]   Hey everybody.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins and welcome to All The Hacks.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.360]   I am so excited you're here.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.400]   This show is about upgrading your life, money, and travel, all while
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.200]   spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.920]   And I started it because I'm a diehard optimizer on my own
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.800]   quest to find every hack there is.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.080]   I love doing all the research to get the best experience in life
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.520]   without the expensive price tag, and then breaking it down
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.720]   to share with everyone.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.280]   Each episode, I'll talk with a new expert and dive
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.920]   into all their secret deals.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.760]   So today I'm talking to Lee Rowan about travel.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.240]   Not only has Lee been a travel hacker for years, but he also used to be the
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.480]   COO of The Points Guy and now runs his own travel company called Savanti, where
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.960]   he and his team help their clients take the most incredible vacations, whether
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.640]   that's optimizing points for free first-class flights around the world, or
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.560]   finding the best deal for a villa on the Amalfi Coast.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.200]   In our chat, we'll walk through all the hacks you need to know to save money and
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.400]   have an incredible, authentic experience on your next trip.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.200]   Before we jump in, I just want to mention the All The Hacks newsletter.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.920]   It's the other place I'll be sharing all the cool stuff I'm learning
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.560]   about and the new hacks I find.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   So if you're not already subscribed, you can head on over to
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.080]   allthehacks.com/email and get signed up.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.120]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.600]   Lee, thanks for being here.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.880]   My pleasure to be here.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.280]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.560]   I think this is the first podcast you've actually done in person this year.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.080]   Is that right?
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.480]   So it's always tricky to find the intersection of vaccinated person who
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.920]   lives nearby that also has all the hacks.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.400]   So thank you for being here and fitting all those criteria.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.280]   Why don't you tell a little bit of background of yourself and let people
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.920]   know how you got to do all this crazy travel stuff.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.320]   Sure.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.080]   I'm here in the Bay Area and I've been in the Bay Area for almost 20 years as an
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   entrepreneur, a startup guy, somebody who's bounced around between advertising
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.840]   and marketing and now finally travel.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.360]   And I came to this role accidentally.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.280]   So I call myself the accidental travel agent.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.680]   And that's because I was a traveler who really figured out how to hack my own
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.800]   travel for me, how to do it the right way, using the right credit cards and
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.320]   points and miles and loyalty games to sit in the best seats and the best
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.440]   aircraft to fly to the best airports with the best service.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.600]   And of course, the best part for me is to stay in the best hotels at the best
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.880]   available rates with the most perks and amenities, upgrades, all that stuff.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.640]   And so the way I really figured it out was by trial and error, by figuring out
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   which online content sources, websites had the best news or the best credit
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.360]   card, mileage information, et cetera.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.640]   And I put together this sort of methodology around how to travel.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.920]   So long story short, I was at an ad agency and left that ad agency
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.080]   to go join the points guy.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.120]   After running that business for a year, I came back to the startup world and
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.400]   really did so because a lot of my friends who were running startups of
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.280]   their own requested me to manage travel for them like I was doing it for me.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.520]   And what that meant was understanding which credit cards they had,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.920]   understanding why they were traveling.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.080]   Was it for work or pleasure?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.920]   Who was paying?
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.040]   What type of experience they wanted to have?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.000]   So I set up Savanti Travel about five years ago and we do that now full time.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.760]   We're providing full service travel management to busy executives around
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.640]   the Bay Area and around the world and helping them manage all of their travel.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   I thought it would be a great idea to do an episode on breaking down an entire
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.720]   trip, which is something that you guys have probably done for thousands of
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.320]   people, thousands of times, and just start at the beginning.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.200]   Right now, I feel like everyone is in need of a vacation.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.120]   I don't know if you've gotten a chance to like explore and leave the Bay Area yet,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.640]   but I'm going to this week and I just, I'm very excited.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.400]   The anticipation is real, isn't it?
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.600]   The moment you step back on the plane, your first time back, there's the sense
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.560]   of release and of relief, right?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.360]   Because there's so much to be scared about, to be fearful of and the
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.720]   unknown of traveling right now.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.240]   And the reality is that travel is very safe right now, right?
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.040]   There's all those studies about planes and the HEPA filters and all that jazz.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.760]   We don't need to get into that, but the reality is travel is safe.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.720]   And if you do it safely and do it correctly, you can have an amazing time.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   So when I think about travel planning right now, whether it's for corporate
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.960]   stuff on the Savanti side or it's for leisure, personal vacations, family
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.560]   trips, whatever, I really think about what's your mindset, right?
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.080]   Like the biggest hack for me is understanding after the trip, what do
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.600]   you want to look back on from that trip and say, this is what I'm trying to
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.720]   achieve with this trip while you're planning it.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.360]   So a great example for me when I'm planning a trip for someone is to
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.840]   actually ask them that question to say, Hey, listen, you're back from the trip.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.480]   What did you post on Instagram?
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.520]   What's your social media posts look like?
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.440]   What's your memento from that trip that you're like so happy you have because
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.680]   you're so grateful you did it.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.720]   And let's start there and let's work backwards.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.200]   And do people always have an answer?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.920]   Or do you have to coach them to get an answer?
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.760]   Some people are like laser focused.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.480]   I'm going back to Italy to sit in my favorite cafe to sip a cappuccino while
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.680]   I watch the pigeons in the square.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.360]   That's their thing.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.160]   And they're going to achieve it.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.680]   And that's great.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.760]   Some people really like they're, they're taking it back by that question.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.280]   They're like, what am I trying to solve for here?
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.120]   And so each level of travel planning, I like to break down to what
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.240]   am I trying to solve for here?
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.920]   And if I know what we're trying to solve for with each element of the trip,
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.680]   then we can knock this thing out of the park.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.560]   For me, I feel like maybe I'm just a bit too optimized, but I always start
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.760]   with a really high level goal.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.640]   So it's, I want to go to a beach.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.280]   So in this upcoming trip, I just want to go somewhere warm where I can go to a
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.680]   hotel and sit outside and order good food and relax.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.000]   And the challenge is I didn't actually care where.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.280]   Right.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.840]   And so it was really tough for me because there's probably, I don't
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.480]   know, 15 places you could go where it's warm, where there's a nice resort.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.000]   Could be Hawaii, could be Mexico, could be Central America,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.920]   could be the Caribbean.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.080]   And so my biggest challenge is there's an unlimited number of options.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   And I really wanted to focus on price.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.080]   So if I could go to any of those places and one of them was half the
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.640]   cost, I wouldn't even really care.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   So, you know, my strategy was if I don't know exactly what I want, it's, is there
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.520]   a place that is like much cheaper than everywhere else, I do that with Google
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.040]   flights destinations, you go and you say, I'm in San Francisco, I want to go
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.120]   somewhere nonstop, we have a nine month old, there's no changing planes.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.200]   And I'm just like browsing around.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.520]   I was like, okay, so Cabo's this much, Cancun's this much, Costa Rica's this
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.800]   much, Hawaii's a little bit more expensive.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.600]   And so that's how I ended up saying, I'm willing to go anywhere that's warm, but
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.240]   I just want to figure out when it's cheapest.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.640]   And you could even say anytime in the next six months and get an idea of the
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.320]   best dates.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.440]   And it's pretty flexible in searching for that.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.840]   Is that advice you give people?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.880]   Or sure, of course, because that's what we know you're trying to sell for, right?
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.200]   You know, that price is the motivating factor next to warmth, right?
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.160]   So assuming warmth, assuming seasonality, assuming now price, now we have to look
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.600]   at how you're going to pay for those tickets.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.240]   If you've got cash, Google flights is fantastic.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.640]   It'll tell you exactly the cheapest airfare you want to find for the markets
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.200]   you want to find it for based on the dates you have, et cetera.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.680]   It's great.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.040]   And if you use the explore functionality there, it's really incredible.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.920]   There's also a bunch of mileage opportunities, right?
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.240]   And so it depends on what your digital assets are, your mileage, your
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.720]   points that you could use.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.680]   There are some search engines that are really good for that.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.400]   One of them is called juicy miles.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.520]   It's a $30 a month subscription.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.920]   If you're really into points and miles, it's great because you
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   can plug in your routing.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.120]   You can take a look at the different credit cards or the different other
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.480]   mileage programs that are there.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.800]   And you can look at how you can pay for those tickets.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.320]   And when you compare those tickets on the mileage side versus what Google
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.520]   flights is charging, you can see side by side, sort of what makes sense.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.640]   What's the good comparison, which asset to use one.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.720]   So we have another episode about miles and credit cards and points.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.000]   And I also made a guide to my top cards and the best signup bonuses right now
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   at all the hacks.com/cards.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.400]   So we won't go deep, but is there a just quick rule of thumb you use if you're
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.040]   looking at a flight on United and it's X dollars and Y miles, is there a quick
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.040]   way that you make a decision of whether the miles are maybe a good idea?
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.760]   I want to get 2 cents per mile.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.560]   So what that means is if I'm looking at a thousand dollar airline ticket, if
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.600]   it's basically 50,000 miles or fewer, great deal.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   If it's 64,000 miles, it's a terrible deal.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.200]   And very often right now with a lot of the airlines, they're doing variable
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.680]   pricing.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.800]   So it used to be a set price for a set destination or set of destinations.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.080]   It's no longer that way.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.280]   So you really do have to check, log into your account, take a look at what
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.080]   mileage you have.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.400]   Take a look at what the airline is trying to charge on their publicly available
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.160]   website and figure out what the good deal is.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.520]   By the way, at the end of the day, you're not getting 2 cents of value per
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.720]   mile. Who cares?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.560]   If you feel like you're getting value out of it, great.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   That's what matters in the end.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.960]   Sometimes it's cashflow, right?
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.040]   Like, I want to take a vacation.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.320]   I don't have the cash right now.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.520]   Use the miles.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.320]   I never look back.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.040]   Anything that gets you the vacation.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.640]   Right.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.160]   Okay.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.920]   So let's say we're not using miles.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.440]   Does it matter where you buy flights?
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.120]   Can you just buy them on Google flights?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.560]   Do you buy them on the airline website?
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.360]   Great question.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.240]   So in today's day and age, this would have been a whole different conversation a
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.960]   year ago, pre-COVID, but in today's day and age, cancellation and flexibility
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.880]   are the things that matter the most when you're booking travel.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.520]   And so what really matters there is booking directly with the airline and
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   understanding their cancellation policy when you're booking, because that's the
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.720]   policy that you're going to be bound by with those funds that you're using to buy
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.240]   that ticket.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.960]   Now, if you're booking through a third party, let's say Expedia or Travelocity
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.680]   or any of these other online travel agencies, you're fraught with peril.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.440]   If you do that, you're running into an intermediary that's between you and the
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.200]   airline that could really stop up the release of or the change of your ticket.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.640]   So I really caution highly against that.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.000]   Now, I'm a little biased because I'm technically a travel advisor in the
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.200]   travel agency community.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.160]   Booking with a travel advisor often makes a lot of sense because travel advisors
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.240]   will have access to special rates, things that are unpublished, net rates, for
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:11.680]   instance.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.720]   These are on flights.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.480]   These are on flights.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.040]   That's correct.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   And so you...
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.680]   Specific kinds of flights?
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.520]   Usually it's international business, but sometimes even domestically, there are
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.120]   with some economy fairs even, there are unpublished corporate rates available
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   that travel agencies can tap into.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.480]   So it does actually pay to ask, if you have a travel advisor, what rate you
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.200]   could get on a particular flight, especially if it's an expensive one.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.680]   Right?
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.480]   I can't exactly quote things off the top of my head, but let's just say a
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.400]   transcontinental flight from San Francisco to New York would cost $240 one
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.520]   way in economy.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.320]   There's a good chance that there's a corporate rate available and that might
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   be $179.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.640]   That's a meaningful savings if you're doing that a few times a year, or for a
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.560]   few people on the same flight.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.320]   And are there specific travel advisors that offer these kind of discounted
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.080]   fares, or do you just have to kind of...
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.960]   Best to ask around.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.200]   They tend to be the ones that work with the higher end agencies.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.280]   So you could look at the virtuoso.com website, which is a collection of about,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.240]   I think, 20,000 travel advisors globally, and see if any of those have the
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.720]   particular fares you're looking for.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.080]   You all know I love credit card points.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.880]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today, which is one of my
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.720]   favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.880]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.520]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.120]   purchase.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.600]   You can also load it on your partner's phone so they always know the best cards
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.160]   to use.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.120]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.320]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.360]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.240]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.320]   Chase offer in just one click.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.800]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.640]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.560]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well, but if you
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.120]   want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.480]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.440]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.480]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.360]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.080]   I get it.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.280]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.680]   hang.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.720]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.160]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.200]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.040]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.440]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.960]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.600]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.000]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.520]   yours.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.440]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.680]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.320]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.720]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.680]   found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly.com.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.600]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.000]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.760]   Any tips on picking the flight?
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.240]   You know, when you're going to New York, there's seven airlines.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.360]   If you have a loyalty program and you live in San Francisco and you've decided I'm
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.280]   all in on United, it's an easy choice.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.960]   But if you're sometimes taking an international trip, or if you're going
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.120]   somewhere you don't fly often, and you could fly any airline, is there any quick,
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.920]   easy way?
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.040]   I mean, you probably know this off the top of your head, which airline you want to
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.520]   fly?
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.760]   Who's got the best seats?
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.360]   Is there any hacks to figure out the best one?
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.680]   So, unfortunately, the answer is not that easy, because it's a lot of amassed
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.600]   knowledge over time.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.800]   And if you even do look at United, going back to New York for a second, they fly
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.880]   into their hub of Newark from San Francisco.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.560]   But now they also fly into JFK, and they're flying different aircraft to those
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.480]   different destinations.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.600]   So, if you're sitting up in business, there's actually quite a difference between
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.920]   a 1-2-1 seating in business on a 777 or on a 787 Dreamliner versus the old school
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.720]   2-4-2 seating in business on a 777 for United going into Newark.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.400]   So, it really does pay to actually go onto their website, study the seat map of where
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.880]   you're going to be sitting, and then take a look at reviews.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.080]   Look at online on SeatGuru or any of the review websites to actually find out,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.480]   "OK, what's this experience like?
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.960]   By the way, what is this experience like during COVID?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.400]   Am I going on a five and a half hour flight, and they're not serving food?
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.680]   Like, that's going to suck."
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.960]   So, make sure you plan ahead, and you buy food at the airport, and you bring water,
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.120]   and all of these things you might need for the plane.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.480]   I definitely think that if COVID has taught us anything, it's that everything you knew
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.320]   about travel has completely changed, and it's now time to re-research even the stuff
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.520]   that you were super familiar with.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.840]   So, feel free to ask people online, reach out to the airline itself, though expect
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.440]   long hold times, maybe Twitter is better for that one, but do expect that you've got
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.960]   to do a little bit of research before you get back on the road, and make sure you're
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.480]   getting the right experience you want to have.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.520]   Awesome.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.640]   So, when it comes to flight deals, I haven't actually ever tried this, but I was walking
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.800]   through Costco the other day, and there's this big banner for like, "Costco, we plan
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.640]   your vacation, we have flights and hotels."
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.240]   Is that ever a good deal?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.680]   No.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.600]   So, here's the thing.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.200]   Costco has its great upsides.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.360]   Rental cars, for instance.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.760]   Incredible rates and deals.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.480]   They have 20-ish percent discount off of publicly available rates.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.320]   You're going to rent a car, and you want to use your Costco account, totally do it.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.000]   It's a great idea.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.920]   Also, all of their car rentals are fully refundable.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.320]   So, you could even rent three or four from different car rental agencies, and you could
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.800]   easily refund them if you need to.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.600]   Not a problem.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.840]   Great, great to use them there.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.800]   However, if you do use Costco, I highly recommend, if you're going to work with
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.440]   them on the rental car basis, that you actually reconfirm your rental before you
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.680]   rent it, before you pick it up.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.560]   So, we usually will call for, on behalf of our clients, we'll call a day or two in
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.640]   advance of their arrival and say, "Hey, FYI, Chris is coming to town.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.760]   He rented through Costco.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.280]   Just want to reconfirm everything is up to snuff with his rental, so that you, Chris,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.400]   when you get there, don't have any problems or surprises."
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Yeah, and during COVID, I've seen so many stories lately of rental car companies
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.880]   running out of cars, people renting U-Hauls to drive around Hawaii.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.720]   So, this is a great hack.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.040]   Yeah, I was just in the New York Times talking with them about this exact thing.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.840]   It used to be that when you booked a hotel, you'd call the hotel and sort of
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.800]   work with them, but you would never call a rental car.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.240]   Now, you're actually doing that more.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.760]   You're calling the branch office at the airport that you're going to.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.680]   Not the 800 number for Hertz, but the actual branch office and saying to them,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.920]   "Hey, I'm Chris.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.600]   I'm going to be arriving on this date, on this time, this flight.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.680]   Please make sure that my vehicle will be there."
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.640]   And they will note it.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.840]   I'll even go so far as to ask the name of the person who will be there at the front
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.440]   desk, because when I check in at that counter, if I'm going to the counter, I
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.320]   want to make sure that they know who I am and that they've flagged my vehicle as a
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.240]   VIP vehicle.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.200]   And it works.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.240]   We did it in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago, and it was great.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.360]   And it's not VIP that you're someone special.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.840]   It's just, you took the time to call.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.240]   Correct.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.240]   That I actually have a vehicle there.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.400]   They didn't give away to somebody else.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.200]   Now, you asked about Costco and booking flights.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.160]   The answer, I think, really is no, right?
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.240]   Costco is not a good channel to book flights, and nor is Expedia or
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.640]   Travelocity, like I said earlier, because you're adding an extra intermediary
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.800]   between you and the airline.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.560]   Now, when you're bundling things together, there is a different option.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.640]   What a bundle is, you buy, let's say, a flight and a hotel together.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.360]   And actually, for this, I would go directly to the airline.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.400]   Pretty much every major domestic airline has what they call a vacation website.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.200]   Doesn't mean you need to use it for only vacations.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.120]   I may have used it a couple of times to hack a business trip together for
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.200]   somebody, but basically you can book a hotel and an airline flight bundled
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.000]   together at often a lot cheaper than what you would see online for those
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.960]   two separate components.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.920]   And the way you do this is you either book a hotel you're going to use, or
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.840]   you, maybe you book a hotel you won't use, throw away hotel, and bundle it
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.680]   with the flights you want.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.920]   Good example of this, LA to London can often be seven, eight, $10,000 round
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.600]   trip in business.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.440]   But if you book it on the American Airlines website and you throw in a
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.600]   hotel, you can actually get that seven or eight or $10,000 flight down to even
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.200]   five or $6,000 simply by adding in the hotel.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.120]   And why that matters is that you're getting an unpublished sort of special
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:46.240]   fare that the airline would never market on its own, but they will market it in
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   conjunction with a hotel.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.880]   Could I just pick a one-star hotel and bundle it?
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.160]   Not going to say I've done it a lot of times, but maybe I have.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.240]   Absolutely.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.880]   Amazing.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.120]   So no Costco, yes, airline vacation websites.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.640]   Exactly.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.600]   Any other flight hacks?
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:05.040]   I think the best thing about flights is to understand in this post-COVID world,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.560]   how flexible they can be.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.600]   And so points and miles really offer a ton of flexibility because even pre-COVID,
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.960]   the worst case scenario with them, you had a $250 change in redeposit fee, which
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.920]   was a lot cheaper than the standard published fare of $400 to change your
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.240]   ticket.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.640]   But nowadays, if you understand what you can do with change and cancellation, you
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.760]   can actually hedge, you can buy a bunch of cheap flights and hold onto them and
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.360]   maybe never use them, but at least revolve them into your next cheap flight.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.320]   It's free to change now.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.200]   It's free to cancel.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.000]   Unless you have a basic economy fare, which I saw this morning, all the
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.440]   domestic airlines, except one, it was probably maybe JetBlue, basic economy
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.440]   fares have lost their flexibility.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:46.840]   Correct.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.200]   If you're taking a flight and you don't care about any of the perks, basic
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.560]   economy may work for you.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.080]   Maybe.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.800]   Maybe.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.440]   Last minute.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.960]   But I would say always make sure when you're looking on Google flights that
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.760]   you add in a carry on as something you're bringing, and you'll notice the
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.920]   fares go up because some of those super cheap flights are basic economy, and
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.680]   they're now at the point where if you can't take the flight, there's no
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.720]   refund, there's no changing anything.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.320]   So be extra careful with basic economy flights from now forward.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:12.960]   Cool.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.600]   Okay.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.560]   So flights, we've got flights figured out.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.720]   I actually think that the hotel can make the vacation more than the flight.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.000]   I've had my fair share of flights that were incredible, but the hotel seems to
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.920]   always be what lands everything.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.280]   How do you even begin to start thinking about finding a hotel?
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.800]   My biggest challenge, and I wish I had an answer, is when I'm going to a place,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.560]   I'm just totally overwhelmed.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.040]   There's so many places you can stay.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.280]   Everything seems to be four to four and a half stars on TripAdvisor.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.560]   Right.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.880]   How do you start to narrow down the scope of all the hotels you can stay at?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.040]   So this is a great question and one that is not easily answerable, but my simple
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.480]   answer is this, ask people, ask someone who's been at the destination, ask a
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.240]   travel advisor, ask people on social media, search for hotels in social media.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.960]   Actually, take a look at what Instagram photos people are posting or what reviews
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.600]   they're posting on Twitter even, or Facebook.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.760]   A lot of this content is public and it's not available in the TripAdvisor
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.720]   channel, which again, like you, I think is pretty biased.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.360]   You're either writing a five-star review or a one-star review.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.000]   It doesn't really give you a ton of insight.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.840]   So take a look around at other places online to get good destination advice,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.440]   but especially ask your friends with good taste or ask people you might know
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.880]   who've recently been to the destination for their advice.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   But I think that the key thing is once you've settled in on one or two hotels,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.040]   really understand from their website, what are they offering?
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.960]   What are the amenities?
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.360]   What's closed during COVID?
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.720]   What can you expect when you check in?
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.200]   What are the rooms looking like?
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.960]   Is my partial ocean view really of a parking lot and there's a
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.400]   sliver of an ocean back there?
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.600]   Partial ocean view seems like the biggest, I feel like, I stayed at the
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.760]   Fairmont in Hawaii and I was like, I'm supposed to have a partial ocean view.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.640]   And they're like, can you see the ocean if you lean over the balcony?
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.600]   And I was like, yeah, the lanai overlooking the garden that's
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.840]   been covered in greenery, it's not ocean.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.200]   But really, if you look around online, you'll find the right resources.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.400]   But then there's the question of how do you book it?
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.560]   And I think this is another great example of book direct and book with knowledge.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.720]   You do not want to go through an intermediary here that's
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.400]   not adding any value, right?
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.440]   You and I chatted recently about TripAdvisor Pro.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.120]   Or TripAdvisor Plus or whatever this new thing is that they're putting out.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.840]   And it's an interesting take.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.320]   What it is, it's 99 bucks a year.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.560]   And it will theoretically get you cheaper access to the same
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.120]   hotel rooms that you'd see online.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.680]   You don't get benefits and amenities.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.800]   You just get a cheaper price.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.840]   I know anyone thinking about, do I want to spend $99 to get a better rate?
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.800]   Is it actually going to be cheaper?
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.320]   No.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.160]   The net answer is, yeah, sure it is.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   To your credit card, it'll be cheaper, but the experience will also be cheaper.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.960]   And so therefore you really don't want to do it.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.480]   Okay.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.080]   Here's why.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.880]   What TripAdvisor is doing with their Pro or Plus, whatever it is, thing is they're
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.360]   basically rebating back to you some of their corporate negotiated contract rates.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.040]   So let's say the room is $500 online, right?
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   It's an expensive room.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.080]   They're going to give you that room for $465.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.280]   And why are they doing that?
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.680]   Because on the backend, they're probably getting whatever, 10% off when they market
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   that room as commission or a rebate from the hotel.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.080]   And so they're giving you a portion of that to basically offset the cost.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.760]   Now that's great.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.680]   But if you actually went to the hotel and you paid $500 for that room, you'd
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.960]   probably be getting free breakfast.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.000]   What's the value of that?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.360]   Is it more than 35 bucks?
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.040]   Probably.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   Or if you go through a TravelAdvisor or through your credit card, you may be
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.120]   getting free breakfast and a hundred dollar credit.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.360]   Well, a hundred bucks is clearly more than 35.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.880]   So I think what's a really good takeaway here is understand the channel through
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.720]   which you book, because the channel matters the most when it comes to hotels.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.080]   If you can't book it directly for some reason, find a way to book it that's
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.600]   going to get you the best value.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.120]   It might be through a TravelAdvisor.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.320]   It might be through your credit card.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.080]   It might be through like a perk at your company or your office where they have a
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.960]   weird travel portal you've never been to.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.800]   Like, look at that, but find the best value for your booking and book there.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.120]   And so booking from the hotel, number one choice, what's the experience going to be
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.600]   like if I book from the hotel's website versus Expedia?
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.920]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.360]   So in the hotel biz, it's all about relationships.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.040]   What they're looking to do is build a relationship with every guest that comes
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.960]   through that door to make sure that guest will keep coming back over and over again.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.040]   And so when you book directly with the hotel, they have the most amount of
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.200]   information on you as a guest as they can possibly have.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.960]   You book through third party, you book through Expedia or even American Express
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.040]   travel, which is ironic.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.840]   You come through as Expedia guest in their system that doesn't exactly give them the
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840]   information they want to know.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.880]   They want to know who you are, why you're traveling.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.000]   Is this business or leisure?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.320]   You're celebrating something.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.160]   When are you arriving?
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:41.880]   When are you departing?
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   All of these things matter to them because they can customize your stay in a way that
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.040]   when you book through a third party and none of that information is given, that they
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.960]   can't, right?
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.440]   So the more info you can give to the hotel, the better.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.200]   And the best way of doing that, honestly, is booking direct and then following up with
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.840]   the hotel with an email to say, hey, I'm Chris.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.560]   I just booked directly on your website.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.920]   This is the room I booked.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.960]   These are the dates I'm staying.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   This is the confirmation number.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.200]   I'd love you to know this about me and share whatever you want to share.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.760]   Oftentimes, we, on behalf of our clients, will share social media profiles.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.160]   We'll share where they're coming from on their trip.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.640]   Maybe this is stop one of a five stop trip.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.560]   Maybe they're just coming away for a quick getaway for the weekend.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.640]   Maybe it's just two people staying for the first two nights and then they're joined by
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.080]   the third, on the third night.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.560]   Whatever it is, we're sharing that level of detail.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.880]   This person likes fish.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.680]   They don't like chicken.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.520]   Whatever.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.440]   And the importance there is that they're going to make sure, the hotel is going to
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.160]   make sure that they take this data into account and they've really customized the
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.760]   stay to that guest's needs.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.960]   So I don't ever hesitate to send a note to a hotelier and say, hey, this is a really
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.240]   important person to me and here's who they are and here's why.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.880]   And then right before the stay, follow up with them again.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.120]   Hey, Chris is coming to town.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.280]   Please dial him in.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.520]   These are the things that matter.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.080]   But I can do this myself if I don't have a travel agent.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.680]   I could just call and say, or how do I even get the email?
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.160]   Email.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.840]   So I think email's best because it's in writing, number one.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.600]   And number two, it allows you to go back to that same email and add to it because
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.720]   you will inevitably forget something.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.680]   But the best thing to do is to find the email for either the concierge or the
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.400]   reservations team at that hotel.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.600]   When you book online through the website, you'll usually be given an email with a
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.960]   confirmation that actually has that information in it.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.280]   And it might even have the GM or the director of sales or somebody's name.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.920]   We can't wait to welcome you, Chris.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.360]   Signed, John Hopkins.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   You're going to email John Hopkins and let him know you're coming.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.280]   And then John and his team will take care of you.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.760]   And if you don't get an email, is there any like secret to the website or can I
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.320]   just call them and ask them for the email?
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:35.720]   Call them.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.920]   In fact, call them, get to the front desk and ask somebody at the front desk and
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.360]   say, hey, listen, who can I email and say who I am or who can I email in advance of
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.040]   my stay, just so you guys have a little more information on me and what we're
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.720]   looking to do.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.400]   And is that the concierge?
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:48.960]   Who is that?
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.560]   They'll direct you to the right person.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   But I highly recommend writing that email because it's going to give a level of
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.840]   depth that the hotel wouldn't have otherwise.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.920]   And it's the best way of hacking your way to an upgrade or hacking your way to a
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.680]   better experience.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.080]   I'm going to Mexico next week.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.480]   I email the front desk and say, hey, I'm coming.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.920]   I'm really excited to stay with you.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.680]   Do you really think that's going to improve the chances I get upgraded?
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.320]   Totally.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.800]   Because what you're going to do is you're going to say, I'm coming with my wife.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.720]   This is our first trip.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.160]   Also coming with a nine month old.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.000]   Can you please confirm that there's a crib in the room?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.440]   We're arriving at this time.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.920]   Will the room be ready when we arrive?
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.640]   All of these questions you're asking are questions they want to know, that they
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.040]   want to actually have asked to them.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.640]   If you just show up and be like, where's my crib?
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.720]   Didn't you see I have a nine month old?
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.280]   Like they're totally caught off guard.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.800]   So they're going to be able to prepare for you in advance.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.760]   And they're going to flag you with a little star on their morning check-in
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.160]   lists.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.000]   And they're going to say, okay, this guy's already reached out.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.800]   We know who he is.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.960]   And that's going to give them so much more fodder to work with while you're
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.280]   there.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.600]   Look, it may be that they can't give you an upgrade because they're sold out.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.680]   Maybe they give you a welcome drink or an amenity or something else that you
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.880]   wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.320]   That's very possible.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.640]   You're probably also going to have a letter in your room from the GM being like
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.120]   Chris, thanks for reaching out.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.640]   Thanks for trusting us with your stay.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.360]   Looking forward to making this special.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.760]   You know what?
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.520]   When you get into your room, email the GM and be like, I'm in the room.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.160]   It's great.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.280]   Like some more towels or whatever you need.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.320]   And then the GM will take care of you.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.040]   Nice.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.160]   And I assume I'm not getting any of this if I book through Travelocity.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.360]   They're not going to know who you are.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.520]   They're not even going to know your name is Chris sometimes.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.200]   Like seriously.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.840]   So that's the thing I think is most important to understand is that travel and
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.320]   hotels in particular are all about relationships.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.520]   And so the more you can connect with your hotelier and your destination, the
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.360]   better your experience will be.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.240]   And that also means by the way, that they'll unlock doors for you outside
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.160]   of the hotel in that city, right?
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.480]   If you need restaurant recommendations or experiences, they're really a good
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   gatekeeper to help you.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.920]   And I've always wondered, I've asked the concierge for restaurant recommendations.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.880]   And sometimes I feel like I always go and double check.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.480]   I look these restaurants up, some hotels, they're great.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.840]   Sometimes I'm like, eh, is this place that good?
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.520]   Can you trust the concierge?
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.600]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.480]   The first place they're always going to recommend is the hotel restaurant,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:57.680]   right?
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.480]   Cause that's what they got to do.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.000]   Then they're going to recommend their cousin's place or whoever's giving
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.640]   them a kickback.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.000]   But then down the line, there might be some other ones.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.960]   And I'm, I'm grossly overgeneralizing here that I think concierges do
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.160]   incredible work and we'd be lost without them in a lot of ways.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.560]   But I do think you do have to take their recommendations with a grain of
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.400]   salt, right?
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.680]   Not every concierge is amazing.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.400]   The Cleft Door people who are really truly spectacular, they know their
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   markets inside and out.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.840]   And I would listen to them and I'd email them in advance for a guide to the
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.560]   city, right?
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.320]   What can I do?
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.400]   And oftentimes they will be able to provide incredible levels of detail of
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.360]   what's open, what's not, what's happening, what's hot, all of that and that
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.200]   level of access.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.400]   So definitely leverage them, definitely take what they say with a grain of
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.320]   salt, but know that you can get fantastic access from concierges that you may not
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.040]   be able to get yourself.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.160]   I've one time asked, can you give me a restaurant recommendation?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.800]   I got an okay recommendation.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.640]   And then I was like, I'm going to be here five days.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   Can you give me a few?
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.400]   And then I like looked at number three, number four, and they like, they can't
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   give you five cousins because they probably don't have five cousins, but the
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.280]   third and fourth recommendations were good.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.360]   So that's hotels.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.720]   Sometimes you're just traveling with a big family.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.880]   Maybe you want to rent a house.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.080]   Maybe you want to rent a villa.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   Maybe you want a different experience, Airbnb, VRBO.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.960]   I noticed there's not a lot of comparison shopping, right?
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.720]   It's not like I can go to five sites and see if it's cheaper somewhere else.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.640]   Is there any hacks for trying to book a house or a villa somewhere?
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.400]   Yeah, there are a ton and boy, wouldn't it be great if you could come up with the
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.240]   comparison shopping engine for homes, home rentals, it would be incredible.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.280]   But yeah, the short answer is yes, there are.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.240]   What I like to do is search with a couple of different tabs open, both for VRBO and
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.080]   Airbnb or HomeAway or other hyper localized sites.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.120]   And the way I've hacked it is oftentimes a lot of these vacation rental properties
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.920]   that are specifically for vacation rentals, right?
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   They're not like somebody's home.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.080]   They're just renting out on the side.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.920]   Like we do here.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.520]   But they're actually vacation rentals.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.960]   They'll often have their own website that you can book directly on for that home.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.240]   And the way I find them is I go to Airbnb or VRBO.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.480]   I take a couple of the photos from their listings and I run a reverse Google image
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.040]   search.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.320]   So like a screenshot, the front of the house or the pool or something that's
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.120]   pretty like unique to that home.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.080]   And then I'll run it into images.google.com.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.800]   There's a little button you can click to actually upload a photo.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.720]   I'll reverse image search to see, okay, where else is this image listed?
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.360]   And inevitably, if they're listing it on VRBO or if they're listing it on HomeAway,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.960]   it's going to show up on Google for their actual vacation rental website, home
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.360]   address.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.120]   So I go to that address and I take a look at the rates and I say, okay, is it
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.000]   available here?
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.880]   Is it cheaper than I'm seeing on HomeAway or VRBO or Airbnb?
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.120]   Then if so, I just reach out directly through their own website, contact the
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.720]   owner and do the contracting there.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.360]   Oftentimes that can save 10, 15, 20% on a home rental.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.000]   So we definitely recommend doing that.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.640]   Also, you get to then know the homeowner before you transact with them.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.680]   So you know if this person's like weird or if they're cool and that's really
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.160]   helpful too.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.320]   So that's hotels, that's villas.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.880]   Now let's talk about just getting to a country.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.680]   So I'll start with one thing I love to do when I get in a country and I'd love to
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.840]   hear if you have any hacks for what to do, what to see, how to figure it out.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.160]   But the first thing I always do, unless I'm going to just relax at a beach, is my
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.440]   wife and I book a food tour.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.920]   And there's a ton of sites online that have food tours.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.320]   Airbnb now has these local experiences.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:27.400]   And we'll just go on a three-hour tour in the morning, usually go to a market in
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.560]   the middle of the city with someone local.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.560]   You get to see how the market works, how people operate, how selling works.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.200]   But you also probably end up eating two or three things and you get to ask a
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.800]   thousand questions about the culture, about the city, learn new stuff.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.480]   That's like my way to get immersed just right away and really get a sense of what
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.920]   the country's like, but that's my hack.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.960]   I don't have anything else.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.280]   How do you figure out what to do?
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.160]   Is there anything you do?
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.360]   So there are two steps to this.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.120]   First is you want to plan way ahead of time what you're going to do, but we'll get
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.760]   to that in a second.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.600]   Second is when you get there, what's the first thing you do?
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.560]   And I love the idea of a food tour, right?
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.440]   Because there's no better way of really understanding a market or understanding a
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.680]   new place you've never been.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.040]   I think if you're not into doing a food tour, it's a little too dicey for you
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.680]   right off the bat.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.160]   I think taking a walking tour with a guide is a great idea.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.200]   You can often find cheap or sometimes even free walking tours, a lot of them
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.040]   leaving from your hotel, for instance, to get to know your neighborhood or an area.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.760]   And that is a great way of not only getting out and working out that jet lag,
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.360]   but also really getting to know how a city operates.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.880]   But let's step back and figure out, okay, we're going to a new place.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.400]   I've got no idea about the destination.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.000]   What do I do?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.880]   How do I plan this?
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.400]   First things first, always helps to ask around who you know who's been there, who
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.320]   on social media you follow who's recently been there.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.400]   Just get a taste of that so you can make sure you write down those things on your
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:44.800]   agenda.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.600]   Secondly, and this is a hack you showed me, actually, go to your local library.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.680]   Take a look at what guidebooks are available for that area.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.880]   I mean, guidebooks, Lonely Planet, geez, sounds like it's like an old school,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.120]   1977 thing.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.600]   It's so valuable.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.160]   Every trip we take, I go look, and you don't even have to buy the book for this,
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.600]   by the way, I go to Amazon and I search for the Lonely Planet.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.720]   And the first five pages are like top 25 experiences in this country.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.280]   And I try not to go too micro.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.520]   So I might look at the country guide instead of the city guide, because the
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.360]   country guide might only have two or three things in a major city.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.840]   And I don't want to know the 20 things.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.320]   I want to know the two or three things.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.400]   But the hack that's awesome is there's this Chrome extension.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.120]   I think it works on other browsers, too, called library extension.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.120]   And I'll put links to everything we talk about in the show notes.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.080]   But you install it.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.280]   And when you're browsing Amazon, if that book is available from a local library in
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.440]   digital format for free, which I'd say 50, 60, 70 percent of the time it is.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.360]   And this isn't just travel books, any book.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.120]   They immediately link you out to the site and you can go download that book for free
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.800]   and usually get 30, 45 days and you can go through the whole thing.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.680]   It's amazing.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.520]   Exactly.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.920]   So I think that reading guidebooks, not only does it bring back the nostalgia of
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.840]   travel of yesteryear, but it also is like a really great way of understanding
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.760]   somebody else's perspective on a city and getting to know through somebody else's
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.800]   eyes what they think should be the top sites.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.880]   And look, in every guidebook, it's always going to be the same top 25, more or less
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.480]   for every city. But when you want to get into specialized experiences, OK, I want
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.800]   to go see Jewish Prague or I want to go on a food crawl in Rome or I want to go on a
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.080]   bar crawl in Ireland.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.280]   We turn to destination management companies and DMCs.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:33.560]   And so the best thing to do is just Google Ireland DMC, right, or Rome DMC, and
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.960]   you'll come back with a bunch of different people, providers who can actually
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.800]   sometimes offer free itineraries on their website of what they would take around
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.640]   for clients.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.000]   Are these like tour guides?
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.080]   Yeah, they're a mix of like tour operators and tour guides.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.600]   So tour operators mean somebody who puts together an itinerary, whether it's for
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.760]   one person or a thousand in a city.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.920]   They don't necessarily have a big, you know, red open top bus.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.680]   They sometimes are operating at a sprinter vans or even taxis and Ubers.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.760]   But they're taking you around and showing you the city from the inside with a
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.120]   local guide. And sometimes they're great and they're inexpensive.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.440]   Sometimes they're very expensive.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.320]   So you can find a DMC that suits your needs in every market.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.000]   But I think the key thing to do with DMCs is look at what their itineraries are that
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.960]   they're showing online and get a sense of what you'd want to do in that city.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.760]   Maybe it makes sense to reach out to them.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.640]   Maybe it doesn't. Look, if you work with a travel advisor, they'll recommend certain
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.840]   DMCs in certain cities based on your travel profile and what you're looking for.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.400]   But again, that may be overkill for your needs as well.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.920]   And you don't have to book with them, right?
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.680]   You can just look at their itinerary and say, wow, they do these seven things in
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.600]   Jordan. But like this, only this one sounds interesting.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.920]   Let me just search around and find someone that does that.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.840]   Well, bingo. And so for that, we have a bunch of different other micro DMC options.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.760]   A good example of this is there's a local tour guide company called Show Around.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.560]   And this is less about actually professional tour guides and more about like
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.360]   enthusiastic locals, people who will happily show you their neighborhood or their
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.600]   barrio or whatever it is.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.080]   So I highly recommend that.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.880]   I also love Eat With.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.600]   They are, just like it sounds like, a website where you can go to a marketplace to
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.880]   find people you could eat with.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.440]   They're either chefs who are going to cook a meal for you or they're actually people
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.360]   who will show you around on a food tour of a certain area, a destination.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.240]   I want the best pork sugo meatballs in Bologna.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   OK, whatever it is.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.520]   So good. So I definitely recommend finding those kinds of people.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.320]   Another thing we do a lot for clients on their first time in a market is we book a
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.520]   photography session with them.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:35.840]   And that's because they can really get an experience for a place, but also get some
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.120]   cool like photos to take home for their Christmas cards through the eyes of a
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.480]   local. And so there are a number of companies that do this.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.160]   Flytographer is one, Blink is another.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.720]   But they'll basically set up photo shoots for you and your family or loved ones or
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.880]   whomever in front of the Eiffel Tower or at the Coliseum.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.760]   And it's a pretty cool way of bringing a memento home, but also getting to see a
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.040]   particular spot in a particular light.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.000]   And I think something that's interesting is the value isn't just someone shows you
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.400]   around town. It's someone who's tapped into what's happening.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:10.760]   So I think we went on a free tour in Buenos Aires and the tour was great.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.560]   We walked around. And by the way, if anyone's considering these free tours at the end
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.440]   of every free tour, there's tips.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.240]   So I wouldn't consider it completely free.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.000]   If you're on a bootstrap budget and you have no money and you say, thank you, I'm so
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.960]   broke, but I just I had to want to take a tour.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.000]   I really appreciate it.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.280]   You're not going to get looked at inappropriately.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.600]   People are going to understand.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   But I think it's such a great way to get to see the city.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.760]   And someone said, oh, yeah, there's a soccer game, football game going on tonight.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:42.240]   You should check it out. And we went to this very untouristic event where the away
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:48.440]   fans are caged off sides, front and top have to enter the stadium separately because
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.120]   people get into their soccer.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.280]   But that was an experience that doesn't show up on the DMC itinerary.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.920]   Or Lonely Planet anywhere, because it's so time dependent outside of local just
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.120]   happening to tell you or maybe the concierge.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.400]   Any other tricks for finding these kind of like cool events or festivals when you're
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.520]   in a city? Number one, leave time in your itinerary for spontaneity because it's
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.720]   going to happen. You're going to be at an Irish bar and all of a sudden the crack
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.320]   session happens where the local musicians pull out their gear and you're like, I'm
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.880]   not leaving. My day is here.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.840]   So definitely leave time for spontaneity, but also take a look at some of the
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.960]   international media around what events are happening in that city or in that
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.640]   market. I actually love Time Out, the international media brand.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.240]   They often have a lot of really good events happening.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.680]   You can check in advance, check it a couple of times.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.880]   You should also reach out to your credit card companies.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:43.200]   Their concierge departments often have static sort of like city guides, as well as
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.680]   like a what's happening city guide.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.200]   And if you reach out to them and say, hey, I'm a platinum card holder, I have a
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.280]   Chase Sapphire Reserve, they'll actually provide you with a bunch of information on
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   a city that you can then use to plan your trip.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.720]   And they can also book things for you.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.160]   So one of the things that I think is always difficult when you're trying to make
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.240]   restaurant reservations in a country when you don't speak the language is that you
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   don't speak the language.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.200]   You know, do I call them?
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.920]   What do I say? And these people for free, right?
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.080]   These concierges linked to your credit cards are completely free.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.040]   They'll not only give you the list, but I'm pretty sure they'll call and make the
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.360]   reservations, too. Oh, yeah.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.520]   And so American Express is a great example of this.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.480]   When I have clients going to Tokyo, the best thing to do is honestly work with the
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.560]   Amex concierge to get restaurant reservations, because it's a little hard in
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:33.640]   Japanese when you don't speak Japanese and or the reservations folks at the
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:36.560]   restaurant aren't so keen to deal with the gringos.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.320]   So what ends up happening is we work with Amex Platinum concierge to book a
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.560]   restaurant reservation for someone.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.400]   And even if they don't take American Express, which is the best part, American
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.040]   Express can make that reservation for you.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.000]   And that's really valuable for us.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.080]   So definitely leverage your credit card companies as much as possible.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.120]   Again, be wary of whose incentives you're working with.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.840]   If you're talking to the local hotel concierge or Amex, for that matter, just
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.040]   make sure you're getting the biggest picture before you say yes to one answer.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.440]   What does that mean exactly?
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.440]   Who's on the take? Who's getting their favorite kickback from someone?
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.160]   That's all.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.840]   And that can happen even with Amex or Chase's concierge.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.200]   Here's a great example, right?
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.360]   Deep down a rabbit hole of points, American Express, when you call them and
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.880]   say, I want to book a flight, they really want you to use their points to pay for
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   whatever flight that you find that you think is good.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.680]   The reality is you can often get that same flight by using American Express
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.720]   points, but transferring them to a partner.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.160]   And I'm sure you'll go into this on your points and miles chat, but you can
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.600]   transfer those points away from American Express to a partner and book at that
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   partner's website for a lot less than if you actually booked through American
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.440]   Express using their points on their website.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:53.040]   But Amex will tell you that this is the best deal and they won't be looking
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:53.920]   really out for you.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.920]   They'll be looking out for them.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.960]   So again, just be careful and be wary.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.840]   Talk to people, talk to a travel advisor, look online for reviews before you pull
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.320]   the trigger on any of these credit card company recommended options.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:07.840]   Cool.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.120]   Last local recommendation, food.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.840]   How there's nothing better than an amazing meal in another country, I think.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.640]   And if you're coming to San Francisco, I could rattle off a handful of
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.520]   recommendations.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   And one of the things I like to do sometimes is if I'm looking at a guidebook,
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.440]   I'm like, what do they say to do in San Francisco?
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.240]   And the sad thing is a lot of times the restaurants that aren't the ones you
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.400]   would recommend, are there any ways to find that equivalent list of those great
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.680]   local spots in other countries when things like Yelp and TripAdvisor are just
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.760]   filled with the tourist traps in those countries?
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.120]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.600]   My God.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.080]   Then it all depends on how daring and adventurous you're willing to be, right?
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.280]   Because if you're going to Iceland and you want to eat whale, like you can do
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   that and there's a way to do that.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.000]   Do you really want to do it?
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.720]   Like you have to check in with yourself before you go to some of these countries
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.880]   and it can be feel very uncomfortable for North Americans who don't speak a
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.520]   certain language to be in a food hotspot and not know what you're eating or
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:03.880]   what's put on.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.000]   I'm like, I don't even know what this is, but I'll eat it.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.560]   So I thrive on that too.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   And I think the best ways of doing that are number one, just like you said, go on
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.480]   a food tour, right?
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.760]   Get acquainted with the market.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.840]   And then when I say the market, I literally mean the market, where the food
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:19.640]   comes from and understand how food is bought and sold in a country, what foods
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.760]   are delicious in that country, who eats them.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.920]   Number two is try to find a local with whom you can go out.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.560]   Now that's not easy, right?
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.400]   A company like Eat With, that'll help you.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.880]   The concierge actually could be very helpful in that.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.040]   And there are certain cities that have hotel concierges that will walk you to
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.960]   the restaurant, help you understand the menu and order for you, and then they'll
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   leave and go back to the hotel.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.800]   That's an incredible value add when you're clueless in Seoul or you have no
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.160]   idea what you're eating in Shanghai or Chengdu.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.880]   So definitely do that.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   But I think that the best thing to do is to research ahead of time on dishes,
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.240]   experiences, and types of restaurants.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.840]   Not necessarily like the name of the place you need to go, but types of
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.920]   restaurants so that when you show up in a city, you can say, "Hey, listen, I
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.080]   really want to try these things."
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.240]   And you're sitting down with the concierge or you're sitting down with a
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.440]   friendly local you just met.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.800]   "How do I do this?"
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.840]   And asking vulnerably for some guidance, you'd be amazed by what
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   happens and what you can find.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.760]   Yeah, I've never really thought about it from that perspective.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.880]   But if you go to someone and say, "What's the best restaurant?"
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.120]   Their first answer might be, "Oh, my buddy's place."
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.240]   But if you go and say, "Where do I get the most authentic..."
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.680]   Yeah, "Give me these dumplings," or "Give me this roasted animal
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   part," or whatever it is.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.880]   And look, let's face it, that's why we're traveling.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.840]   We want to come back with these memories of, "Oh, my God, this meal I had."
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.640]   And so, yes, use social media ahead of time, find those things.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.760]   But also, give a chance for some spontaneity.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   Don't think that you have to go to the top place.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.880]   Look, I went to a three Michelin star restaurant in Lyon, in France, by a
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.800]   titan of French cuisine, and I thought it was one of the worst meals I've
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.400]   ever had in my entire life.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.240]   But it has to live up to the hype of the hundreds or maybe thousands of
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.400]   dollars you spend for it.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.720]   Most of the best meals I've had are at food stalls, at markets.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.880]   At the random bistro in the corner, right?
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.480]   Yes.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.920]   In Bangkok, there's a market, it's the Or Tor Kor Market.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.880]   And it's across the highway from the main market, but it's just like a
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.440]   giant open community food place.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.280]   The stalls in there are better than every single expensive restaurant we
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.840]   had, and those are the kind of experiences I love.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.960]   And I have no idea if I picked the five-star stall.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.000]   I sometimes am like, where are all the people that look like they're from
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.720]   here lining up, and let's just line up behind them.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.960]   And let's point, if we don't speak Thai and we like want that thing, maybe
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.520]   it's spicy frog legs, who cares?
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.080]   You're trying it.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:37.840]   It's going to be great.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.600]   And again, in the end, you're going to remember that much more than you're
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.480]   going to remember the fancy three-star meal.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.160]   A hundred percent.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.640]   I just want to thank you, Kwik, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.480]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.120]   So that's a great thing.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.400]   You're going to this food stall in the middle of a Thai market, and I'm pretty
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.840]   sure they're not going to take a credit card.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.320]   In fact, I'm certain they're not going to take a credit card.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.200]   How do you get cash when you're going to one of these countries?
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.080]   So the traveler's check is dead.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.400]   Okay.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.360]   Exchanging money ahead of time is a terrible idea because you're just going
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.240]   to end up paying through the nose for the exchange rate that you don't want.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.360]   It's not favorable in your direction.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.040]   So what I really recommend to people when they're traveling abroad is bring a
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.400]   couple hundred US dollars in smaller bills in your carry-on or somewhere safe
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.320]   with you, and then bring an ATM card.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.160]   And make sure you've checked ahead of time with the ATM card that you're going
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.720]   to be able to use it internationally, that they won't hose you on fees, and that
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.800]   they know you're traveling right now.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:45.680]   When you get to the airport in your first destination, go to the first big sort of
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.880]   box brand ATM you can find, the HSBC, or the Scotiabank, or the Citibank, or
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.320]   whatever, in that airport arrivals hall and get cash out there.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.360]   I usually like to get the max out, right?
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.320]   So if I'm spending three days in a market and I know that I'm going to be spending
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.840]   a lot of cash, Bangkok is a great example, I'll get whatever my ATM max is, 500
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.000]   bucks, 750, whatever, just to have that cash on hand.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.560]   And that's the cash that I'm going to use.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.960]   I'm never going to want to exchange at a hotel.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.280]   The rates are always terrible.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.400]   Never going to want to go to one of those exchange rates with like neon signs on the
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.480]   corner, because who knows what they're doing with my passport data, and also the
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.360]   rates are terrible.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.880]   And then I don't really want to use some random ATM that the restaurant is walking
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.520]   me to because they say, "Oh, you have to use this ATM to pay us because we don't
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.040]   take credit," and I ran out of cash.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.840]   So I'm always trying to plan ahead when I'm getting down like the last hundred bucks
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.600]   or so, go take out a couple more hundred, keep it in my pocket, spread it around.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.120]   But I think the key thing is your ATM card is your lifeline for cash.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.720]   Don't use any other type of cash unless it's an emergency and you need to.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.160]   And so I think if you want to make sure you never run out of local currency, you're
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.080]   probably going to end your trip with more.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.200]   Obviously, we've all had our fair share of buying ridiculous stuff at the airport
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.680]   before you come home, and you're like, "I guess I'll burn $50 on silly souvenirs."
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.920]   I need to do more shot glasses.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.960]   But let's say I've got two or three hundred bucks.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.040]   Any hacks for how to get rid of it without getting hosed on the exchange rate?
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.920]   So I always keep about $40 or $50 for the airport just in case, in case there's like
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:18.040]   a departure tax I didn't know about, or there's some airport security fee you got
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.160]   to pay in cash or whatever.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.200]   But let's say I've got $200 in my pocket.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.680]   When I'm checking out of the last hotel, even if it's been on my credit card, and
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.840]   even if I want the credit card points, I'll go to the hotel front desk and say,
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.840]   "Hey, listen, I'd like to buy down $150 worth of my hotel bill using this cash."
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.160]   They're always going to take the cash.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.560]   They're always going to be able to buy you down or reduce your rate so that you're
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.280]   not putting everything on your credit card and you're not also walking out with a
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   giant wad of cash.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.520]   So I definitely do that or I'll pay for the airport transfer that should have been
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.600]   included in my hotel bill.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.880]   I'll pay for that in cash or whatever it is to basically help burn that last little
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:50.240]   bit off.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.120]   Worst case scenario, you bring home a few bucks and you exchange it at the airport
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:57.120]   in that country before you leave.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.400]   I never like to bring it home to the States because you're just going to get
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:00.800]   screwed.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.440]   They're just going to, once you land and step foot in the States, they know your
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.640]   money that you have in your pocket is worthless to you.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.120]   So they're just going to turn the screws on you.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.600]   And that's, we never want that.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.560]   And when you're checking out at the hotel and you're finally putting the rest of
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.440]   that hotel on your credit card, please do not choose to be billed in US dollars.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.160]   Oh God, no.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.880]   This whole dynamic currency conversion scam is the worst.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.200]   Basically what it is, is this.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.840]   Banks have gotten really intelligent about how to extract every dollar possible from
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.160]   people.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.640]   And so now you need a hack back.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:34.360]   That's the purpose of this show is like banks and credit card companies and
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.560]   airlines and hotels.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.680]   Like I love them.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.880]   I want great experiences, but I also want to find every chance to get the best
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.080]   experience at the best price.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.360]   And you don't want to feel like you've been taken for a ride.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:49.520]   And so what, what hotels or what credit card companies, banks are doing is they're
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:54.400]   actually asking you to pay in a Thai hotel in US dollars.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.600]   And that doesn't make any sense.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.000]   When you're in Thailand, you should be using Thai bot.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.680]   So when you're actually presented with a credit card terminal, it's going to say
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.280]   press one for Thai bot or press two for US dollars.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.080]   And you might think, geez, US dollars, how easy is that?
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080]   There's two things wrong here.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.720]   One, it's called dynamic currency conversion.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:15.640]   It's a scheme the banks use to basically charge you an inflated interest rate that
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.720]   you're getting screwed on.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.320]   Okay.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:22.160]   And number two, your bank may still charge you a foreign transaction fee if they do
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.400]   so on the US dollar transaction, because it's coming from Thailand.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.640]   So you could be paying twice.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.000]   Once on an overly inflated rate that might be something like 10 or 12% more than you
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.440]   need to be paying and two on a foreign exchange rate, which is a foreign exchange
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.600]   fee, which is the worst.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.320]   So take a credit card, pay in Thai bot and make sure it's a card that has no foreign
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.120]   transaction fees.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:42.560]   Exactly.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.760]   There's so many cards these days that have no foreign transaction fees.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.560]   So make sure that's the case.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   And while you're at it, make sure to tell the credit card company you're traveling,
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.520]   because there is nothing worse than showing up in a country and trying to use your
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.080]   credit card or your ATM card, having it not work, having to figure out how you can
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.280]   make that $25 phone call back to the US to get your card enabled.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.600]   So make sure you give them a heads up so you don't have any problems.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.120]   Speaking of phone calls, one of the hacks I love is trying to get a local SIM card.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:16.320]   In some countries, this is really hard and you've basically got to go give an ID and
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.640]   you've got to put a lot of money down.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.360]   And in some countries, a lot of African countries, it's give a dollar and you get
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.240]   a SIM card and you can sell them in the arrivals hall.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   And it's super easy.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.440]   But the hack here is if you have a phone that supports it, and I think starting with
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.240]   maybe the iPhone 11, it's always supported, you can actually have unlimited number of
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.040]   virtual SIM cards in addition to your one SIM card you put in the phone.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:41.400]   And so call Verizon, go on Verizon's website.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.560]   Google Fi does this.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.960]   A lot of carriers do now.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.280]   Convert your Verizon SIM card to an eSIM.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:52.440]   Now you have your SIM card free, so when you're overseas, you can still have your
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:57.120]   phone on your home carrier, but you can get a local SIM card, put it in and say,
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:01.920]   "Use my data on this new SIM card," and then you don't have to worry about pulling
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.600]   out your Verizon card, losing it, not being able to take an emergency phone call, but
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.400]   you can actually get local, cheaper data in that country.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:14.080]   If you don't have that, a lot of countries now rent out those little like portable
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:14.720]   hotspots.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.560]   Yeah, little MiFis.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.400]   That one's great because then you can use it with the whole family.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.160]   You just have to charge it every day and carry a second device.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:26.280]   Any other kind of data phone call hacks when you're traveling?
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:31.120]   So I always like to download the Google Maps offline version of the city that I'm
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.920]   going to make sure that I have all of the maps ahead of time because, look, Google
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.120]   Maps can just eat your data up when you're traveling abroad and you need it when
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.800]   you're traveling abroad.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.000]   So because of that, I always download ahead of time.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.560]   I also will use Google Translate as often as possible, and I'll actually screenshot,
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.840]   especially when it's some of the Asian languages that are not written in
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.680]   traditional Roman letters.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.440]   I'll screenshot some of this traditional phrases and like flashcards, study them on
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:00.080]   the plane so that I don't have to be using Google Translate consistently when I'm
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.600]   overseas.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.200]   But you can download Google Translate offline also, which is pretty good for me.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   If I'm looking at a Chinese menu in China, I don't understand it, but you can go with
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:13.440]   Google Translate and you could take a photo and they will in real time translate a
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:17.000]   photo of a sign in the subway of a menu.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.160]   It's so cool.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.000]   It is so cool.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.000]   So those two tools I can't live without ahead of time, but I think that the biggest
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.320]   thing that you can do on the data side is check with your carrier here in the States
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.400]   and say, does it make sense for me to be spending 10 bucks a day in Europe or can I
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:36.360]   buy like a European plan for a month where it's 99 bucks or $125 or whatever it is?
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.320]   Check to see if your carrier will offer that.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.520]   If you're on the road for a long time, those $10 a day charges, especially for a
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.160]   family of four, can really add up.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.280]   Yeah, it's worth considering if you're starting to travel a lot.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:53.000]   Google Fi, T-Mobile, some carriers have international coverage all around the world
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:53.560]   with data.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.960]   Yeah, totally free.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.440]   So I had a Google Fi SIM for a while.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:01.680]   It's one of the rare cases where I'd say it's so much better experience with Android
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.320]   than it is with iOS, which is a bummer as an iPhone user.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.280]   But it's great for international data.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:10.760]   And if you travel a lot, it could be worth having that as just a separate backup.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:15.840]   Yep. I know you could probably get a couple gigs of data on T-Mobile or Google Fi for
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.760]   20, 30 bucks a month, which if you're making a trip every two or three months, it
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.600]   makes total sense. It could make total sense.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.040]   Let me also switch gears for a quick sec and just talk about where you don't want to
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.840]   bring your phone. And that is to places where this might not be safe to have your own
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.040]   iPhone or smartphone.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:35.400]   So maybe you do have a backup burner phone that you can use that you can wipe clean
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.600]   quickly if you need to when you're traveling to sensitive countries.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.000]   Definitely have advised clients who travel overseas to do that, and they've definitely
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.480]   had instances where they've needed to do that.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.240]   So just bring a backup phone or have a backup phone just in case.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:51.400]   And if you're traveling to a country where privacy laws and human rights are
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:55.680]   challenging, like be careful, like maybe don't bring the computer that has your entire
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.040]   life stored on it. Maybe don't bring the computer that has a Word doc on your desktop
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.440]   with every password to every site and definitely don't carry that around town.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.920]   So we got to the country, we stayed, we figured out the way to hack everything local.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.000]   This was amazing.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.400]   Now I'm a little disappointed because I just want to go on more trips.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.040]   I feel like hopefully 2021 can shape up to be a year where we can go places.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.440]   You have any trips planned?
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:23.600]   So I just got back recently from Turks and Caicos, which was just bananas.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.720]   It was just so beautiful.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.000]   And the beaches are incredible.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.640]   And I can't recommend that destination enough.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   So beautiful. My next trip was supposed to be to Italy this summer.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.720]   Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen work challenges, I think I'll probably have to
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.680]   reschedule that one for later in the year.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.400]   But we do have New York on the docket.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.120]   A lot of other domestic travel coming up.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.120]   Traveling with little kids during the pandemic has been tricky.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.440]   And as you know, vaccinated travelers can now travel overseas fairly easily.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.880]   But if you're under 16 and not vaccinated, there's a big gray area.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:56.240]   So it should be interesting the next couple of months to see how that unfolds and how
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.000]   we take care of our little ones on the road.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.200]   Yeah. Wow.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.960]   I didn't even think about that as someone traveling with a nine month old, but she'll
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.920]   be fine. But you mentioned your slam with work.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.600]   Can you tell us a little bit more about Savanti?
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.120]   Yeah. So we're full service travel management for busy executives.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.880]   What that means is we handle people's travel just like an accountant would handle
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.080]   their money or a lawyer would handle their legal affairs.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.000]   So we're really on somebody's team.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.320]   So we're not right for everybody in the sense that we don't do any one off trips or
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.520]   plan a single vacation or honeymoon.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.440]   Instead, we get to really know our clients and really operate as an extension of their
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:33.080]   team so that we help them with everything from Southwest tickets to private jets or
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.880]   a holiday in express stay or a private yacht or a villa, everything in between.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:43.040]   But what we've done over the past few years is built up an extensive collection of
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:47.760]   really good relationships in the travel business that allow us to hack our way for
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.720]   our clients into experiences that they themselves couldn't get on their own.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:56.280]   So it's been really wonderful, incredibly gratifying to see this business blossom
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.240]   over the past five years to learn so much.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.720]   Oh, my God, there's so much more to learn.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.800]   But every day is a new adventure and is really fun.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.600]   And it's been great to see our clients come out of the sort of pandemic with a
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.320]   renewed sense of excitement around all the destinations that they can't wait to get
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.640]   to. We can't wait to help them get there.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.120]   That's awesome. Yeah. If you're listening and you have other questions, hacks, ideas,
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.600]   send them in to our email on all the hacks dot com.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.640]   Maybe we'll bring Lee back again and handle a bunch of questions from listeners.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.440]   Where can people find you online?
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.560]   So on Twitter at Lee Rowan or at Savanti Travel dot com.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.480]   Chris, thank you so much for having me.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.600]   This is great to chat, travel.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.840]   It's great to see you. It's great to be doing this in person again and actually seeing
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   another human for the first time in so long.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.320]   But thank you for making this happen.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.960]   I really appreciate it. This is amazing.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.400]   I can't wait to get out there and travel, and I hope this helps a lot of people do the
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.400]   same. Likewise.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.400]   All right. That's it for this episode of All the Hacks.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.280]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.320]   I'm just getting started with this show.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.960]   So if you like what you heard, I'd really appreciate a rating in your podcast app or
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.880]   if you'll simply tell a friend about the show, that would be amazing.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.880]   And finally, if you want to find links to anything we discussed today or if you want
