[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.680]   Hey everybody.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins and welcome to All The Hacks.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.360]   I am so excited you're here.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.400]   This show is about upgrading your life, money, and travel all while
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.200]   spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.920]   And I started it because I'm a diehard optimizer on my own
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.800]   quest to find every hack there is.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.760]   I love doing all the research to get the best experience in life without
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.720]   the expensive price tag and then breaking it down to share with everyone.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.960]   Each episode, I'll talk with a new expert and dive into all their secret deals.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.760]   So today I'm talking to Lee Rowan about travel.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.240]   Not only has Lee been a travel hacker for years, but he also used to be the
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.520]   COO of The Points Guy and now runs his own travel company called Savanti, where
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.000]   he and his team help their clients take the most incredible vacations, whether
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.640]   that's optimizing points for free first-class flights around the world or
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.560]   finding the best deal for a villa on the Amalfi Coast.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.200]   In our chat, we'll walk through all the hacks you need to know to save money and
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.400]   have an incredible, authentic experience on your next trip.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.200]   Before we jump in, I just want to mention the All The Hacks newsletter.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.920]   It's the other place I'll be sharing all the cool stuff I'm learning
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.560]   about and the new hacks I find.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.040]   So if you're not already subscribed, you can head on over to
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.080]   allthehacks.com/email and get signed up.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.120]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.600]   Lee, thanks for being here.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.920]   My pleasure to be here.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.320]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.600]   I think this is the first podcast you've actually done in person this year.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.120]   Is that right?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.600]   Yep.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.520]   So it's always tricky to find the intersection of vaccinated person who
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.960]   lives nearby that also has all the hacks.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.440]   So thank you for being here and fitting all those criteria.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.320]   Why don't you tell a little bit of background of yourself and let people
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.960]   know how you got to do all this crazy travel stuff.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.320]   Sure.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'm here in the Bay Area and I've been in the Bay Area for almost 20 years as
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.560]   an entrepreneur, a startup guy, somebody who's bounced around between
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.840]   advertising and marketing and now finally travel.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.400]   And I came to this role accidentally.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.320]   So I call myself the accidental travel agent.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.680]   And that's because I was a traveler who really figured out how to hack my own
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.840]   travel for me, how to do it the right way, using the right credit cards and
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.320]   points and miles and loyalty games to sit in the best seats and the best
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.440]   aircraft to fly to the best airports with the best service.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.600]   And of course, the best part for me is to stay in the best hotels at the best
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.880]   available rates with the most perks and amenities, upgrades, all that stuff.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.640]   And so the way I really figured it out was by trial and error, by figuring out
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   which online content sources websites had the best news or the best credit
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.360]   card, mileage information, et cetera.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.640]   And I put together this sort of methodology around how to travel.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.360]   So long story short, I was at an ad agency and left that ad agency to go
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.080]   join the points guy.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.120]   After running that business for a year, I came back to the startup world and
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.920]   really did so because a lot of my friends who were running startups of their own
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.320]   requested me to manage travel for them like I was doing it for me.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.520]   And what that meant was understanding which credit cards they had,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.960]   understanding why they were traveling.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.120]   Was it for work or pleasure?
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.960]   Who was paying?
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.080]   What type of experience they wanted to have?
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.200]   So I set up Savanti Travel about five years ago.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.000]   And we do that now full time.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.840]   We're providing full service travel management to busy executives around the
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   Bay Area and around the world, helping them manage all of their travel.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   I thought it would be a great idea to do an episode on breaking down an entire
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.720]   trip, which is something that you guys have probably done for thousands of
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.040]   people, thousands of times.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.320]   And just start at the beginning.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.200]   Right now, I feel like everyone is in need of a vacation.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.080]   I don't know if you've gotten a chance to like explore and leave the Bay Area yet,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.640]   but I'm going to this week and I just I'm very excited.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.440]   The anticipation is real, isn't it?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.640]   That moment you step back on the plane your first time back, there's the sense
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.600]   of release and of relief, right?
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.920]   Because there's so much to be scared about, to be fearful of and the unknown
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.760]   of traveling right now.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.280]   And the reality is that travel is very safe right now, right?
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.080]   There's all those studies about planes and the HEPA filters and all that jazz.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.960]   We don't need to get into that.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.800]   But the reality is travel is safe.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.760]   And if you do it safely and do it correctly, you can have an amazing time.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   So when I think about travel planning right now, whether it's for corporate
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.000]   stuff on the Savanti side or it's for leisure, personal vacations, family
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.720]   trips, whatever, I really think about what's your mindset, right?
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.360]   Like the biggest hack for me is understanding after the trip, what do you
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.240]   want to look back on from that trip and say, this is what I'm trying to achieve
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.880]   with this trip while you're planning it.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.840]   So a great example for me when I'm planning a trip for someone is to actually
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.000]   ask them that question to say, hey, listen, you're back from the trip.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.640]   What did you post on Instagram?
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.680]   What's your social media posts look like?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.960]   What's your memento from that trip that you're like so happy you have
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.840]   because you're so grateful you did it?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.880]   And let's start there and let's work backwards.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.840]   And do people always have an answer or do you have to coach them to get an answer?
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.680]   Some people are like laser focused.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.480]   I'm going back to Italy to sit in my favorite cafe to sip a cappuccino while I
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.600]   watch the pigeons in the square.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.080]   That's their thing and they're going to achieve it.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.600]   And that's great.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.680]   Some people really like they're, they're taking it back by that question.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.200]   They're like, what am I trying to solve for here?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   And so each level of travel planning, I like to break down to what am I
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.160]   trying to solve for here?
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.520]   And if I know what we're trying to solve for with each element of the trip, then
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.600]   we can knock this thing out of the park.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.680]   For me, I feel like maybe I'm just a bit too optimized, but I always start with a
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.680]   really high level goal.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   So it's, I want to go to a beach.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.200]   So in this cup coming trip, I just want to go somewhere warm where I can go to a
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.640]   hotel and sit outside and order good food and relax.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.920]   And the challenge is I didn't actually care where.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.240]   Right.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.080]   And so it was really tough for me because there's probably, I don't know, 15 places
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.440]   you could go where it's warm, where there's a nice resort could be Hawaii, could be
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.880]   Mexico, could be Central America, could be the Caribbean.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.960]   And so my biggest challenge is there's an unlimited number of options and I really
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.000]   wanted to focus on price.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.640]   So if I could go to any of those places and one of them was half the cost, I, I
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.560]   wouldn't even really care.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.080]   So, you know, my strategy was if I don't know exactly what I want, it's, is there a
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.840]   place that is like much cheaper than everywhere else?
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.640]   I do that with Google flights destinations.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.320]   You go and you say, I'm in San Francisco.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.840]   I want to go somewhere nonstop.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.080]   We have a nine month old, there's no changing planes.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.160]   And I'm just like browsing around.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.880]   I was like, okay, so Cabo's this much, Cancun this much, Costa Rica's this much.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.760]   Hawaii is a little bit more expensive.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.600]   And so that's how I ended up saying I'm willing to go anywhere that's warm, but I
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.160]   just want to figure out when it's cheapest.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.240]   And you could even say.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.280]   Anytime in the next six months and get an idea of the best dates.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.400]   And it's pretty flexible in searching for that.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.800]   Is that advice you give people?
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.000]   Or?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.360]   Sure.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.800]   Of course, because that's what we know you're trying to sell for, right?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.120]   You know that price is the motivating factor next to warmth, right?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.200]   So assuming warmth, assuming seasonality, assuming now price, now we have to look at
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.520]   how you're going to pay for those tickets.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.160]   If you've got cash, Google flights is fantastic.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.800]   It'll tell you exactly the cheapest airfare you want to find for the markets you want
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.120]   to find it for based on the dates you have, et cetera.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.600]   It's great.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.960]   And if you use the explore functionality there, it's really incredible.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.880]   There's also a bunch of mileage opportunities, right?
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.200]   And so it depends on what your digital assets are, your mileage, your
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.680]   points that you could use.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.640]   There are some search engines that are really good for that.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.360]   One of them is called juicy miles.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.480]   It's a $30 a month subscription.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   If you're really into points and miles, it's great because you can plug in your
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.920]   routing.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.520]   You can take a look at the different credit cards or the different other mileage
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.440]   programs that are there.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.760]   And you can look at how you can pay for those tickets.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.280]   And when you compare those tickets on the mileage side versus what Google
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.480]   flights is charging, you can see side by side sort of what makes sense.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.600]   What's the good comparison, which asset to use one.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.680]   So we have another episode about miles and credit cards and points.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.160]   And I also made a guide to my top cards and the best signup bonuses right now at
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.960]   all the hacks.com/cards.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.360]   So we won't go deep, but is there a just quick rule of thumb you use if you're
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.320]   looking at a flight on United and it's X dollars and Y miles?
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.400]   Is there a quick way that you make a decision of whether the miles are maybe a
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.000]   good idea?
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   Yeah, I want to get two cents per mile.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   So what that means is if I'm looking at a thousand dollar airline ticket, if it's
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.600]   basically 50,000 miles or fewer, great deal.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   If it's 64,000 miles, it's a terrible deal.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.240]   And very often right now with a lot of the airlines, they're doing variable
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.680]   pricing.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.800]   So it used to be a set price for a set destination or set of destinations.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.080]   It's no longer that way.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.680]   So you really do have to check, log into your account, take a look at what mileage
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.080]   you have.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.440]   Take a look at what the airline is trying to charge on their publicly available
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.200]   website and figure out what the good deal is.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.040]   By the way, at the end of the day, you're not getting two cents of value per mile.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.160]   Who cares if you feel like you're getting value out of it?
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.600]   Great.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   That's what matters in the end.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.960]   Sometimes it's cash flow, right?
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.080]   Like I want to take a vacation.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.360]   I don't have the cash right now.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.560]   Use the miles.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.360]   I never look back.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.080]   Anything that gets you the vacation.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.200]   Okay.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.960]   So let's say we're not using miles.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.480]   Does it matter where you buy flights?
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.120]   Can you just buy them on Google flights?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.600]   Do you buy them on the airline website?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.360]   Great question.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.720]   So in today's day and age, this would have been a whole different
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.400]   conversation a year ago, pre COVID.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.440]   But in today's day and age, cancellation and flexibility are the things that
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.920]   matter the most when you're booking travel.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.520]   And so what really matters there is booking directly with the airline and
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   understanding their cancellation policy when you're booking, because that's the
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.280]   policy that you're going to be bound by with those funds that you're
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.240]   using to buy that ticket.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.960]   Now, if you're booking through a third party, let's say Expedia or Travelocity
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.720]   or any of these other online travel agencies, you're fraught with peril.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.480]   If you do that, you're running into an intermediary that's between you and the
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.240]   airline that could really stop up the release of or the change of your ticket.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.680]   So I really caution highly against that.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.960]   Now I'm a little biased because I'm technically a travel advisor in
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.240]   the travel agency community.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.200]   Booking with a travel advisor often makes a lot of sense because travel advisors
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.160]   will have access to special rates, things that are unpublished net rates.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.720]   For instance,
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.760]   These are on flights.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.520]   These are on flights.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.080]   Correct.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.440]   And so you
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.720]   specific kinds of flights.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.520]   Usually it's international business, but sometimes even domestically, there are
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.120]   with some economy fairs, even there are unpublished corporate rates available
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   that travel agencies can tap into.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.920]   So it does actually pay to ask if you have a travel advisor, what rate you could get
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.760]   on a particular flight, especially if it's an expensive one, right?
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.480]   I can't exactly quote things off the top of my head, but let's just say a
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.080]   transcontinental flight from San Francisco to New York would cost $240 one way in
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.520]   economy.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.360]   There's a good chance that there's a corporate rate available and that might
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   be $179.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.640]   That's a meaningful savings if you're doing that a few times a year or for a
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.600]   few people on the same flight.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.360]   And are there specific travel advisors that offer these kind of discounted
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.080]   fares or do you just have to kind of
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.960]   Best to ask around?
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.240]   They tend to be the ones that work with the higher end agencies.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.280]   So you could look at the virtuoso.com website, which is a collection of about,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   I think 20,000 travel advisors globally, and see if any of those have the
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.720]   particular fares you're looking for.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.200]   Do you all remember episode 122, where I spoke with chef David Chang about
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.960]   leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.800]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.720]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.840]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.240]   cookware from Anyday, I am a total convert and I am so excited to be
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.840]   partnering with them for this episode.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.800]   Anyday is glass cookware, specially designed to make delicious food
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.640]   from scratch in the microwave.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.920]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.640]   up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.080]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.720]   store, and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.680]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.920]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang to launch the beautiful
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.480]   matte black IO collection, so you should definitely check that out.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:17.240]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.320]   or use the code HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.960]   This holiday season, I want to give gifts to my loved ones that make them
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.520]   feel special and unique, just like the relationships we share.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.200]   If you feel the same way, you should be giving them StoryWorth, which is an
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.800]   incredible gift I've given to the people I care about, and I'm excited
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.000]   to be partnering with them today.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.880]   StoryWorth is an online service that helps you and your loved ones preserve
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.680]   precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.000]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.640]   Each week, StoryWorth emails your relative or friend a thought-provoking
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.800]   question of your choice from a vast pool of options.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.480]   Each unique prompt asks a question you've never thought about, like
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.560]   what's the bravest thing you've ever done, or if you could see into the
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.520]   future, what would you want to find out?
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.440]   After a year, StoryWorth will compile all your loved ones' stories, including
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.720]   photos, into a beautiful keepsake book that you'll be able to share and revisit
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.000]   for generations to come, which now that we have kids, I couldn't be more excited
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.040]   to start collecting these books to share with them.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.600]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you with loved ones no matter how near
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   or far apart you are, and you'll be surprised at the things you learn, like
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.640]   how my dad might have gotten into trouble for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.040]   back when he was in the military.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.520]   With StoryWorth, I'm giving those I love most a thoughtful, personal gift from
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.040]   the heart and preserving their memories and stories for years to come.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.720]   Go to allthehacks.com/storyworth to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:15:00.320]   That's allthehacks.com/storyworth to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.840]   Any tips on picking the flight?
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.320]   You know, when you're going to New York, there's seven airlines.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.920]   If you have a loyalty program and you live in San Francisco and you've
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.520]   decided I'm all in on United, it's an easy choice, but if you're sometimes
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.800]   taking an international trip or if you're going somewhere you don't fly
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.960]   often and you could fly any airline, is there any quick, easy way?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.000]   I mean, you probably know this off the top of your head.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.600]   Which airline you want to fly?
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.840]   Who's got the best seats?
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.440]   Is there any hacks to figure out the best one?
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.840]   So unfortunately, the answer is not that easy because it's a lot
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.720]   of amassed knowledge over time.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.160]   And if you even do look at United, going back to New York for a second,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.880]   they fly into their hub of Newark from San Francisco, but now they also fly
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.600]   into JFK and they're flying different aircraft to those different destinations.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.200]   So if you're sitting up in business, there's actually quite a difference
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.120]   between a one-two-one seating in business on a triple seven or on a seven-eight-seven
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   Dreamliner versus the old school two-four-two seating in business on a
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.840]   triple seven for United going into Newark.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.760]   So it really does pay to actually go onto their website, study the seat
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.920]   map of where you're going to be sitting, and then take a look at reviews.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.160]   Look at online on Seek Guru or any of the review websites to actually find out,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.520]   okay, what's this experience like?
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.040]   By the way, what is this experience like during COVID?
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.440]   Am I going on a five and a half hour flight and they're not serving food?
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.720]   Like, that's going to suck.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.040]   So make sure you plan ahead and you buy food at the airport and you bring water
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.160]   and all of these things you might need for the plane.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.960]   I definitely think that if COVID has taught us anything, it's that everything
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.520]   you knew about travel has completely changed and it's now time to re-research
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.640]   even the stuff that you were super familiar with.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.600]   So feel free to ask people online, reach out to the airline itself, though,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.000]   expect long hold times, maybe Twitter's better for that one, but do expect that
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.760]   you've got to do a little bit of research before you get back on the road and make
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.600]   sure you're getting the right experience you want to have.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   Awesome.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.400]   So when it comes to flight deals, I haven't actually ever tried this, but I
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.080]   was walking through Costco the other day and there's this big banner for like
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.720]   Costco, we plan your vacation, we have flights and hotels.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.320]   Is that ever a good deal?
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.760]   No.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.440]   So here's the thing, Costco has its great upsides, rental cars, for instance,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.840]   incredible rates and deals.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.560]   They have 20 ish percent discount off of publicly available rates.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.520]   You're going to rent a car and you want to use your Costco account.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.440]   Totally do it.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.080]   It's a great idea.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.000]   Also, all of their car rentals are fully refundable.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.240]   So you could even rent three or four from different car rental agencies and you
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.880]   could easily refund them if you need to.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.640]   Not a problem.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.920]   Great, great to use them there.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.000]   However, if you do use Costco, I highly recommend if you're going to work with
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.360]   them on the rental car basis, that you actually reconfirm your rental before
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.880]   you rent it, before you pick it up.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.760]   So we usually will call for on behalf of our clients, we'll call a day or two in
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.840]   advance of their arrival and say, Hey, FYI, Chris has come into town.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.920]   He rented through Costco.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.240]   Just want to reconfirm everything is up to snuff with his rental so that you,
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.560]   Chris, when you get there, I don't have any problems or surprises.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.240]   And during COVID, I've seen so many stories lately of rental car
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.080]   companies running out of cars, people renting U-Hauls to drive around Hawaii.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.920]   So this is a great hack.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   Um, I was just in the New York times talking with them about this exact thing.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.040]   It used to be that when you booked a hotel, you'd call the hotel and sort of
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.960]   work with them, but you would never call a rental car.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.440]   Now you're actually doing that more.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.400]   You're calling the branch office at the airport that you're going to, not the
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.160]   800 number for Hertz, but the actual branch office and saying to them, Hey,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.800]   I'm Chris, I'm going to be arriving this date on this time, this flight.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.880]   Please make sure that my vehicle will be there.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.720]   And they will note it.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.040]   I'll even go so far as to ask the name of the person who will be there at the front
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.640]   desk, because when I check into that counter, if I'm going to the counter, I
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.520]   want to make sure that they know who I am and that they've flagged my vehicle as a
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.400]   VIP vehicle and it works.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.400]   We did it in Hawaii a couple of weeks ago and it was great.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.560]   And it's not VIP that you're someone special.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.040]   It's just, you took the time to call.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.440]   Correct.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   That I actually have a vehicle there.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.560]   They didn't give away to somebody else.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.360]   Now you asked about Costco and booking flights.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.840]   The answer I think really is no.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.320]   Right.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.040]   Costco is not a good channel to book flights and nor is Expedia or Travelocity,
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.600]   like I said earlier, because you're adding an extra intermediary between you and the
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:57.960]   airline.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.760]   Now, when you're bundling things together, there is a different option.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.800]   What a bundle is you buy, let's say a flight and a hotel together.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.560]   And actually for this, I would go directly to the airline.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.600]   Pretty much every major domestic airline has what they call a vacation website.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.360]   Doesn't mean you need to use it for only vacations.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.680]   I may have used it a couple of times to hack a business trip together for somebody.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.600]   But basically you can book a hotel and an airline flight bundled together at often a
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.120]   lot cheaper than what you would see online for those two separate components.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.760]   And the way you do this is you either book a hotel you're going to use or you maybe
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.520]   you book a hotel you won't use, throw away hotel and bundle it with the flights you
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:35.800]   want.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.080]   Good example of this.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.720]   LA to London can often be seven, eight, $10,000 round trip in business.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:47.680]   But if you book it on the American Airlines website and you throw in a hotel, you can
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.120]   actually get that seven or eight or $10,000 flight down to even five or $6,000
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.360]   simply by adding in the hotel.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.960]   And why that matters is that you're getting an unpublished sort of special fare that
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   the airline would never market on its own, but they will market it in conjunction with
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.360]   a hotel.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.000]   Could I just pick a one star hotel and bundle it?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.320]   Not going to say I've done it a lot of times, but maybe I have.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.360]   Absolutely.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.000]   Amazing.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.240]   So no Costco, yes, airline vacation websites.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.800]   Exactly.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.720]   Any other flight hacks?
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.520]   I think the best thing about flights is to understand in this post-COVID world how
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.680]   flexible they can be.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.920]   And so points and miles really offer a ton of flexibility because even pre-COVID, the
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.240]   worst case scenario with them, you had a $250 change and redeposit fee, which was a
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.360]   lot cheaper than the standard published fare of $400 to change your ticket.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.920]   But nowadays, if you understand what you can do with change and cancellation, you can
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.800]   actually hedge.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.280]   You can buy a bunch of cheap flights and hold on to them and maybe never use them, but
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.520]   at least revolve them into your next cheap flight.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.480]   It's free to change now.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.400]   It's free to cancel.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.440]   Unless you have a basic economy fare, which I saw this morning.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:03.200]   All the domestic airlines except one, it was probably maybe JetBlue, basic economy fares
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.640]   have lost their flexibility.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.000]   Correct.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.120]   If you're taking a flight and you don't care about any of the perks, basic economy may
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:09.760]   work for you.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.240]   Maybe.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:10.960]   Maybe.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.600]   Last minute.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.120]   But I would say always make sure when you're looking on Google flights that you add in a
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.000]   carry on as something you're bringing and you'll notice the fares go up because some of
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.280]   those super cheap flights are basic economy and they're now at the point where if you
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.320]   can't take the flight, there's no refund.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.800]   There's no changing anything.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.400]   So be extra careful with basic economy flights from now forward.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.000]   Cool.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.640]   OK, so flights, we've got flights figured out.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.760]   I actually think that the hotel can make the vacation more than the flight.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.520]   I've had my fair share of flights that were incredible, but the hotel seems to always
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.000]   be what lands everything.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.320]   How do you even begin to start thinking about finding a hotel?
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.240]   My biggest challenge, and I wish I had an answer, is when I'm going to a place, I'm
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.640]   just totally overwhelmed.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.120]   There's so many places you can stay.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.320]   Everything seems to be four to four and a half stars on TripAdvisor.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   Right.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.960]   How do you start to narrow down the scope of all the hotels you can stay at?
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.400]   So this is a great question and one that is not easily answerable.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.000]   But my simple answer is this.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.280]   Ask people.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.200]   Ask someone who's been at the destination.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.320]   Ask a travel advisor.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.960]   Ask people on social media.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.360]   Search for hotels in social media.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.040]   Actually, take a look at what Instagram photos people are posting or what reviews
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.720]   they're posting on Twitter, even on Facebook.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.400]   A lot of this content is public and it's not available in the TripAdvisor channel,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.800]   which, again, like you, I think is pretty biased.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.440]   You're either writing a five star review or one star review.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.080]   It doesn't really give you a ton of insight.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.960]   So take a look around at other places online to get good destination advice,
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.560]   but especially ask your friends with good taste or ask people you might know
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.960]   who recently been to the destination for their advice.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.960]   But I think that the key thing is once you settle in on one or two hotels,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.160]   really understand from their website, what are they offering?
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.040]   What are the amenities?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.480]   What's closed during COVID?
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.760]   What can you expect when you check in?
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.280]   What are the rooms looking like?
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.720]   Is my partial ocean view really of a parking lot?
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.480]   And there's a sliver of an ocean back there.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.920]   Partial ocean view seems like the biggest.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.400]   I feel like I stayed at the Fairmont in Hawaii and I was like,
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.840]   I'm supposed to have a partial ocean view.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.760]   And they're like, can you see the ocean if you lean over the balcony?
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.480]   That's what I was like.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.120]   Yeah, the lanai overlooking the garden that's been covered in greenery.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.240]   It's not ocean.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.320]   But really, if you look around online, you'll find the right resources.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.520]   But then there's the question of how do you book it?
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.680]   And I think this is another great example of book direct and book with knowledge.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.160]   You do not want to go through an intermediary here.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.440]   That's not adding any value. Right.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.320]   You and I chatted recently about TripAdvisor Pro or TripAdvisor Plus
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.680]   or whatever this new thing is that they're putting out.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.960]   And it's an interesting take.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.720]   What it is, it's ninety nine bucks a year and it will theoretically get you
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.200]   cheaper access to the same hotel rooms that you'd see online.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.840]   You don't get benefits and amenities.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.160]   You just get a cheaper price.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.040]   I know anyone thinking about, do I want to spend ninety nine dollars
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.400]   to get a better rate?
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.120]   Is it actually going to be cheaper?
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.280]   No. The net answer is, yeah, sure it is.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   To your credit card, it'll be cheaper, but the experience will also be cheaper.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   And so therefore you really don't want to do it.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.280]   OK, here's why.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.520]   What TripAdvisor is doing with their pro or plus whatever it is thing is
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.720]   they're basically rebating back to you some of their corporate
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.920]   negotiated contract rates.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.120]   So let's say the room is five hundred bucks online, right?
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.560]   It's an expensive room.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.120]   They're going to give you that room for four sixty five.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.360]   And why are they doing that?
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.720]   Because on the back end, they're probably getting whatever, 10 percent off
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.800]   when they market that room as commission or a rebate from the hotel.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.120]   And so they're giving you a portion of that to basically offset the cost.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.040]   Now, that's great.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.680]   But if you actually went to the hotel and you paid five hundred dollars
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.960]   for that room, you'd probably be getting free breakfast.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.080]   What's the value of that?
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.560]   Is it more than thirty five bucks?
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.760]   Probably. Or if you go through a travel advisor or your credit card,
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.200]   you may be getting free breakfast and a hundred dollar credit.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.480]   Well, a hundred bucks is clearly more than thirty five.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.760]   So I think what's a really good takeaway here is understand the channel
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.880]   through which you book, because the channel matters the most
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.040]   when it comes to hotels.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   If you can't book it directly for some reason, find a way to book it.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.960]   It's going to get you the best value.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.240]   It might be through a travel advisor.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.720]   It might be through your credit card.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.400]   Might be through like a perk at your company or your office
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.080]   where they have a weird travel portal you've never been to.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.600]   Like, look at that.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.760]   But find the best value for your booking and book.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.040]   And so booking from the hotel, number one choice.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.720]   What's the experience going to be like if I book from the hotel's website
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.960]   versus Expedia?
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.040]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.440]   So in the hotel biz, it's all about relationships.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.800]   What they're looking to do is build a relationship with every guest
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.720]   that comes through that door
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.040]   to make sure that guest will keep coming back over and over again.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.840]   And so when you book directly with the hotel,
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.320]   they have the most amount of information on you as a guest
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.600]   as they can possibly have.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.720]   You book through third party, you book through Expedia
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.120]   or even American Express Travel, which is ironic.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.640]   You come through as Expedia guest in their system
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.960]   that doesn't exactly give them the information they want to know.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   They want to know who you are, why you're traveling.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.440]   Is this business or leisure?
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.480]   You're celebrating something.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.400]   When are you arriving? When are you departing?
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.120]   All of these things matter to them because they can customize your stay
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.160]   in a way that when you book through a third party
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.000]   and none of that information is given, that they can't. Right.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.480]   So the more info you can give to the hotel, the better.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.840]   And the best way of doing that, honestly, is booking direct
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.840]   and then following up with the hotel with an email to say, hey, I'm Chris.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.960]   I just booked directly on your website.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.000]   This is the room I booked.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   These are the dates I'm staying.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.480]   This is the confirmation number.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.240]   I'd love you to know this about me and share whatever you want to share.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.840]   Oftentimes, we, on behalf of our clients, will share social media profiles.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.280]   We'll share where they're coming from on their trip.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.720]   Maybe this is stop one of a five stop trip.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.640]   Maybe they're just coming away for a quick getaway for the weekend.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.440]   Maybe it's just two people staying for the first two nights
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.160]   and then they're joined by the third by the on the third night.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.640]   Whatever it is, we're sharing that level of detail.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.040]   This person likes fish.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.600]   They don't like chicken, whatever.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.960]   And the importance there is that they're going to make sure
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.680]   the hotel is going to make sure that they take this data into account
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.840]   and they've really customized the stay to that guest's needs.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.040]   So I don't ever hesitate to send a note to a hotelier and say, hey,
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.360]   this is a really important person to me and here's who they are and here's why.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.000]   And then right before the stay, follow up with them again.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.360]   Hey, Chris is coming to town.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.720]   Please dial him in.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.760]   These are the things that matter.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.160]   But I can do this myself if I don't have a travel agent.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.800]   I could just call and say, or how do I even get the email?
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.920]   Email. So I think emails best because it's in writing, number one.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.360]   And number two, it allows you to go back to that same email and add to it
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.280]   because you will never forget something.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.440]   But the best thing to do is to find the email for either the concierge
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.480]   or the reservations team at that hotel.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   When you book online through the website, you'll usually be given an email
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.040]   with a confirmation that actually has that information in it.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.360]   And I might even have the GM or the director of sales or somebody's name.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   We can't wait to welcome you, Chris.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.680]   So I'm John Hopkins.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.800]   You're going to email John Hopkins and let him know you're coming.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.840]   And then John and his team will take care of you.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.560]   And if you don't get an email, is there any like secret to the website
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.400]   or can I just call them and ask them for the email?
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.360]   Call them. In fact, call them, get to the front desk and ask somebody
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.320]   at the front desk and say, hey, listen, who can email and say who I am
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.960]   or who can email in advance of my stay?
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.800]   Just so you guys have a little more information on me and what we're looking to do.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.520]   And is that the concierge? Who is that?
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.920]   They'll direct you to the right person.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.080]   But I highly recommend writing that email because it's going to give a level of depth
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.400]   that the hotel wouldn't have otherwise.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.960]   And it's the best way of hacking your way to an upgrade
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.000]   or hacking your way to a better experience.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.200]   I'm going to Mexico next week.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.600]   Yeah. I email the front desk and say, hey, I'm coming.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.320]   I'm really excited to stay with you.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.800]   Do you really think that's going to improve the chances I get upgraded?
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.960]   Totally. Because what you're going to do is you're going to say, I'm coming with my wife.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.120]   This is our first trip.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.320]   Also, I'm with a nine month old.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.440]   Can you please confirm that there's a crib in the room?
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.600]   We're arriving at this time.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.080]   Will the room be ready when we arrive?
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.160]   All of these questions you're asking are questions they want to know
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.200]   that they want to actually have asked to them.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.760]   If you just show up and be like, where's my crib?
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.840]   Didn't you see I have a nine month old?
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.720]   Like they're totally caught off guard.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.920]   So they're going to be able to prepare for you in advance.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.280]   And they're going to flag you a little star on their morning check in list.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.160]   And they're going to say, OK, this guy's already reached out.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.360]   We know who he is.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.400]   And that's going to give them so much more fodder to work with while you're there.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.720]   Look, it may be that they can't give you an upgrade because they're sold out.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.560]   Maybe they give you a welcome drink or an amenity or something else
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.440]   that you wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.000]   That's very possible.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.440]   You're probably also going to have a letter in your room
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.240]   from the GM being like, Chris, thanks for reaching out.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.160]   Thanks for trusting us with your stay.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.560]   Looking forward to making this special.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:19.880]   You know what?
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.680]   When you get in your room, email the GM, be like, I'm in the room.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.640]   It's great.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.440]   Like some more towels or whatever you need.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.160]   And then the GM will take you. Nice.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.320]   And I assume I'm not getting any of this if I book through Travelocity.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.800]   They're not going to know who you are.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.360]   They're not even going to know your name is Chris sometimes. Like seriously.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.040]   So that's the thing I think is most important to understand
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.440]   is that travel and hotels in particular are all about relationships.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.200]   And so the more you can connect with your hotelier and your destination,
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.480]   the better your experience will be.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.960]   And that also means, by the way, that they'll unlock doors for you
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.280]   outside of the hotel in that city. Right.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   If you need restaurant recommendations or experiences,
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.640]   they're really a good gatekeeper to help you.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.040]   And I've always wondered, I've asked the concierge for restaurant recommendations.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.000]   And sometimes I feel like I always go and double check.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.520]   I look these restaurants up. Some hotels, they're great.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.920]   Sometimes I'm like, is this place that good?
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.720]   Can you trust the concierge? Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.600]   The first place they're always going to recommend is the hotel restaurant.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.000]   Right. Because that's the thing I do.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.640]   Then they're going to recommend their cousin's place
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.120]   or whoever's giving them a kickback.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.120]   But then down the line, there might be some other one.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   And I'm grossly overgeneralizing here.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.280]   I think concierges do incredible work and we'd be lost without them in a lot of ways.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.000]   But I do think you have to take their recommendations with a grain of salt.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.840]   Right. Not every concierge is amazing.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.720]   The Clef d'Or people who are really, truly spectacular,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.520]   they know their markets inside and out.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.360]   And I would listen to them and I'd email them in advance for a guide to the city.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.440]   Right. What can I do?
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.400]   And oftentimes they will be able to provide incredible levels of detail
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.040]   of what's open, what's not, what's happening, what's hot, all of that.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.320]   And that level of access.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.040]   So definitely leverage them.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.600]   Definitely take what they say with a grain of salt, but know that
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.160]   you can get fantastic access from concierges that you may not be able to get yourself.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.280]   Yeah. I've one time asked, can you give me a restaurant recommendation?
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.240]   I got an OK recommendation.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.760]   And then I was like, I'm going to be here five days.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.880]   Can you give me a few?
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.360]   And then I looked at number three, number four.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.760]   And they like they can't give you five cousins
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.800]   because they probably don't have five cousins.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.320]   But the third and fourth recommendations were good.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.920]   So that's hotels.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.840]   Sometimes you're just traveling with a big family.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.000]   Maybe you want to rent a house.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.200]   Maybe you want to rent a villa.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.720]   Maybe you want a different experience.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.640]   Airbnb, VRBO.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.080]   I noticed there's not a lot of comparison shopping, right?
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.800]   It's not like I can go to five sites and see if it's cheaper somewhere else.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.720]   Is there any hacks for trying to book a house or a villa somewhere?
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.920]   Yeah, there are a ton.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.080]   And boy, wouldn't it be great if you could come up with the comparison
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.520]   shopping engine for homes, home rentals?
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.840]   It would be incredible.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.400]   But yeah, the short answer is yes, there are.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.000]   What I like to do is search with a couple of different tabs open,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.200]   both for VRBO and Airbnb or HomeAway or other hyper localized sites.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.760]   And the way I've hacked it is oftentimes a lot of these vacation rental
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.040]   properties that are specifically for vacation rentals, right?
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   They're not like somebody's home.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.360]   They're just renting out on the side like we do here.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.080]   But they're actually vacation rentals.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:13.040]   They'll often have their own website that you can book directly on for that home.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.360]   And the way I find them is I go to Airbnb or VRBO.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.560]   I take a couple of the photos from their listings
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.080]   and I run a reverse Google image search.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.320]   So like a screenshot, the front of the house or the pool or something
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.680]   that's pretty like unique to that home.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.160]   And then I'll run it into images.google.com.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.880]   There's a little button you can click to actually upload a photo.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.800]   I'll reverse image search to see, OK, where else is this image listed?
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.440]   And inevitably, if they're listing it on VRBO or if they're listing it on HomeAway,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   it's going to show up on Google for their actual vacation rental website home address.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.760]   So I go to that address and I take a look at the rates and say, OK,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.120]   is it available here?
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.000]   Is it cheaper than I'm seeing on HomeAway or VRBO or Airbnb?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.600]   And if so, I just reach out directly through their own website,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.840]   contact the owner and do the contracting there.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.480]   Oftentimes that can save 10, 15, 20 percent on a home rental.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.440]   So we definitely recommend doing that.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.720]   Also, you get to then know the homeowner before you transact with them.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.760]   So you know if this person's like weird or if they're cool.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.480]   And that's really helpful, too.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.840]   So that's hotels, that's villas.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.960]   Now let's talk about just getting to a country.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.360]   So I'll start with one thing I love to do when I get in a country.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.400]   And I'd love to hear if you have any hacks for what to do,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.920]   what to see, how to figure it out.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.560]   But the first thing I always do, unless I'm going to just relax
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.520]   at a beach, is my wife and I book a food tour.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.040]   And there's a ton of sites online that have food tours.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.400]   Airbnb now has these local experiences.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.040]   And we'll just go on a three hour tour in the morning.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.640]   Usually go to a market in the middle of the city with someone local.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   You get to see how the market works, how people operate, how selling works.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.280]   But you also probably end up eating two or three things.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.840]   And you get to ask a thousand questions about the culture,
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.880]   about the city, learn new stuff.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.160]   That's like my way to get immersed just right away
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.360]   and really get a sense of what the country's like.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.080]   But that's my hack. I don't have anything else.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.200]   How do you figure out what to do? Is there anything you do?
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.440]   So there are two steps to this.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.480]   First is you want to plan way ahead of time what you're going to do.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.920]   But we'll get to that in a second.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.720]   Second is when you get there, what's the first thing you do?
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.680]   And I love the idea of a food tour, right?
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.920]   Because there's no better way of really understanding a market
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.120]   or understanding a new place you've ever been.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.880]   I think if you're not into doing a food tour,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.760]   it's a little too dicey for you right off the bat.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.240]   I think taking a walking tour with a guide is a great idea.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.400]   You can often find cheap or sometimes even free walking tours.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.000]   A lot of them leaving from your hotel, for instance,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.120]   to get to know your neighborhood or an area.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.840]   And that is a great way of not only getting out and working out that jet lag,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.440]   but also really getting to know how a city operates.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:51.000]   But let's step back and figure out, OK, we're going to a new place.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.120]   I've got no idea about the destination. What do I do?
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.080]   How do I plan this?
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.040]   First things first, always helps to ask around.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.280]   Who you know who's been there,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.440]   who on social media you follow who's recently been there.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.760]   Just get a taste of that
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.960]   so you can make sure you write down those things on your agenda.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.720]   Secondly, and this is a hack you showed me, actually, go to your local library.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.840]   Take a look at what guidebooks are available for that area.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.480]   I mean, guidebooks, Lonely Planet,
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.280]   it sounds like it's like an old school 1977 thing.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.720]   It's so valuable.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.280]   Every trip we take, I go look and you don't even have to buy the book for this,
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:19.720]   by the way.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   I go to Amazon and I search for the Lonely Planet.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.840]   And the first five pages are like top 25 experiences in this country.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.360]   And I try not to go too micro.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.960]   So I might look at the country guide instead of the city guide.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.440]   Because the country guide might only have two or three things in a major city.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.920]   And I don't want to know the 20 things.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.800]   I want to know the two or three things. Right.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.480]   But the hack that's awesome is there's this Chrome extension.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.240]   I think it works on other browsers, too, called Library Extension.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.160]   And I'll put links to everything we talk about in the show notes.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   But you install it.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.720]   And when you're browsing Amazon, if that book is available
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:59.040]   from a local library in digital format for free, which I'd say 50, 60,
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.440]   70 percent of the time it is, and this isn't just travel books, any book,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.600]   they immediately link you out to the site and you can go download that book
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.880]   for free and usually get 30, 45 days and you can go through the whole thing.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.560]   It's amazing. Exactly.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.920]   So I think that reading guidebooks, not only does it bring back
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.840]   the nostalgia of travel of yesteryear, but it also is like a really great way
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.520]   of understanding somebody else's perspective on a city
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.160]   and getting to know through somebody else's eyes what they think
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.840]   should be the top sites and look in every guidebook.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.520]   It's always going to be the same top 25, more or less for every city.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.280]   But when you want to get into specialized experiences, OK,
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.480]   I want to go see Jewish Prague or I want to go on a food crawl in Rome
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.160]   or I want to go on a bar crawl in Ireland.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.320]   We turn to destination management companies and DMCs.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.480]   And so the best thing to do is just Google Ireland DMC, right?
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   Or Rome DMC.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.320]   And you'll come back with a bunch of different people, providers
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.880]   who can actually sometimes offer free itineraries on their website
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.720]   of what they would take around for clients.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.280]   Are these like tour guides?
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.160]   Yeah, they're a mix of like tour operators and tour guides.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.120]   So tour operators mean somebody who puts together an itinerary,
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.800]   whether it's for one person or a thousand in a city.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.960]   They don't necessarily have a big, you know, red open top bus.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.720]   They sometimes are operating at a sprinter vans or even taxis and Ubers.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.280]   But they're taking you around and showing you the city from the inside
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.920]   with a local guide.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.160]   And sometimes they're great and they're inexpensive.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.520]   Sometimes they're very expensive.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.360]   So you can find a DMC that suits your needs in every market.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.960]   But I think the key thing to do with DMCs is look at what their itineraries are
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.000]   that they're showing online and get a sense of what you'd want to do in that city.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.840]   Maybe it makes sense to reach out to them.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.880]   Maybe it doesn't.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.320]   Look, if you work with a travel advisor, they'll recommend certain DMCs
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.880]   in certain cities based on your travel profile and what you're looking for.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.480]   But again, that may be overkill for your needs as well.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.000]   And you don't have to book with them, right?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.720]   You can just look at their itinerary and say, wow,
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.360]   they do these seven things in Jordan.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.720]   But like this, only this one sounds interesting.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.000]   Let me just search around and find someone that does that.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.080]   Well, bingo.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.920]   And so for that, we have a bunch of different other micro DMC options.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.880]   A good example of this is there's a local tour guide company called Show Around.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   And this is less about actually professional tour guides
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.040]   and more about like enthusiastic locals, people who will happily show you
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.680]   their neighborhood or their barrio or whatever it is.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.360]   So I highly recommend that.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.160]   I also love Eat With.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.920]   They are just like it sounds like a website where you can
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.960]   it's a marketplace to find people you could eat with.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.240]   They're either chefs who are going to cook a meal for you,
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.360]   or they're actually people who will show you around on a food tour
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.440]   of a certain area, a destination.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.320]   I want the best pork sugo meatballs in Bologna.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.160]   OK, whatever it is. So good.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.600]   So I definitely recommend finding those kinds of people.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.280]   Another thing we do a lot for clients on their first time in a market
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.600]   is we book a photography session with them.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.080]   And that's because they can really get an experience for a place,
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.560]   but also get some cool like photos to take home for their Christmas cards
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.640]   through the eyes of a local.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.560]   And so there are a number of companies that do this.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.240]   Flytographer is one. Blink is another.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.040]   But they'll basically set up photo shoots for you and your family
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.960]   or loved ones or whomever in front of the Eiffel Tower or at the Coliseum.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.160]   And it's a pretty cool way of bringing a memento home,
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.120]   but also getting to see a particular spot in a particular light.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.320]   And I think something that's interesting is the value isn't just
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.080]   someone shows you around town.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.480]   It's someone who's tapped into what's happening.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.920]   So I think we went on a free tour in Buenos Aires
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.520]   and the tour was great. We walked around.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.680]   And by the way, if anyone's considering these free tours
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.520]   at the end of every free tour, there's tips.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.320]   So I wouldn't consider it completely free.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.560]   If you're on a bootstrap budget and you have no money and you say, thank you.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.040]   I'm so broke, but I just I had to want to take a tour.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.320]   I really appreciate it.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.400]   You're not going to get looked at inappropriately.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.720]   People are going to understand.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   But I think it's such a great way to get to see the city.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.920]   And someone said, oh, yeah, there's a soccer game, football game
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   going on tonight. You should check it out.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.360]   And we went to this very untouristic event where the away
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.400]   fans are caged off sides, front and top, have to enter the stadium
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.240]   separately because people get into their soccer.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.400]   But that was an experience that doesn't show up on the DMC itinerary
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.320]   or Lonely Planet anywhere because it's so time dependent.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.200]   Outside of local just happening to tell you or maybe the concierge,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.240]   any other tricks for finding these kind of like cool events or festivals
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.280]   when you're in a city?
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.200]   Number one, leave time in your itinerary for spontaneity
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.240]   because it's going to happen.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.120]   You're going to be at an Irish bar and all of a sudden a crack session
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.280]   happens where the local musicians pull out their gear and you're like,
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.000]   I'm not leaving. My day is here.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.800]   So definitely leave time for spontaneity, but also take a look at some
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   of the international media around what events are happening in that city
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.440]   or in that market.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.720]   I actually love time out the international media brand.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.360]   They often have a lot of really good events happening.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.760]   You can check in advance, check it a couple of times.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.000]   You should also reach out to your credit card companies.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.680]   Their concierge departments often have static sort of like city guides,
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.760]   as well as like a what's happening city guide.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.040]   And if you reach out to them and say, hey, I'm a platinum card holder,
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.880]   I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.800]   They'll actually provide you with a bunch of information on a city
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.480]   that you can then use to plan your trip.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.800]   And they can also book things for you.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.240]   So one of the things that I think is always difficult
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.840]   when you're trying to make restaurant reservations in a country
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.280]   when you don't speak the language is that you don't speak the language.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.280]   You don't do I will call them. What do I say?
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.960]   And these people for free, right?
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.120]   These concierges linked to your credit cards are completely free.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.800]   They'll not only give you the list, but I'm pretty sure they'll call
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.040]   and make the reservations, too.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.560]   Oh, yeah. And so American Express is a great example of this.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.680]   When I have clients going to Tokyo,
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.440]   the best thing to do is honestly work with the Amex concierge
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.400]   to get restaurant reservations, because it's a little hard in Japanese
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.040]   when you don't speak Japanese and or the reservations.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.640]   Folks at the restaurant aren't so keen to deal with the gringos.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.480]   So what ends up happening is we work with Amex Platinum concierge
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.640]   to book a restaurant reservation for someone.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.000]   And even if they don't take American Express, which is the best part,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.120]   American Express can make that reservation for you.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   And that's really valuable for us.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.160]   So definitely leverage your credit card companies as much as possible.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.200]   Again, be wary of whose incentives you're working with.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.440]   If you're talking to the local hotel concierge or Amex, for that matter,
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.120]   just make sure you're getting the biggest picture before you say yes to one answer.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.280]   What does that mean exactly?
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.600]   Who's on the take?
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.520]   Who's getting their favorite kickback from someone?
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.920]   That's all. And that can happen even with Amex or Chase's concierge.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   Here's a great example.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.160]   Right. Deep down a rabbit hole of points.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.520]   American Express, when you call them and say, I want to book a flight,
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.400]   they really want you to use their points
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.000]   to pay for whatever flight that you find that you think is good.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.120]   The reality is you can often get that same flight
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.800]   by using American Express points, but transferring them to a partner.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.080]   And I'm sure you'll go into this on your points and miles chat.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.320]   But you can transfer those points away from American Express to a partner
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.040]   and book at that partner's website for a lot less
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.520]   than if you actually book through American Express using their points on their website.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.200]   But Amex will tell you that this is the best deal
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.000]   and they won't be looking really out for you.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.480]   They'll be looking out for them.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.040]   So again, just be careful and be wary.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.560]   Talk to people. Talk to a travel advisor.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.440]   Look online for reviews before you pull the trigger
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.360]   on any of these credit card company recommended options.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.200]   Cool. Last local recommendation, food.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.920]   Yeah. How? There's nothing better than an amazing meal in another country, I think.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.600]   And if you're coming to San Francisco, I could rattle off a handful of recommendations.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   And one of the things I like to do sometimes is if I'm looking at a guidebook,
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.760]   I'm like, what do they say to do in San Francisco?
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.200]   And the sad thing is a lot of times the restaurants that aren't the ones
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.680]   you would recommend, are there any ways to find that equivalent list
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.440]   of those great local spots in other countries when things like Yelp
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.800]   and TripAdvisor are just filled with the tourist traps in those countries?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.200]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.800]   My God, then it all depends on how daring and adventurous you're willing to be.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.720]   Right. Because if you're going to Iceland and you want to eat whale,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.240]   like you can do that and there's a way to do that.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.080]   Do you really want to do it?
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.760]   Like you have to check in with yourself before you go to some of these countries.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.320]   And it can be feel very uncomfortable for North Americans
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.600]   who don't speak a certain language to be in a food hotspot
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.400]   and not know what you're eating or what's put on my mind.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.600]   I don't even know what this is, but I'll eat it.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.640]   So I thrive on that, too.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.440]   And I think the best ways of doing that are number one, just like you said,
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.840]   go on a food tour, right? Get acquainted with the market.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.280]   And then when I say the market, I literally mean the market,
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.160]   where the food comes from and understand how food is bought and sold in a country.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.840]   What foods are delicious in that country? Who eats them?
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.000]   Number two is try to find a local with whom you can go out.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.680]   Now, that's not easy, right?
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.800]   A company like Eat With, that'll help you.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.920]   The concierge actually could be very helpful in that.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.320]   And there are certain cities that have hotel concierges
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.800]   that will walk you to the restaurant, help you understand the menu
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.240]   and order for you, and then they'll leave and go back to the hotel.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.400]   That's an incredible value add when you're clueless in Seoul
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.720]   or you have no idea what you're eating in Shanghai or Chengdu.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.200]   So definitely do that.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.960]   But I think that the best thing to do is to research ahead of time on dishes,
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.040]   experiences and types of restaurants, not necessarily like the name
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.760]   of the place you need to go, but types of restaurants.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.920]   So that when you show up in a city, you can say, hey, listen,
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.480]   I really want to try these things.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.760]   And you're sitting down with the concierge
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.040]   or you're sitting down with a friendly local you just met.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:25.960]   How do I do this?
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.720]   And asking vulnerably for some guidance,
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.240]   you'd be amazed by what happens and what you can find.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.880]   Yeah, I've never really thought about it from that perspective.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.160]   But if you go to someone and say, what's the best restaurant?
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.280]   Their first answer might be, oh, my buddy's place.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.320]   But if you go and say, where do I get the most authentic?
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.040]   Yeah, give me these dumplings or give me this roasted animal part
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.800]   or whatever it is.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.000]   And like, look, let's face it.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.960]   That's why we're traveling.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.920]   We want to come back with these memories of, oh, my God, this meal I had.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.720]   And so, yes, use social media ahead of time, find those things,
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.840]   but also give a chance for some spontaneity.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.800]   Don't think that you have to go to the top place.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:04.000]   Look, I went to a three Michelin star restaurant in Lyon in France
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.440]   by a titan of French cuisine, and I thought it was one of the worst
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.480]   meals I've ever had in my entire life.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.240]   But have to live up to the hype of the, you know, hundreds
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.480]   or maybe thousands of dollars you spend for it.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:18.760]   Right. Most of the best meals I've had are at food stalls, at markets.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.960]   If you go to the-- At the random bistro in the corner, right?
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   It's-- Yes. Yeah.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.440]   In Bangkok, there's a market.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.320]   It's the Or Tor Kor Market, and it's across the highway
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.520]   from like the main market, but it's just like a giant open community food place.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.720]   Yeah. The stalls in there are better than every single expensive restaurant we had.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.920]   And those are the kind of experiences I love.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.040]   And I have no idea if I picked the five star stall.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.520]   I sometimes I'm like, where are all the people that look like they're from here
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.800]   lining up? Yeah. And let's just line up behind them.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.720]   Yeah, exactly. And let's point if we don't speak Thai and we like want that thing.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.080]   Maybe it's spicy frog legs.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.200]   Who cares? You're trying it. It's going to be great.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.480]   And again, in the end, you're going to remember that much more
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.560]   than you can remember the fancy three star meal.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.240]   100%.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.560]   You all know I love credit card points,
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.600]   so I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.240]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.200]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.840]   and makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.960]   bonuses on every purchase.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.000]   You can also load it on your partner's phone,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.600]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.160]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.440]   and recurring credit from over 5000 cards.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.200]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase,
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.840]   Bank of America or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.160]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.720]   every single Amex and Chase offer in just one click.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.320]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:54.080]   you can do all of this without having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.520]   The app is free to download and many of the features are free as well.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.560]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.880]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:11.840]   you can go to all the hacks dot com slash card pointers to get 20% off.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.880]   Again, that's all the hacks dot com slash card pointers.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.400]   Rehearsals for the school play were really coming along.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.280]   Bigger smile, Mr. Squirrel.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.600]   Until a custodian accidentally threw away the costumes.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.040]   Oh, no. Everyone was rattled.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.840]   Miss Geraghty forgot how to play.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.160]   And the queen of the hedgehogs almost quit.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.880]   Find a new queen.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.360]   But replacement costumes were shipped with FedEx.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.080]   And with added peace of mind from picture proof of delivery,
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.520]   everyone could focus on the perfect opening night.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.240]   FedEx, where now meets next.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.520]   For residential delivery only.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.960]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.720]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs,
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.520]   codes, deals and discounts from our partners.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.760]   You can go to all the hacks dot com slash deals.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.160]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.440]   So that's a great thing.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.800]   You're going to this food stall in the middle of a time market,
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.200]   and I'm pretty sure they're not going to take a credit card.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.640]   In fact, I'm certain they're not going to take a credit card.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.560]   How do you get cash when you're going to one of these countries?
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.480]   So the traveler's check is dead.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.080]   OK, exchanging money ahead of time is a terrible idea
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.840]   because you're just going to end up paying for the nose,
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.560]   for the exchange rate that you don't want.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.200]   It's not favorable in your direction.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.760]   So what I really recommend to people when they're traveling abroad
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   is bring a couple hundred US dollars in smaller bills
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.680]   in your carry on or somewhere safe with you and then bring an ATM card
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.120]   and make sure you've checked ahead of time with the ATM card
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.120]   that you're going to be able to use it internationally,
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.200]   that they won't hose you on fees and that they know you're traveling right now.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.720]   When you get to the airport in your first destination,
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.640]   go to the first big sort of box brand ATM
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.560]   you can find the HSBC or the Scotia Bank or the what?
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.680]   Citibank or whatever in that airport arrivals hall and get cash out there.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.680]   I usually like to get the max out, right?
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:03.800]   So if I'm spending three days in a market and I know that I'm going to be,
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.640]   you know, spending a lot of cash, Bangkok is a great example.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.600]   I'll get whatever my ATM max is, 500 bucks, 750, whatever,
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.800]   just to have that cash on hand.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.920]   And that's the cash that I'm going to use.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.320]   I'm never going to want to exchange at a hotel.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.960]   The rates are always terrible.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.600]   Never going to want to go to one of those exchange rates
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.400]   with like neon signs on the corner,
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.200]   because who knows what they're doing with my passport data?
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.840]   And also the rates are terrible.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.800]   And I don't really want to use some random ATM
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   that the restaurant is walking me to because they say, oh,
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.320]   you have to use this ATM to pay us because we don't take credit.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:35.360]   And I ran out of cash.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.200]   So I'm always trying to plan ahead
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.640]   when I'm getting down like the last hundred bucks or so.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.200]   Go take out a couple more hundred.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.280]   Keep it in my pocket, spread it around.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.440]   But I think the key thing is your ATM card is your lifeline for cash.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.080]   Don't use any other type of cash unless it's an emergency and you need to.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.040]   Yeah. And so I think if you want to make sure you never run out of local currency,
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.400]   you're probably going to end your trip with more.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.920]   Obviously, we've all had our fair share of buying ridiculous stuff
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.800]   at the airport before you come home.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.080]   And you're like, I guess I'll burn $50 on you.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.960]   I need more shot glasses. Yeah, right. Yeah.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.240]   But let's say I've got two or three hundred bucks.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.400]   Any hacks for how to get rid of it without getting hosed on the exchange rate?
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.600]   Yeah. So I always keep about 40 or 50 bucks for the airport, just in case,
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   in case there's like a departure tax I didn't know about or there's some
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.520]   airport security fee you got to pay in cash or whatever.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.560]   But let's say I've got two hundred bucks in my pocket
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.840]   when I'm checking out of the last hotel, even if it's been on my credit card
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.800]   and even if I want the credit card points,
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.880]   I'll go to the hotel front desk and say, hey, listen, I'd like to buy down
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.160]   $150 worth of my hotel bill using this cash.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.520]   They're always going to take the cash.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.080]   They're always going to be able to buy you down or reduce your rate
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.400]   so that you're not putting everything on your credit card
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.640]   and you're not also walking out with a giant wad of cash.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.160]   So I definitely do that or I'll pay for the airport transfer
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.960]   that should have been included in my hotel bill.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   I'll pay for that in cash or whatever it is
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.000]   to basically help burn that last little bit off.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.240]   Worst case scenario, you bring home a few bucks and you exchange it
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.520]   at the airport in that country before you leave.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.200]   I never like to bring it home to the States because you're just going to get screwed.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   They're just going to once you land and step foot in the States,
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.040]   they know your money that you have in your pocket is worthless to you.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.480]   So they're just going to turn the screws on you.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.280]   And that's we never want that.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.280]   Yeah. And when you're checking out at the hotel
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   and you're finally putting the rest of that hotel on your credit card,
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.800]   please do not choose to be billed in U.S. dollars.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.560]   Oh, God, no.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.240]   This whole dynamic currency conversion scam is the worst.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.840]   Basically, what it is, is this.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.840]   Banks have gotten really intelligent about how to extract
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.520]   every dollar possible from people.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.120]   And so now you need a hack back.
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.160]   That's the purpose of this show is like banks and credit card companies
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.000]   and airlines and hotels like I love them.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.480]   I want great experiences,
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.400]   but I also want to find every chance to get the best experience at the best price.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.680]   Yeah. And you don't want to feel like you've been taken for a ride.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.120]   And so what what hotels or what credit card companies, banks are doing is
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.720]   they're actually asking you to pay in a Thai hotel in U.S. dollars.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.280]   And that doesn't make any sense.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.600]   When you're in Thailand, you should be using Thai baht.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.040]   So when you're actually presented with a credit card terminal,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.600]   it's going to say press one for Thai baht or press two for U.S. dollars.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.400]   And you might think, geez, U.S. dollars, how easy is that?
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   There's two things wrong here.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.080]   One, it's called dynamic currency conversion.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.120]   It's a scheme the banks use to basically charge you an inflated interest rate
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.240]   that you're getting screwed on.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:26.040]   OK, and number two, your bank may still charge you a foreign transaction fee
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.760]   if they do so on the U.S. dollar transaction because it's coming from Thailand.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.920]   So you could be paying twice once on an overly inflated rate.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.880]   That might be something like 10 or 12 percent more than you need to be paying.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.000]   And two on a foreign exchange rate, which is a foreign exchange fee,
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.160]   which is the worst.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.560]   So take a credit card, pay in Thai baht
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.840]   and make sure it's a card that has no foreign transaction fees. Exactly.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.040]   There's so many cards these days that have no foreign transaction fees.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.120]   So make sure that's the case.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.880]   And while you're at it, make sure to tell the credit card company you're traveling.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.880]   Yes, there is nothing worse than showing up in a country
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.840]   and trying to use your credit card or your ATM card, having it not work,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.320]   having to figure out how you can make that twenty five dollar phone call
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.560]   back to the U.S. to get your card enabled.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.880]   So make sure you give them a heads up so you don't have any problems.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.400]   Speaking of phone calls, one of the hacks I love is trying to get a local SIM card.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.840]   In some countries, this is really hard.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.880]   And you've basically got to go give an ID and you've got to put a lot of money down.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.360]   And in some countries, a lot of African countries, it's give a dollar
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.520]   and you get a SIM card and you can sell them in the arrivals hall.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.040]   Yeah. And it's super easy.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.400]   But the hack here is if you have a phone that supports it,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:36.280]   and I think starting with maybe the iPhone 11, it's always supported.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.680]   You can actually have unlimited number of virtual SIM cards
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.320]   in addition to your one SIM card you put in the phone.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.680]   And so call Verizon, go on Verizon's website.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.880]   Google Fi does this.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:51.560]   A lot of carriers do now convert your Verizon SIM card to an eSIM.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.680]   Now you have your SIM card free.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.080]   So when you're overseas, you can still have your phone on your home carrier,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:04.520]   but you can get a local SIM card, put it in and say, use my data on this new SIM card.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.360]   And then you don't have to worry about pulling out your Verizon card,
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.480]   losing it, not being able to take an emergency phone call.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.640]   But you can actually get local, cheaper data in that country.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.960]   If you don't have that, a lot of countries now rent out
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.000]   those little like portable hotspots.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:19.840]   Yeah, little MiFis.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.640]   Yeah. That one's great because then you can use it with the whole family.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.400]   You just have to charge it every day and carry a second device.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.520]   Any other kind of data phone call hacks when you're traveling?
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.120]   So I always like to download the Google Maps
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.040]   offline version of the city that I'm going to make sure
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.520]   that I have all of the maps ahead of time, because, look, Google Maps,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.040]   it can just eat your data up when you're traveling abroad
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.080]   and you need it when you're traveling abroad.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.280]   So because of that, I always download ahead of time.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.800]   I also will use Google Translate as often as possible, and I'll actually screenshot,
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.800]   especially when it's some of the Asian languages that are not written
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.960]   in traditional Roman letters.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.360]   I'll screenshot some of this traditional phrases and I'll like flashcards,
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.400]   study them on the plane so that I don't have to be using Google Translate
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.080]   consistently when I'm overseas.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.520]   But you can download Google Translate offline also, which is pretty good for me.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.400]   If I'm looking at a Chinese menu in China, I don't understand it.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.640]   But you can go with Google Translate and you can take a photo
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.360]   and they will in real time translate a photo of a sign in the subway of a menu.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.320]   It's so cool. It is so cool.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.560]   And so those two tools I can't live without ahead of time.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:29.760]   But I think that the biggest thing that you can do on the data side
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.000]   is check with your carrier here in the States and say,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.240]   does it make sense for me to be spending ten bucks a day in Europe?
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.040]   Or can I buy like a European plan for a month where it's ninety nine bucks
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.040]   or one hundred and twenty five dollars or whatever it is?
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.680]   Check to see if your carrier will offer that.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:46.320]   If you're on the road for a long time, those ten dollar a day charges,
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.520]   especially for a family of four, can really add up.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.600]   Yeah, it's worth considering if you're starting to travel a lot.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:56.440]   Google Fi, T-Mobile, some carriers have international coverage
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.280]   all around the world with data. Yeah, totally free.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.760]   So I had a Google Fi sim for a while.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:05.440]   It's one of the rare cases where I'd say it's so much better experience
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.680]   with Android than it is with iOS, which is a bummer as an iPhone user.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.800]   But it's great for international data.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.080]   And if you travel a lot, it could be worth having that as just a separate backup.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.680]   Yeah, I know you could probably get a couple of gigs of data
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:21.400]   on T-Mobile or Google Fi for twenty thirty bucks a month,
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.880]   which if you're making a trip every two or three months and makes total sense,
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.960]   it could make total sense.
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.440]   Let me also switch gears for a quick sec and just talk about
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.080]   where you don't want to bring your phone.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.000]   And that is to places where this might not be safe
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.360]   to have your own iPhone or smartphone.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.640]   So maybe you do have a backup burner phone that you can use,
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.320]   that you can wipe clean quickly if you need to when you're traveling
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.920]   to sensitive countries.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.360]   Definitely have advised clients who travel overseas to do that,
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.760]   and they've definitely had instances where they've needed to do that.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.560]   So just bring a backup phone or have a backup phone just in case.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.480]   And if you're traveling to a country where privacy laws
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.920]   and human rights are challenging, like be careful, like maybe don't bring
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.880]   the computer that has your entire life stored on it.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.320]   Maybe don't bring the computer that has a word doc on your desktop
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.720]   with every password to every site and definitely don't carry that around town.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.160]   So we got to the country.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.200]   We stayed. We figured out the way to hack everything local.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.320]   This was amazing.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.680]   Now I'm a little disappointed because I just want to go on more trips.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.360]   I feel like hopefully 2021 can shape up to be a year where we can go places.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.120]   Do you have any trips planned?
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.880]   So I just got back recently from Turks and Caicos, which was just bananas.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.000]   It was just so beautiful.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.280]   And the beaches are incredible.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.680]   And I can't recommend that destination enough. So beautiful.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.920]   My next trip was supposed to be to Italy this summer.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen work challenges,
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:42.000]   I think I'll probably have to reschedule that one for later in the year.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.960]   But we do have New York on the docket.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.920]   A lot of other domestic travel coming up.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.480]   Traveling with little kids during the pandemic has been tricky.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.760]   And as you know, vaccinated travelers can now travel overseas fairly easily.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.200]   But if you're under 16 and not vaccinated, there's a big gray area.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:00.000]   So it should be interesting the next couple of months to see how that unfolds
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.320]   and how we take care of our little ones on the road.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.520]   Yeah. Wow.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.040]   I didn't even think about that as someone traveling with a nine month old, but.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.680]   She'll be fine.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.240]   Yeah. But you mentioned your slam with work.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.080]   Can you tell us a little bit more about Savanti?
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.440]   Yeah. So we're full service travel management for busy executives.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:17.800]   What that means is we handle people's travel, just like an accountant
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.400]   would handle their money or a lawyer would handle their legal affairs.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   So we're really on somebody's team.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.440]   So we're not right for everybody in the sense that we don't do any one off trips
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.800]   or plan a single vacation or honeymoon.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.760]   Instead, we get to really know our clients and really operate
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.680]   as an extension of their team so that we help them with everything
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.280]   from Southwest tickets to private jets or a holiday
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:42.240]   and express stay or a private yacht or a villa, everything in between.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:46.960]   But what we've done over the past few years is built up an extensive collection
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:51.760]   of really good relationships in the travel business that allow us to hack our way
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:56.080]   for our clients into experiences that they themselves couldn't get on their own.
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:00.120]   So it's been really wonderful and incredibly gratifying to see this business
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.600]   blossom over the past five years to learn so much.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.280]   Oh, my God, there's so much more to learn.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.120]   But every day is a new adventure and is really fun.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.480]   And it's been great to see our clients come out of the sort of pandemic
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.760]   with a renewed sense of excitement around all the destinations
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.880]   that they can't wait to get to.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.480]   We can't wait to help them get there.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.000]   That's awesome.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.440]   Yeah. If you're listening and you have other questions, hacks, ideas,

[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.960]   Maybe we'll bring Lee back again and handle a bunch of questions from listeners.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.280]   Where can people find you online?
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.880]   So on Twitter at Lee Rowan or at Savanti Travel dot com.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.800]   Chris, thank you so much for having me.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.920]   This is great to chat, travel.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.840]   It's great to see you.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.680]   It's great to be doing this in person again
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.200]   and actually seeing another human for the first time in so long.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.320]   But thank you for making this happen. I really appreciate it.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.320]   This was amazing.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.200]   I can't wait to get out there and travel.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.720]   And I hope this helps a lot of people do the same. Likewise.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.720]   All right. That's it for this episode of all the hacks.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.000]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.640]   I'm just getting started with this show.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.800]   So if you like what you heard, I'd really appreciate a rating in your podcast app
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.240]   or if you'll simply tell a friend about the show, that would be amazing.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.080]   And finally, if you want to find links to anything we discussed today
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.800]   or if you want to share a suggestion for what we can talk about in the future,

[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.100]   (whooshing)
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.080]   [ Silence ]
