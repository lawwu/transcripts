[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   We close out our third full year of episodes
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.640]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast with episode number 761.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.000]   My, that is a lot of grace, that's a lot of episodes.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.440]   And so many of you are financial partners
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.800]   of the ministry who support our work.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160]   And I wanna say thank you for partnering with us
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.300]   and for making those 761 episodes possible.
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.740]   As we near the end of one year, we get reflective.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.980]   And as we approach the new year, we get prophetic.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.120]   And one question we tend to see this time of year,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.000]   Pastor John, looking into 2016 is this.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.720]   Pastor John, from your vantage point,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.960]   what are the biggest challenges
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.580]   facing the evangelical church today
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.360]   and into the near future?
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.540]   What events or issues come to mind?
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.200]   Well, I'm never very good at contemporary events
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.560]   or the latest hot button issues.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.760]   And that doesn't bother me too much
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.960]   because I don't think the major challenges
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.180]   in any generation are unique to that generation.
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.920]   There are unique challenges to every generation.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.560]   They just don't happen to be the main challenges
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.700]   in every generation because the main challenges
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.080]   stay the same from generation to generation.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.080]   And so when my mind presses into main, deepest,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.220]   strongest, greatest challenge,
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.320]   I think in a sequence from,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.320]   there's a cluster of challenges around truth and knowledge,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.280]   and that means Bible.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.840]   And then there's a cluster of issues around heart
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.640]   and affection and faith and response.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.860]   And then there's a cluster of issues around behavior
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.460]   or action or deeds in the world.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.740]   And so let me just walk through that.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.520]   That's the way my mind works.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.920]   I just think those are the huge issues
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.440]   because if you start at the beginning,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.400]   the first and great commandment says,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.760]   "You shall love the Lord your God
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.940]   with all your heart and soul and mind and strength."
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.160]   So I would think since that's the first commandment,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.920]   that's the first challenge in every generation.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.640]   Does the church, does the world love God
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.840]   with all their heart and all their soul
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.080]   and all their mind and all their strength?
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.440]   And I was talking to Louis Giglio the other day,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.960]   on a podcast that he does,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.520]   and he said that someone had asked him the question
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.800]   and he wanted to pitch it to me about,
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.120]   "Why so much talk about theology?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.280]   Why does Piper always come to Passion
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.360]   and do the heavy lifting of theology
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.680]   and others get into theology?
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.360]   And Louis, you're known for taking the Bible so seriously.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.720]   What's the point of all this theology?"
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.840]   And my answer was to quote a
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.040]   Middle Ages theologian,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.300]   and I think it was Bonaventure,
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300]   who when asked, "Why don't people love God more?"
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.500]   His answer was, "They don't know him better."
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.940]   In other words, if we don't know God, we can't love God.
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.780]   I'm not one of those people who think
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.780]   that the intensity of authentic worship rises
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.760]   to the degree that we don't understand the mystery of God.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.480]   I mean, there are people who seem to wanna correlate,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.440]   "Oh, my worship is just so strong
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.360]   when I realize what I don't know."
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   I say, "Well, there is a sense in which God is vastly
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.540]   beyond us because infinite is beyond finite,
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.520]   but our worship to glorify God
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.680]   must be based on what we've seen of God,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.320]   what we know of God, what he's revealed of himself."
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.120]   If we're just worshiping a haze,
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.320]   God is not getting a lot of glory
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.440]   from the warm feelings that we're having in our hearts
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.000]   because of the ignorance in our heads,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.840]   because of the haze over our lives.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.160]   I've got this picture in my head
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.040]   of somebody who runs up to me on the road and says,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.440]   "Here's $10,000.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.680]   Please go put it in my bank,
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.760]   and here's my pin, and here's my account number."
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.680]   And I say, "I don't even know you.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.840]   What are you doing?"
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.080]   And he just said, "I trust you."
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.400]   I say, "Why do you trust me?"
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.320]   And he says, "Oh, I don't know.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.800]   I'm just trusting you.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.120]   I feel inside like I should trust you."
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.880]   My response is not to be honored.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.520]   I feel like this guy's a nut.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.120]   However, if he runs up to me and says,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.460]   "Here's $10,000 in cash.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.440]   Please, here's my account number, here's my pin number.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   Would you deposit it for me?"
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.400]   And I say, "Look, I don't even know you.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.240]   Why do you trust me?"
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.880]   He says, "Oh, I know you.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.160]   We work in the same building.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.080]   I've been watching you for a year.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.480]   You're trustworthy.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.640]   I'll trust you 'cause I know you."
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.320]   Then I feel honored.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.280]   And that's the way it is with God.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.640]   If we say, "Oh, I'm just coming to God.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.460]   I trust him.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.600]   I don't have any reasons for trusting him.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.360]   I don't need that theology stuff."
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.360]   God thinks we're nuts.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.640]   We're not honoring him.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.720]   We're honoring a haze.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   And so knowledge really matters underneath the commandment.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.240]   You gotta love God with all your heart and soul.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.720]   So today, I think the biggest challenge is,
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.040]   do people know God?
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.920]   Do people have a knowledge that is trustworthy
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.820]   and therefore a huge issue is,
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.200]   what's the role of the Bible in the church today?
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.480]   And is it trustworthy?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.400]   And are people basing their lives on it
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.760]   and they're preaching on it?
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.160]   Are they getting the whole counsel of God
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.920]   so that they can love the whole God?
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.800]   So those are kind of the first two clusters for me,
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.960]   all woven together.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.760]   The knowledge issues is true knowledge
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.320]   being disseminated about God.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.800]   Is the whole counsel of God really being taught
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.940]   in the church?
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.040]   Is the wholehearted love of God happening
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.400]   in response to this knowledge?
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.280]   And that leads to the third cluster,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.520]   namely, I'm teaching First Peter right now.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.600]   And First Peter, if anything is competing
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.960]   in First Peter with prominence, with hope,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.880]   competing in prominence with hope,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.120]   that's a big theme in First Peter,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.080]   what's competing with it is good deeds,
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.480]   good deeds over and over again.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.240]   So Peter has the conception that we should not
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.760]   be conformed to the passions of our former ignorance.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.300]   Do you see the sequence there?
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.840]   Ignorance leading to passions, leading to bad behavior.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.240]   And he says, no, you're not in your former ignorance
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.960]   anymore, you've got knowledge of God,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.560]   knowledge of Christ, knowledge of hope,
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.800]   knowledge of the resurrection, knowledge of new birth,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.280]   knowledge of the second coming,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.380]   knowledge of his care for you at every moment
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.500]   in your suffering, you've got knowledge,
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.100]   and this knowledge is gonna produce new passions,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.360]   and these passions now conform you to a new set of behavior.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.200]   And so over and over again, he says,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.920]   keep your conduct among the Gentiles,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.800]   honorable and good, so that when they see your good conduct,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.020]   they will glorify God on the day of visitation.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.800]   So that's our goal in this world.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.640]   We're on a mission in this world
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.440]   to bring people to glorify God.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.160]   That is the biggest challenge.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.560]   So to know God, to love God, to act in ways
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.280]   that the world will stand up and say,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.680]   whoa, tell me the reason for the hope that is in you,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.880]   because you're acting in a way that is so counterintuitive
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.840]   to my hopes that you must have different hopes.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.360]   And then we're off to the races in bearing witness
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.920]   to the, what he calls, the excellencies
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.860]   of the one who called us out of darkness
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.320]   into his marvelous light.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.080]   A new year with the same mission.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.920]   That is so good.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.600]   And as we step into the new year tomorrow,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   we will be talking about the spiritual disciplines.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.360]   And it's a good time to think through the habits
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.380]   and patterns to set in place for our spiritual flourishing.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.400]   In 2016, it's always good to start the new year
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.800]   thinking about these things, and we'll do that tomorrow.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.320]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
