[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   We end the week with a question from Isaac, who listens to us in his hometown of Nairobi,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.880]   Kenya.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.760]   Pastor John, thank you, thank you, thank you for your encouragements in APJ 1611, "How
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.400]   Does Chronic Pain Glorify God?"
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.120]   I resonate with this episode deeply and I carry those promises for myself.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.040]   I have a question concerning the story or the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.200]   Luke 16 verses 19 to 31, specifically about Lazarus.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.680]   Please help me make at least some sense of his life.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.000]   He lived all of it poor.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   He died poor.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.120]   It shouldn't bother me, but it does.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.720]   I carry neurological, physical, and mental disabilities and have for many years as an
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.280]   invalid, unable to create any life for myself.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.320]   I am now 30.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.720]   Feel I should have become a productive, self-reliant man by now?
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.720]   I'm not.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.120]   I may never be.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.920]   But we also don't see a definite purpose or self-will or self-drive in Lazarus's life
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   either.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.640]   I also lack those very same things.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.360]   How would you motivate a disabled man, disabled nearly to the degree of Lazarus, to not waste
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.080]   his life as his physical life wastes away?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.360]   Well, of course, this is a dangerous thing for me to do, to venture to give counsel to
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:33.200]   someone whose condition I know so little about, especially when he says, "I carry neurological,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.520]   physical, and mental disabilities."
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:47.960]   So please understand, Isaac, that what I say here is tentative as far as its specific applications
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.600]   to you go, even though I do want to stand by the biblical things I'm going to say.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.360]   So a warning, and I want to defer to you to know yourself.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.240]   First I would remind you of the parable of the talents in Matthew 25, 14, following.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.320]   The master, and he represents Christ, gave to one of his servants five talents.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.000]   Now you know that a talent is an amount of money in those days, not an ability to do
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.680]   something, but I think it does represent any kind of resource that we have as a gift of
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.880]   God that he expects us to use for his honor.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.360]   And he gave one, five, as I said, and he gave another, two talents, and he gave another
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.000]   one talent, and then he went on a journey, and when he came back he called them to account
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   to see whether they had wasted their lives in his resources.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.200]   Now two things seem relevant from this parable for your situation, Isaac.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.480]   One is that God clearly recognizes that different disciples have different capacities.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.000]   Five, two, one.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   That's a great difference.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.600]   Being one and five, what is that, 500% difference?
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:21.360]   And he doesn't expect that the person with fewer resources will produce the same amount
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.560]   as the one with the greater resources.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.360]   He says, "Well done," to the man who turns five into ten, and he says the same, "Well
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.000]   done," to the man who turns two into four.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.680]   So you should infer from this that God will call you to account not to be as productive
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.280]   as someone with a different set of gifts and limitations, but simply in accord with what
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.600]   he's made you capable of.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.160]   That's the first thing.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.820]   Second thing that this parable says to your situation is that that third man who basically
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:10.680]   did nothing with his single talent was not scolded because he didn't turn one into two.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.000]   He was scolded because he didn't even put it in the bank.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.680]   In other words, it sounds like the master is saying, "Look, you say I'm a hard man,
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   hard to please.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.960]   I'm not the hard taskmaster you think.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.440]   All you had to do was put it in the bank and get interest for it and then tell me that
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.040]   I had it with my interest and why you put it in the bank."
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.680]   He would have been commended, I think, for that.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.520]   I think C.S. Lewis is right when he said that God is hard to satisfy but easy to please.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.240]   So don't feel helpless that you are going to be judged by a standard beyond what God
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.960]   has equipped you to do.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.800]   The next thing I would point out in Scripture is that Paul was given a thorn in the flesh
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:21.040]   in 2 Corinthians 12, verse 7 through 10, and the point of giving him a thorn in the flesh
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.240]   was to weaken him.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.520]   You might say he gave him a disability.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:35.480]   He pleaded with Christ to take it away, and Christ said, "No, my power is perfected
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.960]   in your weakness."
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.480]   That is an amazing statement.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:49.600]   God is not mainly looking for powerful people who can lend him their strengths.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.920]   God needs nobody's strength.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.600]   He gives, he takes according to his will.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.760]   All strength is from him, through him, and to him.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.240]   What he's looking for is trust and a deep contentment in his fellowship in the situation
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:18.680]   that he gives us because that will make him look more precious in our lives than any health
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.480]   or any wealth or anything else.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.000]   That's what he's after.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.920]   Make my power, my sufficiency look great.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.880]   And if I have to make you weak in order to make me look strong, I will.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:40.960]   So don't measure the usefulness of your life by productive capacities.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.600]   God has given you what he has given you in order that in your weakness you might rely
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.400]   upon his strength and in that way magnify his worth.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.600]   And then I would mention Isaac 2 Corinthians 9 verse 8.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.280]   God is able to make all grace abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all things
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.400]   at all times, you, Isaac, may abound in every good work.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:24.080]   Now what I take away from this verse is that every good work that God expects me or you
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.520]   to do, he will give us grace to do it.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.560]   That's what he says.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.540]   For some, that will be a lot of productive activity.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:42.000]   For others, it will be less, far less.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.720]   And the older and the weaker we get, the less productive we are going to be.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.280]   And some are assigned to be weak all their lives.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:02.320]   But what this verse implies is that you and I should wake up in the morning and ask God
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.600]   to grant us the grace, the promised grace, to do just those good works that he calls
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.840]   us to do.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   Now that may be a smile directed to a passerby or a quiet freedom from murmuring in the midst
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.080]   of misery or a healthy performance of some technical task.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:34.440]   God decides what good works we are assigned to do, and he promises to give grace to do
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.640]   them.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.620]   And the last thing I would say is a comment on Lazarus and the rich man.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.380]   This is not a parable about the character of Lazarus.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.520]   We know virtually nothing about his state of mind or heart.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:09:00.920]   He's not held up as a person of faith, though we can infer that he was a person of faith
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.080]   in God, in Jesus, because he goes to heaven while the rich man goes to Hades.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.100]   But Jesus never mentions his faith.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.120]   We do not know how resourceful Lazarus was.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   Be careful.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.440]   You say he didn't have any resourcefulness.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.920]   Well, I don't know that.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   It says in Luke 16, 20 that he was laid, was laid at the rich man's gate.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.680]   So someone is carrying him from where he lives, maybe out in Shantytown.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.560]   Someone's carrying him and putting him down at a spot where there might be some hope of
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   crumbs.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.840]   Now, did Lazarus arrange for that?
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:52.880]   Did he use the little tiny bit of resourcefulness that he had to arrange each day to be put
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:10:01.760]   in the place where there might be some little bit of food for him from the rich man's table?
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.040]   We don't know.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.080]   It's all speculation.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.080]   So don't use Lazarus as a model.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.040]   Either way, he may have been a great model of resourcefulness.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:20.840]   I have seen great resourcefulness in mentally ill people in my neighborhood who make a living
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   and live in their car.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:29.000]   And no matter how I try to help them, they want to live in their car because they have
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   proved their resourcefulness to make it by certain kind of panhandling, a certain check
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.380]   from the government, and a certain use of a dinged up old truck.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:45.840]   And I've sent them to every conceivable manner of helping institution, and they just want
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.080]   to prove their own resourcefulness.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:54.460]   In other words, it's just not simple to know when you look at a poor person what measure
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.400]   of resourcefulness they may be exercising.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.680]   So Isaac, the sum of the matter is that God knows your neurological, physical, and mental
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   limitations.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.280]   You are not a mistake.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.240]   There is a reason for your existence as you are.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:20.200]   Join the Christians around you by seeking God's wisdom for what that reason is, your
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.860]   reason for being.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:29.120]   And then as much as lies within you, by grace, give yourself to that.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:40.100]   And I wonder, Isaac, if you are aware of the great poet from the 1600s named John Milton.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:45.780]   He wrote the most famous poem in the English language, probably, Paradise Lost.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:53.420]   And in the midst of his amazing, productive life, he went blind.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:12:02.580]   And he felt that God had taken away from him the one gift that he had to be useful.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:10.560]   But eventually he wrote a sonnet about his loss, and he called it On His Blindness.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.580]   And I want to close by just reading it to you because of how encouraging it's been
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:24.540]   to me over the years and to others who feel their limits and their fading powers.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:31.780]   When I consider how my light is spent ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:38.520]   and that one talent which is death to hide lodged with me useless, though my soul more
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:46.380]   bent to serve there with my Maker, and present my true account lest he returning chide, doth
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.500]   not exact day labor, light denied, I fondly ask?
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:59.940]   But patience, to prevent that murmur, soon replies, God doth not need either man's
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.780]   work or his own gifts.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.180]   Who best bear his mild yoke, they serve him best.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:15.460]   His state is kingly, thousands at his bidding speed, and post, or land and ocean without
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:22.500]   rest, they also serve who only stand and wait.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:30.220]   That's a famous sonnet that puts words to suffering in the form of an agency frustrated.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.940]   John Milton's poem On His Blindness.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.420]   You can find the text online.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.060]   If you wish to meditate on it, just search for it.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.060]   On His Blindness.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:43.300]   It's worth reading and rereading a few times to get the depth of what is communicated here
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.540]   from Milton's heart.
