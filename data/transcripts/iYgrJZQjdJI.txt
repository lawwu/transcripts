[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.320]   - Today we're joined by Sam Albury,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.480]   an author, a speaker for Ravi Zacharias
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.440]   International Ministries, and a minister
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.120]   at St. Mary's Maidenhead Anglican Church in the UK.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.240]   He joins us today from his office in Oxford.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.160]   Sam, we have so much to discuss, so let's dive right in.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.320]   Let's actually dive right into the deep end
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.040]   and into a big ongoing debate within the church.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   As we do so, I should say that this episode of APJ
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.400]   will be slightly different because I want to use
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   this opportunity to better understand an ongoing debate
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.480]   happening inside of the church right now
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.440]   over same-sex attraction and orientation questions
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.840]   and whether or not it's appropriate
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.400]   to use the label gay Christian.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   This episode is not an attempt to finally resolve
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.680]   that debate and all of its attendant issues.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.560]   Nevertheless, Facebook and Twitter, I'm sure,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.960]   are gonna blow up after this one
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.680]   because people will want to resolve it all in comment.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.720]   My aim here is simply to raise the debate with you, Sam,
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.980]   as it stands, and to sort of bring others up to speed
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.920]   with the tensions that Christian brothers and sisters
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200]   are struggling through right now.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.360]   And to that end, we'll look at the orientation question
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.960]   in just a moment, but first, Sam, explain for us
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.160]   what do you mean by the phrase
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.440]   same-sex attracted when you use it?
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.160]   - Thank you, yeah, these are some very big issues,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.840]   so I can only kind of sketch out
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.600]   where I'm at in my own thinking on this.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.200]   Certainly for me, the only romantic and sexual feelings
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.400]   I've ever experienced have been towards other men,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240]   and so that's been just a feature of my life
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.640]   since I've had those kinds of feelings.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.840]   So I've been trying to think through
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.240]   what is the best way of articulating that as a Christian?
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.160]   Obviously, in our secular culture,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.240]   the language people would typically and obviously use
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.000]   would be to say, "Well, I'm gay."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.600]   But in my own experience, that kind of language
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380]   tends to be used to express not just a description
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.840]   of what kind of sexual feelings you have,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.200]   but it tends to me to be someone's identity.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.520]   So it's an indication of who you are.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.360]   And as a Christian, one of the key things for me
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320]   is realizing that identity for Christians
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.080]   is not something that we either discover in ourselves,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.120]   it's not something we create,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.080]   it's something we receive and are given
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.360]   by the only person who can know our actual identity,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.120]   which is the God who made us.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200]   So my identity as a Christian comes from the fact
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.160]   that I've been created by God and redeemed by him
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.440]   through the saving work of Jesus.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.120]   So this is where I need to have a different understanding
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.080]   to our culture.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.200]   Our culture says you are your sexuality,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.640]   that the sexual feelings you have,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.000]   that is you at your most you,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.160]   that is the real you.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.280]   Whereas for me, that's just not the case.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.880]   And so I want to use language that can describe
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.280]   an aspect of what is going on in my life,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.720]   but which doesn't imply that that is what defines me
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.680]   or what kind of is the center and heart of who I am.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.480]   So the language of same-sex attraction
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.120]   perhaps is less familiar to people
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.400]   outside of Christian circles sometimes.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.920]   It's a bit more clunky,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.000]   but I think I feel like it's less prone
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.160]   to being misunderstood.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.280]   I don't want to imply that a particular set
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.120]   of sexual temptations is where I see who I am.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.680]   It's not the lens through which I understand myself.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.640]   So that's why I tend to use the language
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.800]   of being same-sex attracted.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.880]   One potential downside of that is people can think
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.120]   I'm saying that there's a kind of neutrality
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.320]   to those attractions.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.560]   I'm certainly not saying that.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.600]   I'm not saying it's the equivalent of being left-handed
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.960]   or having blonde hair or something like that.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.440]   All I'm saying is that the particular form
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.160]   of a sexual temptation I experience
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.240]   is this particular kind.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.560]   All of us are fallen in this area of life.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.080]   All of us experience disordered desires
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.600]   that affects our sexual desires as well.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.960]   So all of us are sexual sinners.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.840]   This is the particular way in which that's fallenness
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.080]   works its way out in my life.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.920]   And so I tend to use that language.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.080]   I think no language is perfect on this issue
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.960]   and whatever language you use
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.560]   is going to be misunderstood by someone.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.840]   But I found this has been helpful for me.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.640]   A couple of other just quick thoughts on that.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.240]   One is that there have been times if I'm,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.560]   a couple of times that people in the secular media
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.920]   have wanted to interview me
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.440]   about my own kind of position on this.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.440]   There have been times, maybe three or four times,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.680]   when I have used the language of being gay
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.280]   simply because I'm either talking to someone
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.120]   in the secular world who just is not gonna understand
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.840]   the language of same-sex attraction
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.680]   or I'm talking to an unbelieving friend
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.080]   or something like that.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.800]   So there are times when I felt I needed to use
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.000]   the language of being gay in order to have the conversation
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.120]   and then I've immediately qualified what I've meant by it.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.240]   Some may say that's an inappropriate thing to do.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640]   That's just the kind of way it's landed.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.440]   It's not my preferred way of speaking.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.560]   I see it as sort of parallel to when Paul appeals
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.880]   to his Roman citizenship.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.160]   It's something that opens a door for his ministry,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.600]   but it's certainly not how he sees himself.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.960]   I think the other thing just to say on that
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.000]   is that I think there's a difference
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.880]   between language as a starting point
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.200]   and language as an intended destination.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.000]   I think people who come to faith from the LGBT+ community,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.600]   the most natural language they're gonna instinctively use
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.800]   is to say, "Oh, I belong to gay Christian."
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.960]   And I think that's a very understandable starting point.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.040]   It wouldn't be where I'd want them to finally land
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.440]   in terms of the language they use,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.960]   but I wouldn't wanna jump up and down
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.280]   on a new or young Christian just for using that language
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.800]   as if it's only ever always wrong
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.920]   'cause they may just not have had a chance
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.240]   to kind of think that kind of thing through yet.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.600]   - Yeah, interesting.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.760]   And then the question over whether homosexual desires
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   are merely temptations or is same-sex attraction itself
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.720]   as an orientation sinful in and of itself.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   So I think it's rather easy to agree
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.480]   that a heterosexual man who commits adultery
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.920]   with a woman has sinned.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.200]   They've both sinned.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.480]   We get that.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.720]   And a homosexual man acting on that impulse
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.040]   with another man has sinned.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.160]   They both have sinned.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.800]   I think we get that.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.560]   Then moving back one step to the level of desire,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.920]   a heterosexual man desiring to commit adultery
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.360]   with a particular woman is sinning in his imagination.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   And a homosexual man desiring sex
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.160]   with one particular man is also sinning in his imagination.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.520]   I think we get that.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.120]   But then you work this back one more level
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.680]   to what is commonly called orientation.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.840]   Then the heterosexual man who is attracted
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.160]   to women generally is not sinning.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.440]   But a homosexual man attracted to men generally
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.160]   remains in a state of sin, or does he?
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.840]   That seems to be the debate among Christians right now.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.440]   How do you process this debate
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.880]   at the quote-unquote orientation level?
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.800]   - Yes, it's a tricky issue
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.840]   because people often use certain terms
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.880]   in slightly different ways to one another.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.600]   And so the language of this same-sex attraction itself,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.640]   sinful, is tricky because it depends exactly
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.240]   what we're meaning by same-sex attraction.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.480]   Are we talking about the actual act of desire
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   or are we talking about the capacity for that desire?
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.560]   I'm not sure the language of orientation
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.520]   always serves us well.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.680]   It's a very secular concept.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.680]   I think its limits are that it implies a kind of fixity
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.240]   that I'm not sure is always the case
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.760]   with our sexual feelings.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.920]   And just that calling it an orientation
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.600]   implies it's the vantage point from which you see the world.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.120]   That it's kind of, again, it's implying it's central
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.800]   to who you are.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.560]   However, we do need some kind of language
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.720]   to describe the general shape
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.280]   of our feelings and our temptation.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.040]   So it's good to have some way of describing that.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.200]   I think there are two things
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.880]   we need to distinguish between.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.280]   I think often when people talk about
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.240]   acting on desires, they're often meaning
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.240]   physically acting on those desires.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.720]   As you've just alluded to, Jesus makes it very clear
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.600]   that it's our hearts and our attitudes
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.520]   as much as our actual physical behavior
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.040]   that we need to think through.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.200]   You don't have to act on something physically
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.880]   for it to be sinful.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.840]   So that tells me that sexual sin needs to be fought
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.960]   in our hearts and minds.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.840]   It's not enough to be not physically acting on it
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.040]   if we're mentally acting on it.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.800]   And in fact, we're not gonna be likely
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   to physically resist a sin
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.480]   if we've been mentally rehearsing for it.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.640]   So people often say it's okay
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.920]   provided you don't act on it.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.360]   I wanna say, yes, kind of,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.480]   as long as we're including mental acts
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.880]   in our language of acting on it.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.360]   I think the other thing we need to remember
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.040]   is there is a distinction between temptation and sin.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.600]   We see that in the Bible, in the Lord's Prayer,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.640]   we need to be delivered from our temptations,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.800]   but we need to be forgiven for our sins.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.360]   James chapter one reminds us
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.800]   that temptation gives birth to sin.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.280]   It's not itself sin.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.040]   And so the two are not the same thing.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.120]   When we're tempted, we need to flee temptation
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.640]   and to stand faithfully underneath it.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.440]   And I take it it's possible, therefore,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.200]   to be tempted without sinning.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.920]   We're not told that as we grow as Christians,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.000]   temptations will just disappear from life.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.920]   We are promised that God will enable us
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.240]   to stand under temptation.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   And so I think I wanna say that the presence of temptation
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   is not itself a sin.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.200]   So James one tells me that when I experience temptation,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.400]   I shouldn't blame God.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.800]   I shouldn't say, well, that's God's fault
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.400]   that I'm tempted in this way.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.520]   I need to recognize the ways in which my own temptations
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.720]   are a reflection of my fallen nature.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.600]   They come from my own desires.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.120]   But I don't think it's right to say
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   that having the capacity to be tempted is itself a sin.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.600]   It's a sign of our fallenness,
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   but I want to repent of the ways
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.680]   I sinfully respond to temptation,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.200]   and I want to flee temptation itself.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.520]   Otherwise, you're saying to someone,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.280]   even if you're not sinning, you're still sinning,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.840]   and just because you've got the capacity
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.960]   to be tempted in a certain way.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.720]   But I think you're right to suggest
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.120]   that there's not an exact symmetry
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.240]   between same-sex temptation and opposite-sex feelings
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.600]   because there are godly ways
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.720]   of expressing heterosexual sexual desires.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.840]   There are not godly ways
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.200]   of expressing homosexual sexual desires.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.360]   So in that sense, there's a distinction between the two.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.520]   But at the same time, I wouldn't want us to lose sight
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.640]   of the way there's much in common between the two.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   So I don't want people who are experiencing
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.160]   same-sex temptation to feel as though
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.680]   they must be complete monsters
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.880]   compared to all the people
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.760]   who are wrestling with heterosexual temptation.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.600]   We know that, again, all of us are fallen
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.520]   in this area of life.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.480]   All of us need to put sinful desires to death.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.920]   All of us need to flee temptation,
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.440]   and actually, all of us need encouragement
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.960]   and help to do that.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.800]   - Thank you, Sam.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.200]   I appreciate your willingness
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.920]   to dive into the deep end of this debate,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.400]   and it doesn't resolve everything,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   but it does offer us a helpful place
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.840]   to begin this conversation
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.920]   and to onboard folks who maybe aren't aware of it.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.760]   So thank you.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.320]   Thank you for this introduction.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.920]   That was Sam Mulberry speaking with us
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.200]   from his office in Oxford,
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.800]   and this debate over the language
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.920]   of how we talk about same-sex attraction
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.080]   is really important,
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.520]   and it's part of an ongoing debate
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.160]   among brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.880]   But one of the more settled realities
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.560]   that is countercultural in this culture for sure
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.960]   is the fact that human identity is not defined
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.840]   by our sexual expression,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.280]   and that's exactly what we learn
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.920]   from the full humanity of Jesus,
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.640]   which is the topic we return to on Monday
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.720]   with our guest and friend Sam Mulberry.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.080]   Don't miss this one on Monday.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.320]   Have a great weekend, and we'll see you then.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.480]   (silence)
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.640]   (silence)
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.800]   (silence)
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.860]   you
