[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.580]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.320]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.220]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and if you're new here, I'm a diehard optimizer who
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.940]   loves doing all the research to get the best experience in life
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.740]   without an expensive price tag.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.980]   Most weeks, I sit down with the world's best to learn the strategies, tactics,
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.940]   and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.060]   But today, I'm doing another mailbag episode where I'm
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.740]   answering all your questions.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.000]   A few months ago, I explained how I was going to cycle through the
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.760]   next three episodes like this, first focusing on credit card points and
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.080]   miles, then on money and investing, and finally on life, work, non-points
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.480]   travel, and anything else you wanted to send my way, and you guys certainly
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920]   sent in a lot of questions, so here's how this is going to unfold.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.900]   First, I'll cover a bunch of great travel questions about local tours,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.000]   jet lag, cruises, travel insurance, language barriers, finding hotel rooms
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.400]   for five people, comparing French Polynesia to the Seychelles, and I'll
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.680]   also share two great hacks for airplane Wi-Fi and getting global entry appointments.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.900]   Then I'll touch on a few follow-up questions to the recent episodes I did
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.840]   on security, about virtual credit cards, managing family information, and password
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.720]   managers that don't store data in the cloud, and for the rest, I don't really
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.120]   have a category, but I'll cover some food hacks, my favorite podcasts, how I
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.800]   take notes while listening, how I feel these days about my Peloton, cell phone
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.160]   insurance from your credit cards, virtual assistance, and how I try to avoid
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.600]   getting overwhelmed with all this optimizing.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.880]   Now, if you're one of the dozen or so people who sent in some parenting
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   questions and are thinking, "Where's my question on that list?"
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.640]   The answer is, it's not there on purpose, and that's because there's more than
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.480]   enough content to fill a whole episode, so Amy and I are going to co-host an
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.360]   episode all about the parenting hacks, tips, learnings, purchases, and more
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.240]   we've used for our two kids.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.000]   So if you have, or one day want to have kids, then know that that's
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   coming, and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.520]   And if you're further along on the journey than we are, I would love it
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.480]   if you could send any thoughts, advice, or parenting hacks you have to both
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.040]   of us soon so that we can incorporate them into the episode and that
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.480]   we can use them in our lives.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.280]   Also, in the last month, it seems that the world is really coming back
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.120]   because I've ended up going to three conferences, and then we also had a
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.240]   week where our au pair was on vacation and had no childcare, so I am still
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.720]   playing catch up, but if you've sent me an email and haven't heard back from
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960]   me in over a month, please follow up.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.480]   It's entirely possible that I mistakenly archived the email, and
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   I'm sure I would love to respond.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   Okay, one last thing.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.000]   I just want to address a review I got last week in the Apple
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.160]   Podcasts app from Mooper Dumpling.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   They said, "There is a lot of advertising throughout that makes it
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.680]   seem like you are more interested in making money off this program
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   than for any other reason."
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.040]   Look, I can't change the perception any of you have, but I will say two things.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.960]   First, I can tell you with certainty that the reason I'm doing this podcast is
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.720]   because I love having these conversations with guests, I love sharing that with you,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.520]   I love doing research to do solo episodes, and I love helping you all
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.360]   upgrade and optimize your lives.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.600]   In fact, the only reason I started working with sponsors was because
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.720]   I love doing this so much, I wanted to be able to grow it to the point
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.040]   that I could do it full-time or even hire people that could help it be even better.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.760]   As for there being a lot of advertising, from all the research I've done and
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.920]   the conversations I've had with podcasters and networks, shows of this
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.280]   length typically have four to eight ads.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.560]   In fact, I considered joining a big podcast network, but there
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.880]   were two big reasons I didn't.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.080]   One, they required me to increase to 10 to 12 ads per episode,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.120]   which I thought seemed crazy.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.520]   And they wanted some of those ads to be programmatic, which meant I
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.000]   wouldn't have any control of the brands that were advertising on the show.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.480]   And because I only want to work with brands that I love, or if I don't know
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.280]   them that well, I've at least done a ton of homework on them and talked
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.400]   to others who have used them, which wouldn't be possible at a network.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   And for me today means that I say no to a lot of brands, some that have
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.680]   even offered a lot of money.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.120]   So I've capped it at four ads per episode, split across two breaks,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.160]   except for those shorter bonus episodes, which have fewer.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.320]   So I feel good that we're at a below average number of ads, but one
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   option I've considered to mitigate breaking up the content twice would
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.960]   be to move two of those ads each episode to be pre-rolls at the very
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.800]   beginning before the episode starts.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.720]   So you might hear me testing that in the future.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.920]   And if you have an opinion, let me know.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.400]   And Mooper Dumpling, if you're listening and I've convinced you at all, feel
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.320]   free to update your rating or anyone else, feel free to drop another five
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.600]   star rating or review to help balance it out.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.520]   Okay.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.880]   Thanks for hearing me out.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.280]   It's well past time to get to the episode.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.160]   So let's get started.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.720]   Okay.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   First question.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.800]   I love your podcast.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200]   Your travel hacks are my favorite.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.720]   Can you please do an episode comparing Bora Bora and the Seychelles?
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.520]   We've been to French Polynesia, but haven't done the Seychelles.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.920]   Would love to hear the difference.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.840]   So I don't think I can fill an episode, but here's my take.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.680]   Both are absolutely incredible and I wouldn't pass up an opportunity to do
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.520]   either, but there are some really big differences, first off, depending on
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.600]   where you live, one might be significantly easier to get to than the other.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.120]   For us on the West coast, the Seychelles was a long flight to Paris and then a
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.680]   long flight to the Seychelles that actually ended up getting canceled.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.600]   So we had to fly through Dubai.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   So we're talking a significant investment in your time just to get there.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.240]   Whereas from San Francisco, you can fly direct to Papiete and take a
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.400]   really short flight over to Bora Bora.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.960]   So just getting to French Polynesia is so much easier, but
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.120]   what are the main differences?
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.400]   So when it comes to beaches, the Seychelles beaches are unbelievable.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.880]   They are the most picturesque, beautiful beaches I've seen in the entire world.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.440]   And in Bora Bora, it's much more about the overwater bungalow.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   The water is so clear.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.200]   It's so beautiful, but I don't actually remember spending a lot of time on them.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.320]   And the beaches definitely aren't as beautiful and picturesque
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   as they are in the Seychelles.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.720]   Another thing, when you get to Bora Bora and keep in mind, I haven't spent a lot
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.520]   of time in the rest of French Polynesia.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.200]   So I'm going to focus on Bora Bora.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.680]   You arrive at the airport and from the airport, you get on a boat that's
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.080]   maybe a hundred feet from baggage claim that takes you straight to your hotel.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.800]   So it's much more of an isolated experience.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   In fact, the first time we went, we went to the main island on Bora Bora
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.600]   and we walked around and it didn't really feel like a city center.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.840]   It felt like there was a little store, a market, a bunch of
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.080]   diamond shops, some tourism stuff.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.120]   A couple of restaurants, but there wasn't a lot going on.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.680]   Whereas going downtown in the Seychelles, there was a food market.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.480]   There was all kinds of stuff happening.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.320]   Locals mixing with travelers.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.320]   It was really, really interesting.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.280]   And I felt like you could really immerse yourself in what was going on there.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.320]   And it was just because the main island is much bigger and easier to get around.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.360]   I felt like going to the Seychelles, you really get to experience the country more.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.240]   Now, I'm sure if I stayed in the main island of Tahiti and I spent a bunch of
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.160]   time there, I would have a similar experience.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.480]   So I would say, take this all with a grain of salt, but a lot of the really
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.040]   amazing five-star experiences that you'd have in the Seychelles are on the main
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.240]   island, whereas in French Polynesia, a lot of them are on Bora Bora or maybe
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.120]   on another island, so I think that you can do one place easier in the Seychelles
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.800]   and get that experience without feeling like you're hopping between islands.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.080]   That said, I don't personally remember from our trip, and maybe it's the
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.040]   time, a really distinct, unique culture in the Seychelles like I
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.360]   did going to French Polynesia.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.560]   There is a very unique Polynesian culture that most of the hotels try to
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.880]   infuse in one of the nights of the week and the experience, and that really
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.400]   stuck with me, which is something that didn't happen in the Seychelles.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.000]   Now, maybe that's my fault for not immersing myself in it, but it wasn't
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.440]   something that felt like it was a common thread through everything you do.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.880]   Most of the hotels in the Seychelles, at least all of the ones that we saw and
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.800]   looked at, were just normal, kind of luxury, beautiful hotels, but there
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.120]   weren't these overwater bungalows.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.400]   So if you're going for that experience, I think that's where you want to go.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.720]   So ultimately for me, it comes down to if you're trying to relax and you
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.920]   don't really want to do anything other than sit at a hotel and you live on
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.160]   the West Coast or probably anywhere in the States, Bora Bora, I think is a
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.720]   much easier trip, but if you want to see something totally different and
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.520]   you're willing to take a long trip, or maybe you're based in Europe or
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   Africa or Asia, the Seychelles is definitely worth checking out.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.360]   Just know that you're not getting that overwater bungalow experience.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.000]   If you live in that part of the world and you want to go on an overwater
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.720]   bungalow, it seems like Maldives is your place.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.880]   I've never been, but it's certainly on my list.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   And I think something that when the kids are older or when we can escape
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   for another week, we might consider it.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.280]   But right now traveling halfway around the world just seems like a much bigger
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.720]   ordeal than it did two years ago when we didn't have kids.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.320]   Speaking of kids, Jesse wrote in a question asking if I had any tips for
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.800]   hotels when traveling with a family of five.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.720]   It looks like most hotels have a four-person limit on rooms, and the
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.120]   only workaround Jesse found was to book two rooms or book a two-bedroom
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.280]   suite, which can be really expensive.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.880]   He asked, is there anything, whether it's a loyalty program or
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.040]   some deal to make that possible?
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.200]   So I thought about this a lot and I even asked a friend in the industry.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.480]   His advice was that if your kids are under six, you can kind of just
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.920]   sneak them in and not worry about it.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.600]   When we were in Hawaii recently, we asked the hotel to bring in a rollaway
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.960]   bed and a crib and they were willing to do both, so you could have fit two
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.200]   people on each of the two queen beds and then two kids in the rollaway and the
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.480]   crib, but the problem is that when you book online and the hotel asks, they
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.280]   won't let you book that room if you have more than four people.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.960]   So I'd say call the hotel.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.160]   It never hurts to call and say, "Hey, is it possible to do this?"
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.640]   Because you might get a different answer.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.840]   Or maybe that's a great circumstance for an Airbnb because most Airbnbs
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.440]   don't have a capacity on the number of people like hotels do.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.640]   I don't want to speak to the legality of bringing extra kids in, sneaking
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.040]   them in, but I will say that physically, I think those people will fit.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.960]   Maybe read the reviews, maybe call the hotel and see what you can do.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.120]   If anyone has any other tips for this question or really any of the
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.440]   questions today, send them in.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.400]   I'd love to share them.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.000]   Okay.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.120]   Johnny wrote in asking for advice or hacks on deals for cruises.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.880]   And honestly, I don't have a good answer here, but I wanted to still
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.120]   bring it up on this episode because if enough people are interested in
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.440]   cruises, I might make a whole episode on it.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.000]   I've only been on one cruise and somehow I both liked it and haven't been on
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.800]   another, but I feel like once our kids are getting a little older, it's worth
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:18.640]   trying again and there is a whole range of cruises from the most crazy Disney
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.760]   family carnival kind of cruises you think of all the way to, I remember
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.240]   seeing Instagram posts from Ramit Sethi of the most beautiful luxury cruise in
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.760]   Japan that ever since I saw, I've been very interested in going on.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.640]   So the whole topic of cruises is something that I think I'm fascinated by.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.480]   My parents recently did this amazing wine country cruise down a river in France.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.200]   So there's just a whole lot to this whole space that I don't know.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.920]   So if this is an interesting topic to you and you think it's worth digging
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.800]   in, you can shoot me a quick note and I'll start doing some homework.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.920]   Okay, Todd wrote in asking he'd love to travel to many far away locations
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.280]   away from typical tourist areas, but his concern was being stuck or
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.920]   stumped by the language barrier.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.960]   And that's kept him from being more adventurous.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.920]   He doesn't speak another language beyond English and wanted to know what
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.880]   I suggest or how I've dealt with this.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.920]   So honestly, I don't really worry about it at all.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.280]   When Amy and I were backpacking for seven and a half months, we were doing
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.800]   most of our travel by land and we ended up in some very rural places in Africa,
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.760]   in India, in Southeast Asia, and in the Middle East, and I found a few things.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:34.600]   First, you can communicate a lot with very, very few, if not zero words.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.120]   Your hand gestures, pointing pictures, like you'd be surprised.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.160]   And in some cases, when we first got to Aleppo in Syria, um, we were lost.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.360]   We weren't sure where we were going.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.400]   Someone came up to us.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.800]   They didn't speak English and they picked out their cell phone and they
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.840]   called someone who did that helped translate between the two of us so that
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.560]   the person we ran into could actually help us find where we were going.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.960]   And they were so excited to talk to us, even though we couldn't actually
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.360]   communicate, that they insisted that we stop by their home and have a coffee
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.840]   and get to meet their family, which we did the entire time,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.560]   not speaking the same language.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   So I think if you just embrace that the experience is something different
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.680]   than necessarily having a conversation, I think you can have an incredible
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.120]   time and there's almost always some common ground.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.440]   I think one of the great things about the English language is that so much
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.800]   of music, so much of media and culture is done in English that even if someone
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.440]   doesn't speak it fluently, you might be able to get across a few things.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.800]   I think the other thing that I see sometimes when we're traveling is that
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.280]   people who speak English are trying to speak English in another country, the
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.400]   same way they speak it in the States.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.360]   You have to learn a whole different version of slower and
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.200]   kind of more simplified English.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.080]   If you want to be really successful, having a conversation with people who
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.040]   don't speak English as their first language.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.960]   So I would just say, learn to be very patient, learn to speak slow, learn
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.040]   to break things down in a much more simple way than using the entire
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.120]   vocabulary you might use back home.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.640]   And I think you can go anywhere and make it work.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.120]   Does it help to have a phone with Google Translate if you're in a bind?
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.620]   Sure.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.920]   Does it help to learn a few phrases every time you're entering a new
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.760]   country so that you can kind of at least feel like you're making an effort also?
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.720]   Absolutely.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.360]   I feel like I still know how to say hello and how are you and please and
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.120]   excuse me in like 10, 15 languages, even though that's the extent of
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.680]   the entire language that I know.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.520]   So I would say, don't let this get in the way.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.200]   If all that fails and you don't feel like that's enough, you could always
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.080]   try to hire a local translator or guide.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.080]   I'm sure you can find someone or take a free walking tour whenever you
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.680]   get to the city and see if that person might know someone if you
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.080]   don't know how to find them online.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.960]   I feel like there are enough options that language barrier should never be
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.400]   the reason that you don't go somewhere.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.040]   Okay.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.880]   Georgina wrote in about how she'd love to take a trip at the end of the year,
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.600]   but the worker who's helping take care of one of her family members recently
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.480]   left, and she wants to make sure she can find a replacement before then.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.640]   So she didn't know whether she should buy the ticket now, wait, or consider
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.600]   cancel for any reason, travel insurance.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   So this is a tough one, but I have a few thoughts partially because we
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.040]   looked at taking this new airline zip air to get to Japan because they
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.160]   had ridiculously cheap flights from LA.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.440]   And the only downside was they have a fully non-refundable ticket.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.840]   So unlike most of the U S airlines where yes, it's non-refundable,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.120]   but you can still get a credit.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.720]   Um, this was fully non-refundable zero back, except maybe your taxes.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.240]   So we thought about it.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.000]   And then we also looked at cancel for any reason, travel insurance,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.720]   which I had never purchased before.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.560]   What I learned is it's not that much more expensive than regular travel insurance.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.520]   It's usually about one and a half to two times the cost of a regular
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.560]   travel insurance policy, which might be 5% of your trip and it covers
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.400]   you like it says for any reason.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.720]   So if your flight is non-refundable and you have to cancel it, they're
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.880]   going to reimburse you, but they usually don't reimburse a hundred percent.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.600]   It's usually around 75%.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.440]   So there's still a cost.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.280]   And this is where some of the data on Google flights, where they look
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.120]   at, you know, what an average fare is.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.600]   If you figure, if you have to cancel this, you're going to end up paying
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.400]   25% plus maybe other five to 10 for the travel policy.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.440]   So a third of the cost, you're not going to get back.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.440]   If it looks like the average airfare for this flight or the hotels or whatever
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.120]   it is, might end up costing two X.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.080]   If you wait to book it, then it might be a really good deal instead of waiting.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.080]   However, don't forget that if you book with a lot of the domestic
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.280]   US airlines and you can look into this for international airlines.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.920]   If you have to cancel that trip, you can usually get a credit back.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.200]   Now that credit usually only works on that airline,
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.560]   sometimes with their partners.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.960]   So I would say if I were going that path, I'd really prioritize an
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.920]   airline that I thought I'd be able to use in the next year or two so that
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.880]   I could take advantage of that credit, not lose it, or if you're listening
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.840]   to the show and you have miles, most airlines, if you book with miles
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.120]   and cancel, you will be able to get all your miles back and maybe pay
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.840]   a award redeposit fee is what they're often called a fee to
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.240]   cancel and put those miles back.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.560]   So I'd say the best move you can do if you have points or miles is to book
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.720]   with miles, know that if you're transferring those miles to an airline
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.640]   like Air France or Turkish Air, you're going to get those miles back in that
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.000]   program, but that doesn't mean you can't use them to book a flight on United
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.480]   or on Delta or on, you know, American, depending on who the partners are.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.320]   So if it were me and I was in a situation where I thought there was a good
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.800]   chance, I'd have to cancel the trip.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   I'd first try to book it with miles.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.720]   I then look at the data about what happens with the airfare.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.640]   And I'd consider waiting if the airfare doesn't look like it usually
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.520]   gets significantly more expensive.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.320]   One quick thought was we were just in Hawaii and it turns out that our
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.680]   flight times changed so much that we were going to get back way after
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.120]   bedtime and two days before flying home, I looked and I could cancel our
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.160]   United flight for free because of the schedule change and I booked another
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.040]   flight on Alaska that got in earlier.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.640]   And I actually saved money because the fares were cheaper.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.160]   So last minute isn't always more expensive, even if you're paying with
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.960]   dollars, but if you don't want to take that risk and you want to lock it in
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.880]   now, maybe there's an incredible fare.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.240]   I would consider cancel for any reason travel insurance, but just know that
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.760]   you're not going to get back the full fare and if the airline, when you try
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.840]   to cancel offers you a credit and you take that credit, you're almost certainly
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.800]   not going to get the travel insurance to cover you.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.040]   So I'm almost positive that you have to refuse any credits.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.640]   The airline offers you when you cancel in order to get
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.800]   reimbursed by travel insurance.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.320]   But obviously read the fine print, call the travel insurance company.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.000]   I am not always the expert on every single policy.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.520]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.240]   And that's thanks to Viori and I'm excited to be partnering
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.480]   with them for this episode.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.200]   They make performance apparel.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.800]   That's incredibly versatile.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.160]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.880]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.680]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.760]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.600]   wearing right now, unless you're wearing Viori, in which case
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.720]   you already know what I mean.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.520]   And it's not just for men.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.280]   My wife is as obsessed with Viori as I am.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.960]   My favorite is the Sunday performance joggers.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.840]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.480]   comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.840]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.760]   it's running, training, or yoga.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.080]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their meta
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.960]   pants can even work for a night out.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.360]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.

[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.560]   in the link in the show notes.

[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.000]   comfortable and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.480]   In today's internet age, people's personal information is being shared
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.560]   online with the click of a button without their consent, and it happens all the time.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.240]   But you can tackle this problem thanks to Delete Me from Abine, and I am excited to
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.040]   be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.440]   When I used to Google myself, I would find hundreds of detailed profiles
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.920]   sharing my cell phone number, address, email, family members, and a lot more.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.520]   At first, I actually tried to remove it all myself, which you can do, but after
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.440]   at least 10 hours, I signed up for Delete Me and it was so much easier.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.840]   Their software and team of experts will not just find and remove your personal
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.720]   information from hundreds of data broker websites, but they'll continuously scan
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.400]   for new data that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.200]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes over 2,000 pieces of data for a
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.080]   customer in their first two years.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.800]   So if you want to get your personal information removed from search results
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.840]   on the web, go to allthehacks.com/delete-me and get 20% off a plan
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   for you or your entire family.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.960]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/delete-me.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.880]   Okay.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.920]   While we're talking about big trips, Deidre wrote in, "I listen to the
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.560]   podcast regularly, I really enjoy it.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.000]   We're new to credit card points and love how it opens up all these options.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.520]   She has a big international trip coming next year.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.920]   It's the first one, and she's crossing seven time zones and
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.720]   wanted to know my hacks for jet lag."
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.280]   So thank you so much for listening and congrats on your first international trip.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.960]   I am so excited for you.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.880]   You're right.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.960]   We haven't done an episode on jet lag, but it's a great question.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.520]   So here are some of my tips.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.200]   I always try to get on the new time zone as much as possible, factoring in what
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.000]   I think is going to happen on the flight.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.160]   So if we had a 10-hour flight leaving San Francisco at 4 p.m.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.200]   to London, which is eight hours ahead and it lands at 1030 in the morning, I want
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.720]   to try to be able to sleep for about six hours on that flight so that when I land,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   I feel refreshed enough to make it through the whole day, which means I need
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.480]   to be tired when I'm getting on this flight at 4 p.m.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.240]   So I'm going to try to go to bed super early the night before,
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.640]   maybe even two nights before.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.760]   I'm going to force myself to wake up really early in the morning so that
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.400]   I get tired by the afternoon.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.040]   And if your schedule permits, you could even try to completely
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.640]   switch to the time zone before.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.520]   I know it's a little tricky when it comes to, you know, work
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.200]   schedules and light outdoors.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.760]   But one app that I've heard so many great things about, but I haven't
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.360]   used yet, is called Time Shifter.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.440]   So I would definitely check that app out.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.320]   It's literally built just for this.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.680]   You can go in and tell them your travel plans, where you're going, and they're
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.440]   going to propose a way to schedule your days in advance of that flight.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.240]   So you can arrive and get as close as you can to that new time zone and
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.120]   avoid jet lag as much as possible.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.760]   A few other things that I always try to do.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.600]   I try to stay really hydrated and I try to avoid caffeine
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.760]   and alcohol on the flight.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.640]   I know sometimes you're using all these points in your fine business class and
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.800]   they're offering you all this free champagne, and it feels crazy for
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   me to sometimes just decline it.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.640]   And look, if you're celebrating your honeymoon, go for it.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.560]   But I really try to avoid those things as much as possible so I can get the
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.280]   right sleep so I can make sure to hit the ground running and not
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.080]   lose a day or two of jet lag.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.600]   A few other things.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.920]   When I'm in a new destination, I try to be outside as much as possible so
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.520]   I can let sunlight do its thing.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.280]   And I really try to avoid taking a nap, even if I'm tired the first day or two.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   I remember when we got to Budapest, we thought, "Oh, what if we just
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.720]   take a one-hour nap?"
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.200]   And we laid down at like two in the afternoon and we ended up sleeping
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.720]   for six hours and it was a total mess.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.520]   So last thing, I've heard wonders about taking melatonin and that helping
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.240]   regulate your sleep cycle and getting you back on track hasn't been something
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.320]   I've needed to try, but definitely worth considering if you're really worried.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.280]   So once you're in your destination, Pat wrote in asking about the kind
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.320]   of food tours that I mentioned I love doing when we get to a new city.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.960]   Something he's really excited to do when he gets to Barcelona and wanted
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.440]   to know whether I just jump into any group tour, whether I book a private
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.160]   one, and trying to figure out what's legit and what's not, what sites and
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.680]   services to check out, and how to make sure he's going to take a great tour.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.080]   So for me, I actually like taking small group tours more than a
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.800]   private tour because I get a chance to meet people that have maybe
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.280]   been in the city for a few days.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.200]   They have some experiences to share.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.960]   Part of why I love traveling is meeting new people.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.280]   Many times I've met people that are from other countries and I've learned a
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.200]   little bit about where they're from and it's sparked new ideas for future trips.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   At least 50% of the time we've done a group tour, we've actually ended up
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.040]   hanging out or having drinks with the people we've met on the tour.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.200]   And sometimes like multiple times, some of them we've even
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   stayed in touch with for years.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.400]   But sometimes a private tour is a better fit for what we want.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   Maybe it's the schedule.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.040]   Maybe we want to do something really different.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.800]   Maybe we want to work a few different things in, or maybe we just
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.240]   can't find what we're looking for.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.280]   But when we're looking for stuff, I book tours on with locals
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.680]   and had a good experience on Airbnb.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.720]   Peak.com, I think has some tours.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.080]   You can find them on TripAdvisor, but I just try to make
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.720]   sure I read all the reviews.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.320]   There are private tour companies, which can be great, but
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.240]   they can also be so expensive.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.200]   If you find someone that's a local writer, you can oftentimes email them.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   Maybe they write for a newspaper and ask them if they'd be willing to set up a
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.600]   tour, if they know anyone, or if you get to a city and you take a free walking
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.440]   tour, you can always ask that person.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.120]   Many people in the tourism industry know a lot of the other
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.440]   people in that same industry.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.360]   So you can kind of network your way there.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.800]   But honestly, if I look at all the tours we've ever taken, we've
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.480]   only had one bad experience.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.440]   And it was so easy to fix because we just bailed on the tour halfway through.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.120]   It was a tour we booked of the Acropolis in Greece, and it ended up
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.600]   being just way too deep in history.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.600]   And we were just not interested.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.360]   And it was so hot that we just kind of said, "We're run out of time.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.080]   We've got to run."
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:09.760]   And we called it.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.680]   I think if I had read more reviews, I probably would have come to that
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.400]   conclusion, but we'd booked a few tours on with locals that had gone so well.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.600]   I think I just went with it.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.880]   But yeah, I'd say read the reviews and go in with an open mind.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.360]   And I feel like it will be a great experience almost every time.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.400]   Before I wrap up travel, two hacks that I love.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   So one, if you have T-Mobile, and this will work if it's a close
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.160]   family member, friend, your spouse.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.920]   There are some airlines, Alaska being one of them, where T-Mobile
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.800]   will get you free internet, but it's almost always on mobile only.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   So if you open up on your iPhone or your Android, it'll say, "Oh, sign
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.480]   in with T-Mobile and get free internet."
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.160]   Well, if you're on your laptop, go into your browser and you can actually
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.840]   open up the developer tools on Chrome command option I, and
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.000]   you pull up this inspector.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.280]   Unless you want to go play with HTML and CSS, you don't need to use this,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.720]   but there's a little icon in the top left that looks like an
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.080]   iPhone on top of an iPad.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.880]   And if you click that, it actually shows you a view of what the website
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.440]   you're looking at looks like on mobile.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.120]   Well, what I found is that if you switch to that mobile view on your laptop,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.840]   you'll actually refresh the page and get the mobile version of the wifi portal.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.400]   And it'll say, if you have T-Mobile, you can log in and get free internet.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:30.320]   So I have a T-Mobile line with one gig of data that is like $20 a month that
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.720]   I use for international travel and free wifi.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.760]   So if I'm on my laptop, I do this.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.120]   I log in with my phone number and boom, free wifi on a computer.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.400]   It doesn't have to be on your phone.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.040]   So I would also consider asking any friends you have that are
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.320]   close if they have T-Mobile.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.240]   I know that when my wife's been traveling, I just give her my T-Mobile
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.600]   number and as long as I'm not flying the same day, it's really easy
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.280]   for her to use it to get wifi too.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.160]   Thank you T-Mobile for making this possible.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.440]   Don't delete my account.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.720]   So that's one hack that I love.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.560]   The other, I got a few requests in the last few months from people about what to do
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.760]   about getting a global entry appointment.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:11.160]   And I didn't have a good answer until we recently tried to get a global entry
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.880]   appointment for our four month old and realized it's almost impossible in some cities.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.400]   I went on and looked in San Francisco and it was literally, there are none.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.440]   And I was like, wow.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.360]   So I started looking online and someone says, keep refreshing the site for the San
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.080]   Francisco airport.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.400]   There was a Twitter account that posts when there's an appointment.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.960]   And then I found a site, Appointment Scanner, and it is amazing.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.560]   You know, those times where you find a product and you're just like, this is
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.360]   exactly the product I need for this circumstance.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   So I literally signed up for Appointment Scanner and for context, it's $29.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.640]   It's a one-time payment.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.080]   It's not a subscription.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.360]   You get alerts for a month.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.920]   And within a couple hours of signing up, I already had an appointment booked for
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.360]   our daughter the next month.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.680]   Over the course of the next few weeks, I left the appointment alerts running just
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.840]   so I could get a sense of how often things open up and it's crazy.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.800]   I was probably getting anywhere from three to 10 alerts a day of new
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.720]   appointments and almost all of them were in the next couple of months.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.880]   So big fan of Appointment Scanner.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.360]   If you need a global entry appointment, they send email alerts, text message
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.400]   alerts, and I would be so surprised if you couldn't get an appointment set up
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.560]   within a couple of weeks of using the product, if not a couple of days, and
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.640]   they have a 100% money back guarantee if you don't find anything.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.880]   So definitely check it out.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.320]   The only catch is, at least for San Francisco, you need to be ready to book
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.160]   that appointment within like a minute.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.880]   So if you're using a password manager, make sure your password's there.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.000]   I would even go as far as to kind of notice, is there a time of day where
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.600]   they seem to be posting them and log in to the Trusted Traveler Program site so
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.440]   you can get ready to snag that appointment.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.480]   But definitely check out Appointment Scanner.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.640]   I asked them if they had a deal for listeners because I wanted to give you
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.760]   guys one, they set me up with a link.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.240]   It'll help support the show if you sign up through there, but
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.680]   there's no special discount.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.520]   So you can go to allthehacks.com/globalentry if you want to help us
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.000]   out, but definitely consider Appointment Scanner if you need a global entry
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.680]   appointment, it was so good.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.560]   Moving on to security and identity protection and everything I
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.840]   talked about a few weeks ago.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.680]   I can't believe I left something off, but thank you, Jeff, for reminding me.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.040]   He reached out to let me know I forgot to talk about using virtual credit
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.800]   cards as a way not to spread your credit card number around the
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.120]   internet when you don't have to.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.360]   So he said that there's a lot of cards that do this now.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.880]   He's using the X1 card and really loving that feature.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.920]   I'm using my Adventure X card online, not just because I think it's a great card
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.280]   for earning points online at 2X points, but because Capital One has a browser
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.600]   extension, they call it Eno, and anytime you're checking out on a site, you can
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.920]   generate a virtual card number and you can set rules about when it expires.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.680]   And then you don't have to type your number online.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.120]   So I use that with Adventure X, it's great.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.480]   I highly recommend anytime you're on a website that is not something you want
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.720]   to trust for anything, using a virtual card number, if you don't have a card
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.520]   that supports it, there's an awesome site called privacy.com that will make it
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.720]   really easy to generate virtual card numbers, however, you have to pay for
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.160]   everything with privacy, with a bank account instead of your credit card.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.520]   So you're not going to earn points, you're not going to get purchase protection.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.920]   So I would say if you have the X1 card, like Jeff, you can do that.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.880]   If your card supports this already, you can do that.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:28.560]   If not, I think this is a great use for the Venture or the Venture X card because
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.560]   the Capital One browser extension is so simple.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.480]   My only complaint is that it hijacks command shift E, which is
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.640]   also centering text in Google Docs.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.200]   So I can no longer use a keyboard shortcut to center text in Google Docs.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.880]   Capital One, if you're listening, please give me an option to
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.040]   change the keyboard shortcut.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.320]   And if you don't have the Capital One Venture X or Venture card, and you want
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.120]   to, right now, they're still doing 75,000 point signup bonus, which is worth almost
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.440]   $1,500, and you can get that at allthehacks.com/cards if you want to
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.120]   support the show, Jason wrote in talking about Trustworthy, which I've had as a
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.240]   sponsor, and he wanted to know if I could go into a bit more detail about how I use
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.960]   it and what other systems might exist to protect all of the information and make
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.440]   sure family members have access to it.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.240]   He pointed out that $20 a month is a little expensive and wanted to know other
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.320]   options that might be better than his spreadsheet Google Doc system.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.600]   So as far as how to make it work and how to set it up and how access
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.040]   works, it's really simple.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.520]   And keep in mind, Trustworthy is no longer a sponsor of the show, but, you
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.160]   know, I am an investor, so I want a full disclosure, but it's really easy because
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.880]   you could just go in and add anyone in your family, and they have access, and
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.640]   you can also add anyone outside of your immediate family, and they can create an
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.560]   account that will give them the ability to get access if something ever happens
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.480]   to you, but it doesn't just give them access to everything in there.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.440]   They're effectively emergency contacts.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.560]   So setting up Trustworthy is super simple.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.120]   I believe they have a free trial, so you can go test it out.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:58.960]   I love it because it's just an organized way to find everything.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.440]   So we've got, you know, tax returns.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.160]   We've got a driver's license, insurance cards, the kind of stuff that it's just
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   like, "Oh, which Dropbox folder is it in?"
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.920]   So I really like the product.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.640]   Yes, it's not free.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.600]   And for me as a frugal person, it's been hard, but when I find products that just
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.880]   make my life simpler and help me feel good, I've become okay with just letting
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.360]   that be an expense that's something I'm comfortable with, but if you want an
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.960]   alternative, something that you could consider is putting everything in one
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.480]   password and giving the emergency kit to your one password to the people you
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.600]   want to have access to it.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.560]   It's not quite perfect because one, you have to give access to basically
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.120]   everything in your life to the same person, whereas on Trustworthy, you don't
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.200]   have to put everything in there if you don't want to.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.680]   The other thing, it's not really that organized, so maybe you have to create a
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.840]   secure note in your one password and tell someone how to use it, and you have to use
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.080]   some of their information types to, you know, store information or upload files
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.600]   that might be otherwise different, but I think it could work.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.640]   You could also put in a secure note that explains how to get through your
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.960]   Dropbox or your Google Drive, but I just found that Trustworthy laid it out
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.560]   really simply, we paid for a year, I think there's a lot of stuff they could do in
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.160]   the future and I hope they will, and I hope that maybe adds even more value and
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.200]   makes it an even easier decision for you.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.320]   There are also a bunch of other companies that do a similar product, and I signed up
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.920]   for trials for them, I can't remember all of them, but I just felt like Trustworthy
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.800]   did it better, which is why I ended up investing in the company.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:31.160]   And so, yeah, that's kind of how I've been thinking about it and why I'm willing to
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.840]   pay because I just want to be able to organize all this information, and they've
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.560]   been taking feedback really well, so there are some things that I suggested putting
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.320]   in there, like the contact info for all of the service providers, whether it's your
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.920]   cleaning person or your, you know, pest control, that's something they've recently
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.960]   added, so I just love seeing the product evolve and being kind of that central
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:58.200]   place to manage, not your schedule, not your family kind of day-to-day, but that
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.960]   bigger picture life organization stuff.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.680]   And despite that they're not sponsors, it looks like if you go to allthehacks.com/
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.640]   Trustworthy, you can still get 20% off.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.400]   So I don't know how long that will last, but it's still there right now.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.800]   Final one on security, Joanne was confused about password managers because she
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.360]   doesn't like her information being stored in the cloud, which one password used to
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.200]   not require and now does, and wanted to know if a password-protected Excel
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.360]   spreadsheet is enough.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.680]   She pointed out that she also travels with an encrypted flash drive.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.800]   Look, I'm not going to say it's not a good option, right?
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.880]   I know people that store their passwords in a note on the iPhone, so putting in a
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.000]   password-protected spreadsheet, especially now that Office has real encryption, is
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.200]   better than alternatives, but I still prefer using a password manager.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.320]   And if I wanted to keep everything local, I'd use KeePass.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.560]   It's open source.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.840]   I'll actually correct that.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.400]   I'd use KeePass XC.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.760]   KeePass is an open source password manager that stores everything locally.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.960]   I wouldn't say the user interface is as good as 1Password or some of the other
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.440]   products out there, but it is local.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.760]   So if that's what you want, I would definitely check it out.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.120]   It's been forked into different versions.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.320]   There was KeePass, then there was KeePass X, and then KeePass XC.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.960]   From all my research and everything I know, KeePass XC has the best apps
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.400]   that are the most user-friendly, so that's what I'd be using if I really cared
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.520]   about keeping everything stored locally.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.960]   All right, so that's security.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:25.240]   I want to jump into a bunch of other topics that I'm really excited to answer.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.960]   I really appreciate you all sending in these kind of random off-topic questions.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.440]   They're so fun to answer, so please keep them coming.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.960]   In the future, I don't know if I'll do travel Q&A, money Q&A, or I'll just
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.280]   kind of throw all the questions in there.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.720]   So whether you have a question in any of those topics, send them my way.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.120]   Chris@allthathacks.com.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.040]   I love doing these episodes and hopefully you enjoy them too.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.560]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.280]   I get it.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.560]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.880]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.960]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.320]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.400]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.440]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.280]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.680]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.200]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.840]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.880]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.760]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.680]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.920]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.280]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.120]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.920]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.880]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.240]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:06.400]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.240]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.280]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.560]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.600]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.440]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.000]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.840]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.400]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.560]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.280]   investments.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.600]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.760]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.960]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.720]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.520]   opportunities.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.760]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community because
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.160]   you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to you on
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.360]   everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's education, to finding
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.560]   a concierge doctor.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.480]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.160]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their minimum
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.640]   for membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle and it's totally free to
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.080]   join.

[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   So first one from David is what are my favorite podcasts and why?
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.080]   So this is a hard one because I listen to a lot of podcasts, but not all of that
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:01.840]   podcast, right?
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.480]   I find an episode that I'm excited about.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.840]   I listen to it, but it doesn't mean I necessarily subscribe.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.240]   So I'll start with the podcast I listen to pretty much every episode of.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.760]   That's All In, Animal Spirits, and My First Million.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.640]   All In is a show, I don't even know how to explain it.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.760]   But basically four kind of tech industry vets, and I think mostly billionaires,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.640]   just kind of get together every week and talk about the state of the world.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:32.280]   But the thing I love is that the four guys that host it have no concern saying
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.920]   things that are not mainstream opinions, not what the media is saying.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.600]   They're saying it how they feel it is.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.400]   And they have a perspective from the access they have to people around the
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.800]   world and information that they get that I don't that I just think is totally
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.480]   fascinating.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.280]   So it ends up being kind of maybe one third about tech, which is the industry
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.600]   I'm in, but it's not just like nuanced details about the industry.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.520]   Sometimes it's broader things about the trends that are happening in those
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.640]   companies, the types of benefits they're offering, the hiring plans, the layoffs,
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.760]   things like VR and whether that's actually a thing and where it's going.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:11.960]   But it's also a lot about markets and the economy and what's going on.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:17.800]   About things that I won't say politics, but there is a tone of politics, but
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.440]   presenting both sides.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.480]   And I don't know.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.960]   I just think it's a really good podcast that exposes me to perspectives that I
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.720]   don't find I get in other places.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.360]   I also listen to the Wednesday episodes of Animal Spirits every week.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.760]   I think Michael and Ben do a really great job of two things.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.000]   The primary thing being kind of commentary on the current market.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.920]   You know, what's going on, what's happening, why it's happening, their
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.880]   perspective being in this every day.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.000]   But then they also at the end give recommendations on TV shows and movies.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.800]   And I just, I think we, our tastes overlap.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.040]   I've had Ben from the show on all the hacks.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.760]   He's a friend of mine, but I think it's a really great show.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.680]   And I was listening before we even got connected.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.880]   Finally, I really enjoy listening to My First Million.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.640]   I just think it's kind of inspiration for the entrepreneurial side of my brain.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.200]   And I'm constantly hearing about new business ideas I hadn't thought about.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.800]   And it just, even if I'm not going to build those specific businesses, it
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.880]   pushes me to think in different ways.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.440]   And the banter between Sean and Sam is great.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.400]   So highly recommend that as well.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.760]   Then a lot of the other shows I like are either kind of current world
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.080]   situation dependent or kind of mood dependent.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.040]   If I need a laugh, I love listening to SmartLists.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.440]   I think it's one of the funniest podcasts out there.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.720]   I don't really even care who the guests are.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:42.120]   The banter and the, you know, heckling between each other is just next level.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.040]   So love that podcast.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.440]   If I feel like I really want to get into what's going on in the world on topics,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.320]   I love PBS NewsHour, you know, I know it's a show and it, but it's also
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.840]   available in podcast form and I love the daily, but I wouldn't say I listen
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.520]   to each one every single time.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.040]   It's just when there's a topic going on in the world, like, you know, the
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.320]   beginning of some major global event, I like to get brushed up there, especially
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.960]   when it comes to elections and politics.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:13.400]   I think PBS NewsHour does a better job than most outlets of trying to be impartial.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.040]   I know it's very hard for almost anyone to do these days.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.760]   I think they do a better job than many.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.520]   When I'm trying to really dive into the markets, investing, what's happening,
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.280]   trends like what's happening when, you know, oil futures were basically going
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.760]   crazy, I love the podcast Macro Voices.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.960]   It is a very deep nerdy dive into the investment world, but I love it.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.000]   When I just want an interview to go really deep on a person, I love the
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   interviews, Rich Roll does and Tim Ferriss does, and then there's a really
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.640]   fascinating show I'll recommend called How to Take Over the World that a guy
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:49.880]   named Ben Wilson, who's recently become a friend, runs where she basically
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.440]   synthesizes all the information out there about historical figures, great
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.680]   leaders and thinkers, and he tells their story in a way that I think is so
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.360]   fascinating.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.000]   So definitely recommend checking that show out.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.320]   The Thomas Edison episode was really, really great.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   When I'm trying to think about money and I just want to kind of learn a little
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.000]   bit about how people are thinking, Ramit Sethi, another guest of the show, does
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   a podcast called I Will Teach You to Be Rich, which is just something that, you
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.480]   know, I think about podcast formats sometimes and how so many are similar.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.360]   And his show is very different.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:28.600]   He does an anonymous conversation with couples about money that really just
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.880]   shines a light in an area that is very rarely seen in public.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.720]   So if you're really trying to think about money issues with your spouse or just
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.280]   want to understand how people think about money, I'd definitely check that out.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.880]   And then as a new creator, I've really, really started enjoying the Colin and
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.760]   Samir show.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.960]   You can watch it on YouTube or as a podcast, but they just have these really
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.440]   incredible interviews with other creators.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.360]   They just did two, one with Mr.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.080]   Beast, one with Hasan Minhaj, and they were just so fascinating.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.200]   Look, if you're not a creator, it might not be fascinating, but David, you asked
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.440]   what my favorite podcasts are, so I'm throwing it out there.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.600]   There are probably another dozen or two dozen podcasts that I've listened to a
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.160]   handful of episodes on and I follow, but I'm actually a pretty big podcast
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.800]   searcher, so if I'm looking for a topic or I'm looking to listen to an interview
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.000]   of someone, I'll just search Spotify, which I think has the best search of all
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.600]   podcast apps, and I'll find an episode and listen to it.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.560]   And if I enjoy it, you know, I might check out some other episodes from that
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.400]   podcaster, but not necessarily feel like I have to listen to every episode.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.280]   So I do have my podcasts that I love and I listen to every episode of, and
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.520]   then some that just come and go.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.240]   But a follow-up, though completely unrelated from Gavin, was if I knew any
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.880]   software or tips to help bookmark and save information via podcasts.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.400]   So he pointed out that he ends up stopping this show and taking notes on his phone,
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.600]   but didn't know if there was a way to make this more seamless.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.480]   So I'll link to one article that I found that I thought was kind of interesting
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.200]   in the show notes about how to do this.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.440]   But I would say there's not a perfect answer here.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:02.400]   I remember back in college, Microsoft Word for Mac had this amazing feature
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.840]   where you could hit record on your computer and take notes, and every time
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.920]   you typed a word, it would link that word to the timestamp in the audio.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.680]   I would love it if one of the podcast apps out there would let me take notes
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.000]   as I'm listening and link those notes to the timestamp so that I could go back
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.480]   and find that part of the episode.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.240]   If that exists and I couldn't find it in the research for this
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.720]   question, please let me know.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.000]   Some of the things that I've tried that I think are helpful.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.840]   One, if I'm listening to a show and I want to take notes, I'll carry a notebook.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.560]   I find that if I write things down in pen and paper, it helps me remember it.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.920]   And I can quickly just jot down the timestamp.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.920]   If I'm listening in Spotify, I can share the episode and you can
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.040]   actually share it with the timestamp.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.600]   So I can share that or save that in a note on Apple Notes and come back to it.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.760]   Or if you're in Overcast, you can share it.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.560]   You can create a clip depending on whether you really want to clip
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.480]   something, or you just want to remember this timestamp or an even simpler
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.720]   solution, you can just take a screenshot with a timestamp using this new feature
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.520]   on iOS 16, which I love, which is copy and delete.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.320]   So you take a screenshot, you can go in, you can close out, you can delete it.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   So it doesn't save your camera roll, but copy it before, and then just go
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.240]   paste it in notes and add something or email it to yourself.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.760]   So I don't think this is perfectly solved.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.720]   That's why I try my best to go in and create show notes.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.760]   That'll make it easy for you to go back and find the different segments of the
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.800]   podcast, find the links of the things we're talking about, I've thought about
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.320]   transcripts, you know, it costs money to get someone to go and make that transcript.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.960]   If that's something that you guys would get a lot of value out of, let me know.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.920]   And I'll consider getting someone to help create transcripts for the episode
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.320]   and put those up on the website as well.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:42.880]   Okay.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.480]   A few more.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.480]   Ruth has said she'd heard me talking about the Peloton on a podcast and
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.080]   wanted to know if I still liked it.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.000]   She's considering whether she does kind of the DIY version or the Peloton or
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.480]   an NYX fitness bike, and she's not sure which path to go.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.920]   I wrote an article many years ago, I called a $2,000 discount on a Peloton
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.800]   where I shared how I built a DIY Peloton.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.880]   It's still up at chrishutchens.com.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:13.560]   And, you know, for a year or two, we had the Peloton experience, or at
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.880]   least what I at the time thought was the Peloton experience for a much
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.120]   less expensive price, we bought a few hundred dollar bike, we attached
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.920]   some sensors that connected over Bluetooth to an iPad, and we paid the
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.680]   monthly fee to use the Peloton classes.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.200]   And I could get some of the data on cadence and speed, but not everything.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.600]   And I felt really great.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.680]   And then a friend of mine was moving and didn't want to move his Peloton
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.000]   and I bought it from him.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.960]   And I realized that the DIY version just didn't come close to the experience.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.400]   And at least for me, there's one really big component of the Peloton
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.000]   product that keeps me coming back.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.280]   And that is that you can race against yourself and others.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.480]   So for my personality, and this is why I don't really like SoulCycle, I am
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:02.840]   so motivated by trying to beat some record that I've set or a friend's
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:08.400]   set that I push myself harder every subsequent ride on the Peloton because
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.080]   I want to do better than I did last time.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:15.600]   So for me, the DIY solution didn't provide that and ultimately meant it
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.400]   was like, it didn't have the thing that pushed me to work harder.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.560]   So I would never go back to the DIY solution, but if you're on a tight
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.800]   budget or that feature doesn't matter to you, or if you can motivate yourself
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.440]   in a way that I can't, then that's great.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.000]   You don't need it.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.360]   But for me, I love it.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.440]   And you know, I don't think I'd do it any other way.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:31.800]   Okay.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:36.240]   Angela wrote in saying, I need hacks for food, planning what to eat,
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.080]   buying food, coordinating meals.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.520]   You know, it's something that happens three times a day, every day.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.360]   And the overhead is just a lot.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.600]   And so she wanted to know my ideas.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.320]   So I would say, I haven't nailed this, but I have tried a few things
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.520]   that I think would be helpful to share.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:57.320]   My first recommendation every time here is meal prep, which is very, very
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.720]   different than hiring a chef, which can be super expensive, but hiring
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:06.200]   someone local who can prep meals and drop them off and you can reheat them.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.040]   If you can't find someone searching online, you can post an ad on
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.400]   Craigslist, which I've done.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.560]   I'll even link to the actual ad I posted, which resulted in me finding
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.120]   someone that for, I'd say about halfway between the cost of groceries and the
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:24.640]   cost of ordering carry out every night, you could get someone cooking to the
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:30.040]   dietary restrictions and you know, diet needs you have every night of the week,
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.520]   usually once or twice a week so that it's not dropping food off every single
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.800]   day and putting that food in the fridge and you have it on hand and you save so
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.880]   much time, my wife and I actually like to cook.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.880]   So we go back and forth.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.040]   We kind of go in phases of, okay, we're doing meal prep.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.480]   Okay.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.400]   We're going to take a break from meal prep when we're not doing meal
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.160]   prep and we're actually buying groceries ourselves, shopping
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.520]   ourselves, cooking ourselves.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.840]   I love the paprika app.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.800]   I know it's an expensive app.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.680]   I know you have to pay for it on each platform you use it on, but I think
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.800]   it's so good and it's worth it for us.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.080]   It has three main functions.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.920]   One, it is our database of recipes.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.040]   Anytime we find a recipe anywhere on the internet, we use their bookmark
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.680]   extension and we save the recipe and paprika that we have it.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.160]   Two, it is a meal planner.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.000]   So we throw those recipes and we say, we're going to make this one on Tuesday.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.080]   We're going to make this one on Wednesday.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.320]   We're going to make this one on Friday.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.040]   And we do all of that every week so that we can plan out what we're having.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.640]   And then third, it's a grocery list organizer.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.440]   So you can take all those recipes that you have planned for the week,
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.000]   add them all to a grocery list, uncheck the ones you already have in your
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.240]   pantry, and it does an okay job of trying to remember which things you've bought.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.040]   You might, you know, by, by default, unchecking or checking boxes, but I
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.240]   think you still have to review it all.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.560]   And we use this app every week and it's so, so, so good.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.960]   I'm sure there are other apps that do the same thing.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.200]   And so you don't have to spend the money on paprika.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.440]   I just think a friend of mine recommended it once.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.680]   Thank you, Phil Toronto.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.320]   And you know, it's just, I love it.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.960]   So a couple of things that make it really easy.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.320]   We found like 20 recipes.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.880]   We've rated them all five stars in the app, put them in a
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.960]   folder to make life easier.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.600]   We just, every week, those recipes make up three to four of the meals a week.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.720]   So yes, each week we'll try one recipe that's new, but we'll also just
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.920]   rotate through the 20 that we really like.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.040]   We know we're healthy.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.240]   We know how to cook.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:21.040]   We have almost all the kind of basic spice level ingredients for, and it just
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:24.600]   makes the overhead of cooking so much easier because we're not trying to come
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.800]   up with five new meals every single week.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.240]   We're like, here's our database.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.200]   We're going to pull from this.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.080]   That covers 80% of the meals and we'll add one new one.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.560]   Maybe we'll add none or maybe one week we'll be really inspired, but that's
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.760]   really helped us, you know, make that machine move faster.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.640]   And then I just bite the bullet and we pay for groceries to be delivered.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.600]   Either often on Amazon fresh, sometimes if we're looking for things that aren't
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.240]   there with Whole Foods delivery, and that makes it a lot faster to get groceries
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:57.480]   because I can go order those groceries at 1030 at night before I go to bed instead
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.040]   of needing to drive to the grocery store.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:03.440]   That said our two-year-old really loves riding in carts at grocery stores.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.160]   So if it's an activity for your kids, then, you know, now we've been doing some
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.520]   of our grocery shopping like that, but if not, if she's not in the mood to go to
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.000]   the grocery store, I'm not either.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   I'll order online.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.840]   The one thing that I think Amazon does better than every other grocery
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.960]   delivery service is I don't think they've ever not had something.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.720]   They keep track of what's in stock and what's in their inventory.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.320]   Cause they're not actually running a store.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.520]   And so you're not missing an ingredient.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.440]   Every time I've ordered from Instacart, I've had at least one thing missing
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.280]   Whole Foods, it's like 50, 50, whether something's missing, they at least do a
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.720]   good job on Whole Foods delivery, messaging you saying we're out of this.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.680]   Do you want something else?
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.360]   But you know, if you're making a recipe and there's a core ingredient that's left
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.880]   off, well, you can't make the recipe anymore.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:49.120]   So that's why I love Amazon fresh because they just seem to get it right every time.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.160]   Okay, a couple last ones.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.600]   Jason wrote in asking whether I'd ever used a virtual assistant.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.160]   Feels like he's so busy managing life and considering one after
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.480]   he read the four hour work week.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.600]   But the time getting it set up and answering questions may not be worth it.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.240]   So I kind of agree with you in that it feels like it hasn't been worth it.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.680]   I've tried it in the past.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.000]   I just couldn't make it work.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.840]   And then a few weeks ago, Nick Gray, who's been on this show, posted a tweet
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.240]   thread about how he uses not one, but two virtual assistants, outlined all
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.840]   kinds of tasks he gives them and how he does it, he wrote a blog post about it
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.560]   also, and I'm ready to give it a try again.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:31.960]   So I'll try to give an update if and when I do it and how it goes.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.160]   But until then, in the show notes, I'll link out to Nick's post, which I thought
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.080]   was incredible, and hopefully that helps you think about how you
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.400]   might use a virtual assistant.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.320]   He lists all these tasks that kind of inspired me to think about doing this.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.040]   Things like scheduling appointments, running through all of his emails and
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.240]   unsubscribing, creating a budget template and categorizing expenses, ordering
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.400]   lunch, little graphic design tasks, adding photos to a blog post.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.640]   So I'm excited to give this a try.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.240]   It's going to be necessary to help scale the podcast.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.600]   So stay tuned.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.280]   So this next one's not as much a question as some advice from Phil about getting
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.240]   cell phone insurance free from your credit card.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:13.200]   So he does it with the Amex Platinum and says it saved him so much money,
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.000]   especially over the cost of getting it from Apple or his carrier.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.720]   And it actually covered his entire annual fee by using it.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.440]   And so I did a little bit of research to try to make sure I'm brushed up on the
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.360]   latest cell phone insurance coverages.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.560]   And actually, thank you so much, Phil, for writing this because I'd been using
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.600]   the Ink Business Preferred because of its coverage up to a thousand dollars a
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.560]   claim, which has now been reduced to 600.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.080]   So it's time for me to make a change.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:38.880]   So thank you.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.080]   And here's, here's the scoop.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:45.640]   So basically, there are a handful of cards, Amex Platinum, Capital One Venture
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.040]   X, Chase Freedom Flex, Ink Business Preferred, and Bilt.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   There are others, but those are kind of the most common points cards that all
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:55.400]   offer some form of cell phone protection.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:56:01.800]   Meaning, as long as you pay your cell phone bill on the card and a phone on that
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.080]   plan gets damaged, breaks, they will cover you.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.680]   They all have a deductible.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.000]   Bilt's is 25, Platinum Venture X and Freedom Flex are 50, and
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.400]   the Ink Business Preferred is a hundred.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.720]   They all have a cap on the claim.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.680]   All of them are $800 cap on the claim, except the Ink Business Preferred is now
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.960]   600, and then they all have a limit on how often you can use them.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.680]   For some, it's two times a year.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.920]   Some it's three times a year.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.160]   Some it's, you know, a thousand dollars a year.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.880]   And, and they'll cover your phone if something happens.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:34.280]   Now, if your damage happens in the first 90 days, I'd highly encourage you to use
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:37.960]   the purchase protection you have to cover your phone because it usually
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.720]   has a higher cap and no deductible.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.920]   But if something happens after 90 days and you pay your cell phone on your card,
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.440]   this is a great option if you break your phone, crack your screen or anything.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:52.520]   However, recently I noticed that carriers, at least Verizon in my case,
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:58.240]   offers a $10 a month per line discount to pay with a debit card or the Verizon
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.240]   credit card, which from my quick looking doesn't make sense to get, which means
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.480]   that I'm effectively paying Verizon $50 a month to be able to get this insurance
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.000]   policy.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.120]   So I did some quick math and I was like, okay, I'm paying $50 a month.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.200]   And, and technically two of those lines are my sister's not mine
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.320]   because we have a family plan.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.160]   So I'm paying $30 a month to be able to have insurance on three phones.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:24.720]   And if any of those, something happens to any of those phones, obviously
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.760]   I can cover it with a deductible with, you know, in this case with my credit
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:34.520]   card, but is it actually worth it to just pay on my debit card, make the $30 a
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:34.880]   month.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:41.120]   So I did the math and I said, okay, $30 a month times 12 months, I'm making $360 a
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:41.560]   year.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.200]   It kind of means that if you get a cracked screen once a year, it's a wash.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.240]   If you break your phone or you damage it beyond a screen, it's a better deal.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:53.160]   And if you never crack your screen, then it's, it's actually probably better for
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:58.320]   you to just make the $10 per month per line and pay out of pocket for your phone.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.560]   So I think it's a personal decision for you.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.440]   And if your carrier doesn't charge you to pay with a credit card, then it's a
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:03.960]   no brainer.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.080]   Definitely put it on a card that gives you cell phone insurance.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.920]   But for me now, I'm actually wondering if it makes sense because I don't break my
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.680]   phone that often.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.160]   And you know, if it's within the first 90 days, you can use your purchase
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:15.680]   protection.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.440]   So I'm actually thinking it might make more sense to switch to paying my cell
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:25.280]   phone plan with a debit card and just keep the $10 a month per line and know
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.160]   that I'm going to have to pay out of pocket if something happens, but thank
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.560]   you Phil for bringing this up, not only because it helped me realize I'm using
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.360]   the wrong card and gave me a reason to kind of think about what the decision
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.840]   I'm making, but because I think a lot of you out there are probably in a
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.800]   situation where you might have a card that includes cell phone coverage and
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.880]   you might not be using it to pay your cell phone bill.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.120]   So hopefully this can help out.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.920]   Finally, very fitting last question came in on Instagram.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.480]   How do I not get overwhelmed trying to optimize everything?
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.840]   So I don't have a great answer here and it's something I want to think about
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.480]   and maybe cover again in the future as I've put more time into it.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.960]   For me, I really enjoy this, so it doesn't feel overwhelming to go deep
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:07.440]   on a topic that I'm interested in, but it does take a lot of time
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.160]   and that time comes at an expense.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:13.720]   So one of the things I've been working on is just trying to find stopping
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:17.680]   points where I'm just, this is optimized enough, so it's, we've narrowed
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.760]   it down to three great hotels, stop, pick one, move on, you know, I'm
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.720]   trying to figure out how to get a good deal, but I'm at the point that I'm
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.880]   not likely to save any more than extra $5, stop, move on, so I've come up
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.040]   with thresholds where it's, if, if the purchase is under a hundred dollars,
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.840]   I might spend a few minutes finding a coupon code, good.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.520]   I'm not going to go crazy, but if it's a thousand dollars, I'm going to
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.200]   spend a lot more time to try to find a coupon, see if I buy one
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.480]   on Craigslist and all that.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.720]   So I just come up with these stopping points that, you know, I'm, I'm at the
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:48.480]   right point and then I have someone, which is my wife in almost all cases
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.440]   where I'm like, Hey, should we keep going?
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.920]   And it's so much easier for her to be like, no, stop.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.200]   And by the way, the same thing works in reverse.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   There was a point where I remember when we were trying to introduce
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.600]   our first daughter to solid foods, my wife was doing all of this research,
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.440]   trying to find and create meal plans.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.160]   And she was like, gosh, I feel like this is overwhelming.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.480]   I was like, was there any other way?
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.920]   She's like, well, there's this service.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.640]   They come with a meal plan.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.000]   I think it's called solid starts and it was fantastic.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.320]   Full endorsement here.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.120]   And she was like, well, they have a meal plan, but you have to pay for it.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.920]   I can't remember how much it was, but it was under a hundred dollars.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.280]   And I was like, you've spent hours.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.560]   You could keep spending hours.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.480]   I think it's just worth it.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.520]   And it's funny how if I were in the same situation, she was, it would
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.720]   have been so easy for her to tell me to stop, pay the a hundred dollars and be done.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.680]   And, but in the moment, it's so much harder.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.520]   So if I'm ever feeling like I'm going too far, I just check in with her and
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.240]   she often puts me on the right path and I do the same thing.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.360]   So that's one tip I have, but I will spend a little bit more time
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.560]   thinking about this because I think it's an important question.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:53.080]   But if you enjoy it, you know, maybe it's not as overwhelming as it would be
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.680]   if it was something you found stressful.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.480]   So if that's your case, I would say pick the areas in life where
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.960]   it's more enjoyable and focus your optimization energy there.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.640]   Okay.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.960]   That is it for this mailbag question.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.240]   Thank you so much to everyone who sent questions in.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.000]   I got a bunch of other questions that are related to travel points, miles, money
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.400]   that I didn't tackle today, and I'm going to tackle soon, you know, I've
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.800]   actually even been thinking about a format that my first million uses where
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.360]   they take one question every Friday and they tackle that as like a bonus episode.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.080]   So a lot of ideas on what I can be doing here.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:29.000]   I'm excited to keep helping answer questions, sharing more information.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.480]   Thank you so much for listening and sending things in.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.520]   If you have questions, please send them in.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520]   I love doing this.
