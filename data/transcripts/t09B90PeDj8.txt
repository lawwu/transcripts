[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.640]   with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.000]   Thank you to everyone who sends in questions.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.320]   We appreciate those emails.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.220]   So we get to three of them a week,
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.880]   so we can't get to all of them.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.440]   I wish we could.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.960]   But the next email that we are able to address
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.880]   comes to us from a listener named Mary.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.800]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.600]   This question is a follow-up to episode number 365.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.520]   Will you marry a couple already living together?
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.800]   How would you respond to a group
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.600]   of professing Christian leaders who teach or who imply
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.840]   that it's okay for couples to move in together
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.920]   and to engage in sex
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.200]   as long as the wedding date is set in stone?
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.400]   - I would respond by recording an Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.300]   to say how tragically wrong they are.
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.120]   That's how I would respond.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.520]   It's not okay for couples to have sex
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.960]   outside the marriage covenant, engaged or not engaged,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.780]   marriage date set or not.
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.780]   It's not okay to pretend that setting a marriage date
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.280]   is the same in God's eyes as making the marriage vows
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.920]   in the presence of God's people
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.220]   with the symbolic cultural sanctions of rings and vows
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.980]   and pronouncements and licenses.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.960]   It's mere fleshly pragmatism
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.640]   to treat an intention to get married
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.840]   as the same as being married.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.960]   Let me say that again.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   It is mere fleshly worldly pragmatism
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.420]   to treat an intention to get married
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.560]   the same as being married.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.440]   They're not the same.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.660]   Sexual relations are a sacred,
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.660]   physical, mental, spiritual consummation
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.500]   of awesomely sacred vows made before God
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.700]   in a moment when God himself really does join
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.260]   two people together in a one flesh union
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.980]   that he does not perform at random moments
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.260]   during engagement.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.700]   I mean, people need to come to terms
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.940]   with what God has joined together.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.200]   When does that happen?
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.260]   What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.660]   It happens in the formation of a decisive covenant vow
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.900]   which is permanent for better or for worse
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.300]   till death do us part.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.220]   Those are not empty, meaningless words
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.160]   tacked on to sleeping together for six months.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.940]   Let me give some biblical reasons for saying this.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.380]   In Matthew 1, Mary and Joseph are betrothed.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.140]   When Mary is found to be with child,
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.500]   Joseph has no doubt about what has happened.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.740]   She's been with another man
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.100]   and he's gonna break off with her.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.860]   And you see what it implies.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.740]   It never entered his mind that the child might be his.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.520]   They weren't sleeping together.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.020]   You don't sleep together when you're betrothed
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.060]   and you're living in God's way
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.300]   from the Old Testament and the New.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.460]   They were chased.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.600]   They were not having sex.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.980]   This was part of what it meant that Joseph was a just man.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.980]   You're not a just man, young man.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.860]   You're not a just man.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.020]   If you cave into the worldly pragmatism
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.020]   of just saving money on rent and jumping in bed together,
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.980]   that's not a just man.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.940]   That's a weak man with little biblical principle.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.860]   This was the expectation of the Jewish community
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.460]   rooted in God's Word in the Old Testament
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.500]   where sexual relations was bound to marriage
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.900]   as the seventh commandment makes clear.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.020]   So that's the first thing is Joseph and Mary's example.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.700]   Here's the second observation.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.740]   1 Corinthians 7 is crucial.
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.980]   In verse 2 is pivotal along with verse 36.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.980]   Paul said, "Because of the temptation to sexual immorality,"
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.420]   or you could translate it fornication,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.840]   "each man should have his own wife,"
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.640]   not betrothed partner,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.700]   "and each woman her own husband."
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.300]   In other words, Paul's remedy for sexual desire
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.780]   of a couple is not betrothal,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.960]   sleeping together for months before marriage.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.900]   His remedy is marriage.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.300]   It's even clearer in verse 36.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.300]   "If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.660]   toward his betrothed," literally his virgin,
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.840]   "if his passions are strong and it has to be,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.460]   let him do as he wishes, let them marry.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.820]   It is no sin."
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.780]   Now, this is remarkably relevant to our day.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.620]   Paul is dealing here with couples
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.740]   who are trying to be sexually proper
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.620]   and chaste without marriage.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.160]   And then he recognizes that in some cases,
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.700]   this sexual desire makes that highly unlikely.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.080]   And he concedes and says, "Go ahead, marry.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.700]   Don't compromise this.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.220]   Don't sleep together.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.460]   Marry."
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.740]   It is not sin to marry.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.460]   The assumption behind the whole chapter
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.380]   is that sexual relations during betrothal is sin.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.020]   That's the assumption of the chapter.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.100]   Marriage is not engagement.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.920]   The sacred entrance into the one flesh union
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.180]   that God has established is marriage.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.100]   Sexual relations is the consummation
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.020]   of that marriage commitment.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.220]   That's what God designed it to be.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   Sex is not a relief valve for desire
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.140]   or a mere pleasure with a devoted lover.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.660]   Sex is, and I'm gonna say this as strongly as I know how,
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.920]   sex is, this is the meaning, this is the definition,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.240]   this is the reality of human sexual relations.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.400]   Sex is, by God's design,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   sex is the consummation of the sacred covenant
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.640]   of God in marriage.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   All other sex is a prostitution of God's creation.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.680]   God joins a couple and he joins them in marriage.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.040]   Part of that joining is the sacred vow
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.680]   of establishing the covenant relationship,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.560]   and part of it is the subsequent consummation
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.000]   in sexual union.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.480]   The Bible does not recognize a legitimate use
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.760]   of sexual relations except as an expression
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.640]   of the covenant of marriage,
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.160]   no matter how crazy our modern world has become,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   and almost all media and entertainment have shown.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.600]   And I would just add very briefly
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.040]   that marriage is a public reality.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.040]   That is, a married man is to be known as a married man
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.240]   and a married woman is to be known as a married woman.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.120]   This is true because marriage changes forever
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.760]   how the man relates to other women
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.840]   and how the woman relates to other men,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.600]   and therefore it needs to be known.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.360]   And it's true because in every culture
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.680]   there are unavoidable legal implications of marriage.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.240]   For example, parental rights, property rights,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.320]   inheritances, and therefore the act
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.880]   of entering a marital state is a public act.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.240]   That is, it needs legal and public recognition.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.520]   Different cultures handle it in different ways.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.720]   I'm not quibbling about how different cultures do it.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.560]   And a humble Christian couple,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.400]   this is relevant for our culture,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   a humble Christian couple who wants to be biblical
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.520]   should be eager to use the cultural
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.360]   and legally appointed ways of solemnizing
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.640]   and legalizing their covenant union.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.960]   The essence of this event is the promise,
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.920]   the vows before God to be a faithful wife
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.120]   and a faithful husband till death do us part.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.040]   And in view of all of this,
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   the last thing a Christian couple will want to do
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   is isolate sex from its beautiful covenant place
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:17.720]   and meaning at the heart of the marriage covenant.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.040]   They won't want to do it.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.520]   They won't want to strip it out and isolate it.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   They will treat every act of sexual self-control
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.160]   before marriage,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.440]   every act of sexual self-control during their engagement
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   as an exaltation of the preciousness and the beauty
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.320]   and the meaning of this act
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.080]   as the consummation of covenant commitment in marriage.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.040]   They will be jealous to set a beautiful example
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.280]   to their peers and to the children
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.560]   that are watching and the teenagers around them
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.800]   that are all watching them,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.520]   knowing what they do,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   that sexual relations belongs in marriage.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.480]   They will want to witness with their lives
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.400]   that God created this beautiful gift
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.320]   and placed it precisely where he knew it should be,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.120]   the most satisfying, most fruitful, most beautiful,
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.440]   most God-honoring place in marriage.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.160]   Therefore, Christians do not sleep together
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.400]   before their wedding night.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.640]   - Amen, thank you for this call for discretion, Pastor John,
