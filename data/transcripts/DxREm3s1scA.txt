[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   "The following is a conversation with Elon Musk,
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.080]   "his third time on this The Lex Friedman Podcast."
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.520]   Yeah, make yourself comfortable.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.360]   - Boo.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.200]   - Oh, wow, okay.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.120]   (laughing)
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.880]   - Do you don't do the headphones thing?
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.700]   - No.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.540]   - Okay.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.920]   I mean, how close do I need to get at the same thing?
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.680]   - The closer you are, the sexier you sound.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.520]   - Hey, babe.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.340]   - Yep.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.000]   - Can't get enough of the oil, baby.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.960]   (laughing)
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.760]   - I'm gonna clip that out
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760]   anytime somebody messages me about it.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.960]   - You want my body and you think I'm sexy.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   ♪ Come right out and tell me so ♪
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.120]   (humming)
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.760]   - So good.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.920]   Okay, serious mode activate.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.760]   All right.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.400]   - Serious mode.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.760]   Come on, you're Russian, you can be serious.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.600]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.720]   - Everyone's serious all the time in Russia.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.560]   - Yeah.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.080]   (laughing)
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.920]   We'll get there, we'll get there.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.760]   - Yeah.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.600]   - It's gotten soft.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.760]   Allow me to say that the SpaceX launch
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.920]   of human beings to orbit on May 30th, 2020
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.880]   was seen by many as the first step
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.400]   in a new era of human space exploration.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.600]   These human spaceflight missions were a beacon of hope
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.720]   to me and to millions over the past two years
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.640]   as our world has been going through
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.040]   one of the most difficult periods in recent human history.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.720]   We saw, we see the rise of division, fear, cynicism,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.600]   and the loss of common humanity
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.360]   right when it is needed most.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.040]   So first, Elon, let me say thank you
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.600]   for giving the world hope and reason
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.480]   to be excited about the future.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.160]   - Oh, it's kind of easy to say.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.440]   I do want to do that.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.280]   Humanity has obviously a lot of issues
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.600]   and people at times do bad things,
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.200]   but despite all that, I love humanity
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   and I think we should make sure we do everything
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.600]   we can to have a good future and an exciting future
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320]   and one that maximizes the happiness of the people.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.960]   - Let me ask about Crew Dragon Demo 2,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.360]   so that first flight with humans on board.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.160]   How did you feel leading up to that launch?
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.240]   Were you scared?
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   Were you excited?
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.640]   What was going through your mind?
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.360]   So much was at stake.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.320]   - Yeah, no, that was extremely stressful, no question.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.720]   We obviously could not let them down in any way.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.720]   So extremely stressful, I'd say, to say the least.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.920]   I was confident that at the time that we launched
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   that no one could think of anything at all to do
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.080]   that would improve the probability of success.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.360]   And we racked our brains to think of any possible way
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.840]   to improve the probability of success.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.080]   We could not think of anything more and nor could NASA.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.480]   And so that's just the best that we could do.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.720]   So then we went ahead and launched.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.840]   Now I'm not a religious person,
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.640]   but I nonetheless got on my knees and prayed
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.480]   for that mission.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.840]   - Were you able to sleep?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.680]   - No.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   - How did it feel when it was a success?
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.760]   First when the launch was a success
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.600]   and when they returned back home or back to Earth?
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.160]   - It was a great relief.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.480]   For high-stress situations,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.040]   I find it's not so much elation as relief.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.480]   And I think once, as we got more comfortable
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.500]   and proved out the systems, 'cause we really,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.280]   you gotta make sure everything works.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.200]   It was definitely a lot more enjoyable
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.520]   with the subsequent astronaut missions.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.840]   And I thought the Inspiration mission
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.960]   was actually very inspiring, the Inspiration 4 mission.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.080]   I'd encourage people to watch
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.560]   the Inspiration documentary on Netflix.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.860]   It's actually really good.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.360]   And it really is, I was actually inspired by that.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.760]   And so that one, I felt I was kind of able
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.320]   to enjoy the actual mission
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.880]   and not just be super stressed all the time.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.760]   - So for people that somehow don't know,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.240]   it's the all-civilian, first time all-civilian
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.400]   out to space, out to orbit.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.480]   - Yeah, and it was, I think, the highest orbit
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.120]   that in like, I don't know, 30 or 40 years or something.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.520]   The only one that was higher was the one shuttle,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.160]   sorry, a Hubble servicing mission.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.980]   And then before that, it would have been Apollo in '72.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.180]   It's pretty wild.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.480]   So it's cool.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   I think as a species, we want to be continuing
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.720]   to do better and reach higher ground.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.880]   And I think it would be tragic, extremely tragic,
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.040]   if Apollo was the high-water mark for humanity,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.800]   and that's as far as we ever got.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.040]   And it's concerning that here we are,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   49 years after the last mission to the moon,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.040]   and so almost half a century, and we've not been back.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.280]   And that's worrying.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.360]   It's like, does that mean we've peaked
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.960]   as a civilization or what?
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.480]   So I think we've got to get back to the moon
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.160]   and build a base there, a science base.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.880]   I think we could learn a lot about the nature
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.120]   of the universe if we have a proper science base
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.940]   on the moon.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.520]   Like we have a science base in Antarctica
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.080]   and many other parts of the world.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.880]   And so that's, I think, the next big thing.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.680]   We've got to have a serious moon base
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.000]   and then get people to Mars and get out there
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.600]   and be a space-faring civilization.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.480]   - I'll ask you about some of those details,
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.520]   but since you're so busy with the hard engineering
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.440]   challenges of everything that's involved,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.000]   are you still able to marvel at the magic of it all,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.880]   of space travel, of every time the rocket goes up,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.140]   especially when it's a crude mission?
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.440]   Or are you just so overwhelmed with all the challenges
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.600]   that you have to solve?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.240]   - And actually, sort of to add to that,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.200]   the reason I wanted to ask this question of May 30th,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.800]   it's been some time, so you can look back
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.480]   and think about the impact already.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.320]   It's already, at the time, it was an engineering problem,
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.280]   maybe, now it's becoming a historic moment.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.600]   Like it's a moment that, how many moments
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.680]   will be remembered about the 21st century?
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.440]   To me, that or something like that, maybe Inspiration 4,
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.720]   one of those will be remembered as the early steps
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.300]   of a new age of space exploration.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.620]   - Yeah, I mean, during the launches itself,
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.100]   so I mean, the thing I think maybe some people know,
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.180]   but a lot of people don't know,
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.100]   is I'm actually the chief engineer of SpaceX,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.660]   so I've signed off on pretty much
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.000]   all the design decisions.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.100]   And so if there's something that goes wrong
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.980]   with that vehicle, it's fundamentally my fault.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.780]   So I'm really just thinking about all the things that,
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.580]   like so when I see the rocket,
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.300]   I see all the things that could go wrong
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.500]   and the things that could be better,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   and the same with the Dragon spacecraft.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.120]   It's like, other people see, oh, this is a spacecraft
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.020]   or a rocket, and this looks really cool.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.580]   I'm like, I have like a readout of like,
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.200]   this is the, these are the risks,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.820]   these are the problems, that's what I see.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.220]   Like, ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.300]   (laughing)
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.820]   So it's not what other people see
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.420]   when they see the product, you know?
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.020]   - So let me ask you then to analyze Starship
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.340]   in that same way.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.500]   I know you have, you'll talk about,
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.580]   in more detail about Starship in the near future, perhaps.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.820]   - Yeah, we can talk about it now if you want.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.140]   - But just in that same way, like you said,
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.620]   you see, when you see a rocket,
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.140]   you see a sort of a list of risks.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.060]   In that same way, you said that Starship
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.260]   is a really hard problem.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.460]   So there's many ways I can ask this,
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.640]   but if you magically could solve one problem
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.740]   perfectly, one engineering problem perfectly,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.020]   which one would it be?
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.140]   - On Starship?
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.540]   - On, sorry, on Starship.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.060]   So is it maybe related to the efficiency of the engine,
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.380]   the weight of the different components,
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.700]   the complexity of various things,
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.740]   maybe the controls of the crazy thing it has to do to land?
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.900]   - No, it's actually, by far,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.740]   the biggest thing absorbing my time is engine production.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.500]   Not the design of the engine,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.500]   but I've often said prototypes are easy,
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.840]   production is hard.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.680]   So we have the most advanced rocket engine
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.240]   that's ever been designed.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.240]   'Cause I say currently the best rocket engine ever
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.580]   is probably the RD-180 or RD-170,
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.600]   that's the Droid Russian engine, basically.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.780]   And still, I think an engine should only count
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.020]   if it's gotten something to orbit.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.920]   So our engine has not gotten anything to orbit yet,
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.980]   but it's the first engine that's actually better
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.980]   than the Russian RD engines, which were amazing design.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.140]   - So you're talking about Raptor engine,
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.500]   what makes it amazing?
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.260]   What are the different aspects of it that make it,
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.940]   like what are you the most excited about
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.080]   if the whole thing works in terms of efficiency,
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.120]   all those kinds of things?
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.120]   - Well, the Raptor is a full-flow staged combustion engine
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:50.840]   and it's operating at a very high chamber pressure.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.640]   So one of the key figures of merit,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   perhaps the key figure of merit is
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.680]   what is the chamber pressure
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.800]   at which the rocket engine can operate?
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.060]   That's the combustion chamber pressure.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.940]   So Raptor is designed to operate at 300 bar,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.320]   possibly maybe higher, that's 300 atmospheres.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   So the record right now for operational engine
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.860]   is the RD engine that I mentioned, the Russian RD,
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.280]   which is, I believe, around 267 bar.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.140]   And the difficulty of the chamber pressure
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.860]   increases on a nonlinear basis.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.860]   So 10% more chamber pressure is more like 50% more difficult.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:38.640]   But that chamber pressure is,
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.940]   that is what allows you to get a very high power density
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.240]   for the engine.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:51.140]   So enabling a very high thrust to weight ratio
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:57.020]   and a very high specific impulse.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.020]   So specific impulse is like a measure
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.660]   of the efficiency of a rocket engine.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.660]   It's really the effective exhaust velocity
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.120]   of the gas coming out of the engine.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:17.140]   So with a very high chamber pressure,
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.580]   you can have a compact engine
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.980]   that nonetheless has a high expansion ratio,
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.980]   which is the ratio between the exit nozzle and the throat.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.860]   So you know, engines got,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.980]   like you see a rocket engine's got like,
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   sort of like a hourglass shape.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.140]   It's like a chamber and then it necks down
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.700]   and there's a nozzle.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.860]   And the ratio of the exit diameter
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.940]   to the throat is the expansion ratio.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.660]   - So why is it such a hard engine to manufacture at scale?
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.100]   - It's very complex.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.180]   - So what does complexity mean here?
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.740]   There's a lot of components involved.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.620]   - There's a lot of components
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.020]   and a lot of unique materials.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.020]   So we had to invent several alloys
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.560]   that don't exist in order to make this engine work.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.020]   - So it's a materials problem too.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.220]   - It's a materials problem.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.740]   And in a staged combustion,
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.820]   a full flow staged combustion,
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.180]   there are many feedback loops in the system.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:29.180]   So basically you've got propellants
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.060]   and hot gas flowing simultaneously
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.100]   to so many different places on the engine.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.780]   And they all have a recursive effect on each other.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.900]   So you change one thing here,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.100]   it has a recursive effect here,
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.500]   changes something over there.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.480]   And it's quite hard to control.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.060]   Like there's a reason no one's made this before.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:03.860]   And the reason we're doing a staged combustion full flow
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.700]   is because it has the highest
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.000]   theoretical possible efficiency.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.740]   So in order to make a fully reusable rocket,
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:23.200]   which that's the really the holy grail of orbital rocketry,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.420]   you have to have, everything's gotta be the best.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.080]   It's gotta be the best engine,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.100]   the best airframe, the best heat shield,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.920]   extremely light avionics,
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.620]   very clever control mechanisms.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.100]   You've got to shed mass in any possible way that you can.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.620]   For example, we are, instead of putting landing legs
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.660]   on the booster and ship,
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.740]   we are gonna catch them with a tower
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.220]   to save the weight of the landing legs.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.220]   So that's like, I mean, we're talking about catching
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.180]   the largest flying object ever made
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:06.660]   on a giant tower with chopstick arms.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.660]   It's like a karate kid with the fly, but much bigger.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.060]   (laughing)
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:12.900]   - I mean, pulling something like that--
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.480]   - This probably won't work the first time.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.820]   Anyway, so this is bananas, this is banana stuff.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.100]   - So you mentioned that you doubt, well, not you doubt,
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.460]   but there's days or moments when you doubt
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.340]   that this is even possible.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.140]   It's so difficult.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.120]   - The possible part is, well, at this point,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.460]   I think we'll get Starship to work.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.860]   There's a question of timing.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.460]   How long will it take us to do this?
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.700]   How long will it take us to actually achieve
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.060]   full and rapid reusability?
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.660]   'Cause it will take probably many launches
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.680]   before we're able to have full and rapid reusability.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.140]   But I can say that the physics pencils out.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.080]   At this point, I'd say we're confident that,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.020]   like let's say, I'm very confident success
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.980]   is in the set of all possible outcomes.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.340]   For a while there, I was not convinced
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.780]   that success was in the set of possible outcomes,
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.460]   which is very important, actually.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:29.700]   - You're saying there's a chance.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.660]   - I'm saying there's a chance, exactly.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.080]   I'm just not sure how long it will take.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.580]   We have a very talented team.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.980]   They're working night and day to make it happen.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:48.300]   And like I said, the critical thing to achieve
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.580]   for the revolution in space flight and for humanity
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.020]   to be a space-faring civilization
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.380]   is to have a fully and rapidly reusable rocket,
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.220]   orbital rocket.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.820]   There's not even been any orbital rocket
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.100]   that's been fully reusable ever,
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:05.040]   and this has always been the holy grail of rocketry.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.700]   And many smart people, very smart people,
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.500]   have tried to do this before and they've not succeeded,
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.100]   'cause it's such a hard problem.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:21.220]   - What's your source of belief in situations like this,
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.580]   when the engineering problem is so difficult?
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.500]   There's a lot of experts, many of whom you admire,
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.220]   who have failed in the past.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.060]   - Yes.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.060]   - And a lot of people,
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.900]   a lot of experts, maybe journalists, all the kind of,
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.900]   the public in general have a lot of doubt
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.820]   about whether it's possible.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.340]   And you yourself know that even if it's a non-null set,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.540]   non-empty set of success,
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.140]   it's still unlikely or very difficult.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.740]   Like, where do you go to, both personally,
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.940]   intellectually as an engineer, as a team,
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.820]   like for source of strength needed
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.540]   to sort of persevere through this?
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.440]   And to keep going with the project, take it to completion?
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:19.820]   - A source of strength, hmm.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.320]   It doesn't really matter how I think about things.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.540]   I mean, for me, it's simply this is something
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.040]   that is important to get done.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.500]   And we should just keep doing it or die trying.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.980]   And I don't need a source of strength.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.180]   - So quitting is not even like--
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.900]   - That's not in my nature.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.720]   - Okay.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.120]   - And I don't care about optimism or pessimism.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.900]   Fuck that, we're gonna get it done.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.900]   - Gonna get it done.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:55.180]   Can you then zoom back in to specific problems
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.340]   with Starship or any engineering problems you work on?
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.060]   Can you try to introspect
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.260]   your particular biological neural network,
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.380]   your thinking process, and describe how you think
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.180]   through problems, the different engineering
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.020]   and design problems?
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.100]   Is there like a systematic process?
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.900]   You've spoken about first principles thinking,
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.180]   but is there a kind of process to it?
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.180]   - Well, yeah, I like saying like physics is law
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.700]   and everything else is a recommendation.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.220]   Like I've met a lot of people that can break the law,
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.620]   but I haven't met anyone who could break physics.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:31.740]   So first, for any kind of technology problem,
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.540]   you have to sort of just make sure
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.860]   you're not violating physics.
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:44.820]   And first principles analysis,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.980]   I think is something that can be applied
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.840]   to really any walk of life, anything really.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.680]   It's really just saying, let's boil something down
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.420]   to the most fundamental principles,
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.840]   the things that we are most confident are true
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.480]   at a foundational level.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.040]   And that sets your axiomatic base,
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.000]   and then you reason up from there,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.020]   and then you cross-check your conclusion
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.320]   against the axiomatic truths.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:18.120]   So some basics in physics would be like,
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.280]   oh, you're violating conservation of energy or momentum
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.700]   or something like that, then it's not gonna work.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:30.760]   So that's just to establish, is it possible?
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.720]   And another good physics tool is thinking about things
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.560]   in the limit.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.360]   If you take a particular thing
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.680]   and you scale it to a very large number
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.840]   or to a very small number, how do things change?
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.920]   - Both in number of things you manufacture
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.640]   or something like that, and then in time?
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.920]   - Yeah, let's say take an example of manufacturing,
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.140]   which I think is just a very underrated problem.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:04.520]   And like I said, it's much harder
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   to take an advanced technology product
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.000]   and bring it into volume manufacturing
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.360]   than it is to design it in the first place,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.500]   or as an attitude.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.800]   So let's say you're trying to figure out
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   is, like, why is this part or product expensive?
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.400]   Is it because of something fundamentally foolish
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.320]   that we're doing, or is it because our volume is too low?
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.200]   And so then you say, okay, well,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.240]   what if our volume was a million units a year?
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.760]   Is it still expensive?
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.140]   That's what I mean by thinking about things in the limit.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.140]   If it's still expensive at a million units a year,
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.520]   then volume is not the reason why your thing is expensive.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.700]   There's something fundamental about the design.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.460]   - And then you then can focus on reducing the complexity
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.300]   or something like that in the design?
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.780]   - You could change the design to,
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.260]   change the part to be something
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.580]   that is not fundamentally expensive.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.940]   But that's a common thing in rocketry,
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.820]   'cause the unit volume is relatively low,
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.100]   and so a common excuse would be,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.460]   well, it's expensive because our unit volume is low.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.740]   And if we were in automotive or something like that,
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.900]   or consumer electronics, then our costs would be lower.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.240]   I'm like, okay, so let's say,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.640]   now you're making a million units a year.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.040]   Is it still expensive?
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.640]   If the answer is yes,
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.080]   then economies of scale are not the issue.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.120]   - Do you throw into manufacturing,
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.040]   do you throw supply chain?
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.760]   You talked about resources and materials
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.600]   and stuff like that.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.920]   Do you throw that into the calculation
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.760]   of trying to reason from first principles,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.600]   like how we're gonna make the supply chain work here?
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.800]   - And then the cost of materials, things like that,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.920]   or is that too much?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.860]   - Exactly, so like a good example,
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.380]   like you're thinking about things in the limit,
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.860]   is if you take any product,
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:53.100]   any machine or whatever,
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.060]   like take a rocket or whatever,
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:01.060]   and say, if you look at the raw materials in the rocket,
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:06.780]   so you're gonna have like aluminum, steel,
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.780]   titanium, Inconel, specialty alloys, copper,
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:18.480]   and you say, what's the weight of the constituent elements
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.440]   of each of these elements,
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.600]   and what is their raw material value?
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.720]   And that sets the asymptotic limit
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.480]   for how low the cost of the vehicle can be
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.780]   unless you change the materials.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.960]   So, and then when you do that,
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.760]   I call it like maybe the magic wand number
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.600]   or something like that.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.740]   So that would be like, if you had the,
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.520]   like just a pile of these raw materials here,
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.620]   and you could wave the magic wand
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.880]   and rearrange the atoms into the final shape,
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.560]   that would be the lowest possible cost
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.920]   that you could make this thing for
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.680]   unless you change the materials.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.760]   So then, and that is always,
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.380]   almost always a very low number.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.160]   So then what's actually causing things to be expensive
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.020]   is how you put the atoms into the desired shape.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   - Yeah, actually, if you don't mind me taking a tiny tangent,
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.400]   I often talk to Jim Keller,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.440]   who's somebody that worked with you as a friend.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.760]   - Jim was, yeah, did great work at Tesla.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.480]   - So I suppose he carries the flame
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.560]   of the same kind of thinking that you're talking about now.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.600]   And I guess I see that same thing at Tesla
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.760]   and SpaceX folks who work there,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.760]   they kind of learn this way of thinking,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.720]   and it kind of becomes obvious almost.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.680]   But anyway, I had argument, not argument,
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.800]   he educated me about how cheap it might be
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.600]   to manufacture a Tesla bot.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.360]   We just, we had an argument.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.520]   How can you reduce the cost of the scale
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.120]   of producing a robot?
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.960]   Because I've gotten the chance to interact quite a bit,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.480]   obviously in the academic circles with humanoid robots,
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.920]   and then my boss in dynamics and stuff like that,
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.520]   and they're very expensive to build.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.600]   And then Jim kind of schooled me on saying like,
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.080]   okay, like this kind of first principles thinking
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.440]   of how can we get the cost of manufacture down?
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.840]   I suppose you do that, you have done that kind of thinking
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   for Tesla bot and for all kinds of complex systems
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   that are traditionally seen as complex.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.160]   And you say, okay, how can we simplify everything down?
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.520]   - Yeah.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.440]   I mean, I think if you are really good at manufacturing,
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.320]   you can basically make, at high volume,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.520]   you can basically make anything for a cost
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.040]   that asymptotically approaches the raw material value
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.600]   of the constituents, plus any intellectual property
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.520]   that you need to do license.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.360]   Anything.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.280]   But it's hard.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.840]   It's not like, that's a very hard thing to do,
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.720]   but it is possible for anything.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.480]   Anything in volume can be made, like I said,
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.440]   for a cost that asymptotically approaches
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.800]   this raw material constituents,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.400]   plus intellectual property license rights.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.520]   So what will often happen in trying to design a product
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.440]   is people will start with the tools and parts and methods
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.520]   that they are familiar with,
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.480]   and then try to create a product
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.560]   using their existing tools and methods.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:25.080]   The other way to think about it is actually imagine the,
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.800]   try to imagine the platonic ideal of the perfect product,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.360]   or technology, whatever it might be.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.680]   And so what is the perfect arrangement of atoms
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.560]   that would be the best possible product?
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.840]   And now let us try to figure out
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.600]   how to get the atoms in that shape.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.620]   - I mean, it sounds,
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.400]   it's almost like Rick and Morty absurd
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.080]   until you start to really think about it,
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.440]   and you really should think about it in this way,
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.180]   'cause everything else is kind of,
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:03.040]   if you think you might fall victim to the momentum
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.440]   of the way things were done in the past,
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.000]   unless you think in this way.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.680]   - Well, just as a function of inertia,
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.640]   people will want to use the same tools and methods
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.040]   that they are familiar with.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.720]   They just, that's what they'll do by default.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   And then that will lead to an outcome of things
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.480]   that can be made with those tools and methods,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.880]   but is unlikely to be the platonic ideal
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.040]   of the perfect product.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.480]   So then, so that's why,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.120]   it's good to think of things in both directions.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.200]   So like, what can we build with the tools that we have?
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.600]   But then, but also what is the perfect,
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.240]   the theoretical perfect product look like?
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.560]   And that theoretical perfect product
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.700]   is gonna be a moving target, 'cause as you learn more,
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.920]   the definition for that perfect product will change,
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.720]   'cause you don't actually know what the perfect product is,
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.080]   but you can successfully approximate a more perfect product.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.680]   So thinking about it like that, and then saying,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.920]   okay, now, what tools, methods, materials, whatever,
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.680]   do we need to create in order to get the atoms in that shape?
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:10.160]   But people rarely think about it that way.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.780]   But it's a powerful tool.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.800]   - I should mention that the brilliant Siobhan Zillis
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   is hanging out with us, in case you hear a voice of wisdom
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.120]   from outside, from up above.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.200]   Okay, so let me ask you about Mars.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.440]   You mentioned it would be great for science
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:35.000]   to put a base on the moon to do some research,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.800]   but the truly big leap, again,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.880]   in this category of seemingly impossible,
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.800]   is to put a human being on Mars.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.920]   When do you think SpaceX will land a human being on Mars?
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.200]   - Hmm.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:28:12.660]   Best case is about five years, worst case, 10 years.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.820]   (sighing)
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.580]   - What are the determining factors, would you say,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.180]   from an engineering perspective,
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.040]   or is that not the bottlenecks?
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.620]   - You know, it's fundamentally,
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.960]   you know, engineering the vehicle.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:36.580]   I mean, Starship is the most complex and advanced rocket
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.620]   that's ever been made by, I don't know,
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.820]   what, a magnitude or something like that.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.640]   It's a lot, it's really next level, so.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:49.260]   And the fundamental optimization of Starship
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.540]   is minimizing cost per ton to orbit,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.820]   and ultimately cost per ton to the surface of Mars.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.400]   This may seem like a mercantile objective,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.300]   but it is actually the thing that needs to be optimized.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:04.060]   Like, there is a certain cost per ton to the surface of Mars
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.940]   where we can afford to establish a self-sustaining city,
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.620]   and then above that, we cannot afford to do it.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.780]   So right now, you can fly to Mars for a trillion dollars,
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.140]   no amount of money could get you a ticket to Mars.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.460]   So we need to get that above, you know,
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.640]   to get that, like, something that is actually possible
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.480]   at all.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:32.100]   But then, but that's, we don't just wanna have,
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.840]   you know, with Mars, flags and footprints,
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.900]   and then not come back for a half century,
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.940]   like we did with the Moon.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.940]   In order to pass a very important great filter,
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.700]   I think we need to be a multi-planet species.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.460]   This may sound somewhat esoteric to a lot of people,
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.720]   but like, eventually, given enough time,
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.500]   there's something, the Earth is likely to experience
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:05.260]   some calamity that could be something
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.040]   that humans do to themselves or an external event,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.580]   like happened to the dinosaurs.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:16.140]   And, but eventually, and if none of that happens,
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.300]   and somehow, magically, we keep going,
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.540]   then the Sun is gradually expanding,
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.620]   and will engulf the Earth,
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.060]   and probably Earth gets too hot for life
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.780]   in about 500 million years.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.280]   It's a long time, but that's only 10% longer
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.340]   than Earth has been around.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.220]   And so if you think about, like, the current situation,
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.620]   it's really remarkable, and kind of hard to believe,
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.100]   but Earth's been around 4 1/2 billion years,
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.340]   and this is the first time in 4 1/2 billion years
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.700]   that it's been possible to extend life beyond Earth.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.820]   And that window of eternity may be open for a long time,
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.740]   and I hope it is, but it also may be open for a short time.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.660]   And we should, I think it is wise for us to
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.020]   act quickly while the window is open,
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.780]   just in case it closes.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.820]   - Yeah, the existence of nuclear weapons, pandemics,
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.820]   all kinds of threats should kind of give us some motivation.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.800]   - I mean, civilization could get,
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.500]   could die with a bang or a whimper, you know,
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.020]   if it dies a demographic collapse,
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.260]   then it's more of a whimper, obviously.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.700]   But if it's World War III, it's more of a bang.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.120]   But these are all risks.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.540]   I mean, it's important to think of these things
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.060]   and just, you know, think of things as probabilities,
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.620]   not certainties.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.460]   There's a certain probability that something bad
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.300]   will happen on Earth.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.540]   I think most likely the future will be good.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.420]   But there's, like, let's say for argument's sake,
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.580]   a 1% chance per century of a civilization ending event.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.680]   Like, that was Stephen Hawking's estimate.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.420]   I think he might be right about that.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:15.420]   So then, you know, we should basically think of this
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.500]   like being a multi-planet species,
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.460]   just like taking out insurance for life itself.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.200]   Like life insurance for life.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:29.300]   - Wow, it's turned into an infomercial real quick.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.540]   - Life insurance for life, yes.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.700]   And, you know, we can bring the creatures from,
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.980]   you know, plants and animals from Earth to Mars
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.580]   and breathe life into the planet
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.680]   and have a second planet with life.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.940]   That would be great.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.500]   They can't bring themselves there, you know,
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.980]   so if we don't bring them to Mars,
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.260]   then they will just for sure all die
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.180]   when the sun expands anyway, and then that'll be it.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.520]   - What do you think is the most difficult aspect
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.220]   of building a civilization on Mars, terraforming Mars,
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.720]   like from engineering perspective,
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.180]   from a financial perspective, human perspective,
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:12.180]   to get a large number of folks there
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.820]   who will never return back to Earth?
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.100]   - No, they could certainly return.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.420]   Some will return back to Earth.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.900]   - They will choose to stay there
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.260]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.140]   - Yeah, many will.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:28.420]   But, you know, we need the spaceships back.
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.980]   Like the ones that go to Mars, we need them back.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.620]   So you can hop on if you want, you know.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.940]   But we can't just not have the spaceships come back.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:35.780]   Those things are expensive.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:36.600]   We need them back.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.740]   I'd like to come back and do another trip.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.660]   - I mean, do you think about the terraforming aspect,
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.180]   like actually building, are you so focused right now
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.700]   on the spaceships part that's so critical to get to Mars?
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.220]   - We absolutely, if you can't get there,
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.620]   nothing else matters.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.220]   So, and like I said, we can't get there
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.660]   with some extraordinarily high cost.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.780]   I mean, the current cost of, let's say,
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.060]   one ton to the surface of Mars
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.660]   is on the order of a billion dollars.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.860]   So, 'cause you don't just need the rocket
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.660]   and the launch and everything, you need like heat shield,
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.860]   you need guidance system,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.260]   you need deep space communications,
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.020]   you need some kind of landing system.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.540]   So like rough approximation would be a billion dollars
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.180]   per ton to the surface of Mars right now.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.900]   This is obviously way too expensive
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.080]   to create a self-sustaining civilization.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:35.680]   So we need to improve that by at least a factor of 1,000.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.460]   - A million per ton?
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.880]   - Yes, ideally much less than a million a ton.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.260]   But if it's not, like it's gotta be,
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.620]   you ever say like, well, how much can society afford
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.420]   to spend or want to spend
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.380]   on a self-sustaining city on Mars?
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.780]   The self-sustaining part is important.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.240]   Like it's just the key threshold,
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.340]   the grateful to will have been passed
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.300]   when the city on Mars can survive
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.700]   even if the spaceships from Earth stop coming
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.980]   for any reason, doesn't matter what the reason is,
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.140]   but if they stop coming for any reason,
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.700]   will it die out or will it not?
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.400]   And if there's even one critical ingredient missing,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.340]   then it still doesn't count.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.460]   It's like, if you're on a long sea voyage
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.580]   and you've got everything except vitamin C,
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.260]   it's only a matter of time, you're gonna die.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.860]   So we gotta get a Mars city
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.820]   to the point where it's self-sustaining.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.860]   I'm not sure this will really happen in my lifetime,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:37.300]   but I hope to see it at least have a lot of momentum.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.540]   And then you could say, okay,
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.380]   what is the minimum tonnage necessary
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.060]   to have a self-sustaining city?
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.460]   And there's a lot of uncertainty about this.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.540]   You could say, I don't know,
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.420]   it's probably at least a million tons
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:55.460]   'cause you have to set up a lot of infrastructure on Mars.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.700]   Like I said, you can't be missing anything
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.980]   that in order to be self-sustaining,
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.460]   you can't be missing, like you need semiconductor fabs,
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.140]   you need iron ore refineries,
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.840]   like you need lots of things.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.460]   And Mars is not super hospitable.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.700]   It's the least inhospitable planet,
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.140]   but it's definitely a fixer-upper of a planet.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.380]   - Outside of Earth.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.220]   - Yes.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.180]   - Earth is pretty good. - Earth is like easy.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.500]   - And also we should clarify in the solar system.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.660]   - Yes, in the solar system.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.780]   - There might be nice vacation spots.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.140]   - There might be some great planets out there,
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.820]   but it's hopeless. - Too hard to get there?
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.660]   - Yeah, way, way, way, way, way too hard,
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.500]   to say the least.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.700]   - Let me push back on that.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.700]   Not really a pushback,
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.980]   but a quick curveball of a question.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.820]   So you did mention physics as the first starting point.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.820]   So general relativity allows for wormholes.
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.080]   They technically can exist.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.700]   Do you think those can ever be leveraged
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.100]   by humans to travel fast in the speed of light?
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.260]   - Well--
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.300]   - Are you saying--
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.620]   - The wormhole thing is debatable.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.220]   We currently do not know of any means
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.220]   of going faster than the speed of light.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.380]   There is like,
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:21.380]   there are some ideas about having space.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.380]   Like so, you can only move at the speed of light
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.720]   through space, but if you can make space itself move,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.520]   that's what we mean by space.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.580]   Space is capable of moving faster than the speed of light.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.740]   - Right.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.100]   - Like the universe, in the Big Bang,
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.620]   the universe expanded much more
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.820]   than the speed of light, by a lot.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.660]   - Yeah.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.680]   - So,
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.040]   but the,
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.660]   if this is possible,
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.660]   the amount of energy required to move space
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:03.100]   is so gigantic, it boggles the mind.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.060]   - So all the work you've done with propulsion,
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.100]   how much innovation is possible with rocket propulsion?
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.140]   Is this, I mean, you've seen it all,
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.420]   and you're constantly innovating in every aspect.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.340]   How much is possible?
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.380]   Like how much, can you get 10x somehow?
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.660]   Is there something in there, in physics,
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.220]   that you can get significant improvement
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.580]   in terms of efficiency of engines
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.620]   and all those kinds of things?
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.940]   - Well, as I was saying, really the Holy Grail
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.480]   is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital system.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.540]   So, right now,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.500]   the Falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out there.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.300]   But the booster comes back and lands,
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.180]   and you've seen the videos,
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.620]   and we get the nose cone or fairing back,
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.740]   but we do not get the upper stage back.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.580]   So,
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.260]   that means that we have a minimum cost
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.660]   of building an upper stage.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.300]   You can think of like a two-stage rocket
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.700]   of sort of like two airplanes,
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.180]   like a big airplane and a small airplane,
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.600]   and we get the big airplane back,
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.860]   but not the small airplane.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.860]   And so, it still costs a lot.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.340]   So, that upper stage is at least $10 million.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.460]   And then the degree of,
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.060]   the booster is not as rapidly and completely reusable
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.900]   as we'd like, nor are the fairings.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.140]   So, our kind of minimum marginal cost,
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.140]   not counting overhead, per flight
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   is on the order of $15 to $20 million, maybe.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.040]   So, that's extremely good for,
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.600]   it's by far better than any rocket ever in history.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.320]   But with full and rapid reusability,
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.800]   we can reduce the cost per time to orbit
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.820]   by a factor of 100.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.400]   But just think of it like,
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.140]   like imagine if you had an aircraft or something,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.880]   or a car,
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.920]   and if you had to buy a new car
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.080]   every time you went for a drive,
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.760]   it would be very expensive.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.320]   It would be silly, frankly.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   But in fact, you just refuel the car or recharge the car,
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.480]   and that makes your trip,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.320]   like, I don't know, a thousand times cheaper.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   So, it's the same for rockets.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.240]   Very difficult to make this complex machine
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.680]   that can go to orbit.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.560]   And so, if you cannot reuse it,
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.000]   and have to throw even any significant part of it away,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.660]   that massively increases the cost.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.320]   So, you know, Starship in theory
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.360]   could do a cost per launch of like a million,
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   maybe $2 million or something like that,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.520]   and put over 100 tons in orbit.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.560]   This is crazy.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.000]   - Yeah.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.960]   That's incredible.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.600]   So, you're saying like it's by far
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.720]   the biggest bang for the buck
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.720]   is to make it fully reusable,
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.160]   versus like some kind of brilliant breakthrough
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.780]   in theoretical physics.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.620]   - No, no.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.960]   There's no brilliant break, no.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.240]   There's no, just make the rocket reusable.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.480]   This is an extremely difficult engineering problem.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.320]   - Got it.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.720]   - But no new physics is required.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.320]   - Just brilliant engineering.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.200]   Let me ask a slightly philosophical fun question.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.040]   Gotta ask.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.840]   I know you're focused on getting to Mars,
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.720]   but once we're there on Mars,
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.960]   what form of government, economic system,
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.760]   political system do you think would work best
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.580]   for an early civilization of humans?
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:41.560]   I mean, the interesting reason to talk about this stuff,
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.320]   it also helps people dream about the future.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.560]   I know you're really focused
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.020]   about the short-term engineering dream,
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.280]   but it's like, I don't know,
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.680]   there's something about imagining
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.320]   an actual civilization on Mars
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.440]   that gives people, really gives people hope.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.960]   - Well, it would be a new frontier
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.640]   and an opportunity to rethink the whole nature of government
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.680]   just as was done in the creation of the United States.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   So, I mean, I would suggest having direct democracy,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:16.200]   like people vote directly on things
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.440]   as opposed to representative democracy.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.520]   So representative democracy, I think,
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.120]   is too subject to special interests
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.580]   and a coercion of the politicians and that kind of thing.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:36.320]   So I'd recommend that there's just direct democracy.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.560]   People vote on laws,
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.680]   the population votes on laws themselves,
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.520]   and then the laws must be short enough
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.880]   that people can understand them.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.920]   - Yeah, and then keeping a well-informed populace,
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.240]   like really being transparent about all the information,
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.080]   about what they're voting for.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.800]   - Yeah, absolute transparency.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.480]   - Yeah, and not make it as annoying as those cookies
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.800]   we have to accept.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.720]   - Accept cookies.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.640]   There's always a slight amount of trepidation
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.960]   when you click accept cookies.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.040]   I feel as though there's perhaps a very tiny chance
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.280]   that'll open a portal to hell or something like that.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.800]   - That's exactly how I feel.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.640]   - Why do they, why do they keep wanting me to accept it?
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.200]   What do they want with this cookie?
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.040]   Somebody got upset with accepting cookies
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.000]   or something somewhere, who cares?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.960]   It's so annoying to keep accepting all these cookies.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   - To me, this is just a great--
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.400]   - Yes, you can have my damn cookie, I don't care, whatever.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.960]   - Heard it from Yon first, he accepts all your damn cookies.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.800]   - Yeah.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.080]   (laughing)
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:38.920]   Stop asking me.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.400]   It's annoying.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:46.000]   - Yeah, it's one example of implementation
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.200]   of a good idea done really horribly.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.520]   - Yeah, it's somebody who has some good intentions
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.120]   of privacy or whatever, but now everyone just has
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.000]   to accept cookies and it's not, you have billions
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.720]   of people who have to keep clicking accept cookie,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.360]   it's super annoying.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.000]   Then just accept the damn cookie, it's fine.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.960]   There is, I think, a fundamental problem
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.280]   that because we've not really had a major,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.320]   like a world war or something like that in a while,
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.720]   and obviously we'd like to not have world wars,
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.800]   there's not been a cleansing function
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.360]   for rules and regulations.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.760]   So wars did have some sort of lining
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:29.000]   in that there would be a reset on rules
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.120]   and regulations after a war.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.000]   So World Wars I and II, there were huge resets
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.440]   on rules and regulations.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.400]   Now, if society does not have a war
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.720]   and there's no cleansing function or garbage collection
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.840]   for rules and regulations, then rules and regulations
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.440]   will accumulate every year 'cause they're immortal.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.320]   There's no actual, humans die, but the laws don't.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.160]   So we need a garbage collection function
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   for rules and regulations.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.480]   They should not just be immortal
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.000]   'cause some of the rules and regulations
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.920]   that are put in place will be counterproductive.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.720]   Done with good intentions, but counterproductive.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.600]   Sometimes not done with good intentions.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.520]   So if rules and regulations just accumulate every year
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.360]   and you get more and more of them,
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.840]   then eventually you won't be able to do anything.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.320]   You're just like Gulliver tied down
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.560]   by thousands of little strings.
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   And we see that in US and,
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:29.280]   like basically all economies that have been around
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:34.280]   for a while and regulators and legislators
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.560]   create new rules and regulations every year,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.680]   but they don't put effort into removing them.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.280]   And I think that's very important that we put effort
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.080]   into removing rules and regulations.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.560]   But it gets tough 'cause you get special interests
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.320]   that then are dependent on,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.520]   like they have a vested interest
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.920]   in that whatever rule and regulation
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.560]   and then they fight to not get it removed.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.360]   - Yeah, so I mean, I guess the problem
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:04.120]   with the constitution is it's kind of like C versus Java
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.720]   'cause it doesn't have any garbage collection built in.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.920]   I think there should be,
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.800]   when you first said that the metaphor of garbage collection,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.640]   I loved it. - Yeah, it's from
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.480]   a coding standpoint.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.320]   - From a coding standpoint, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.880]   It would be interesting if the laws themselves
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.040]   kind of had a built-in thing
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.720]   where they kind of die after a while
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.600]   unless somebody explicitly publicly defends them.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.240]   So that's sort of, it's not like somebody has to kill them,
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.160]   they kind of die themselves, they disappear.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.000]   - Yeah.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.640]   - Not to defend Java or anything, but C++,
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.520]   you could also have great garbage collection
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.920]   in Python and so on.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.760]   - Yeah, so yeah, something needs to happen
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.600]   or just the civilization's arteries just harden over time
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.840]   and you can just get less and less done
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.200]   because there's just a rule against everything.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.920]   So I think, I don't know, for Mars or whatever,
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.240]   I'd say, or even for, obviously for Earth as well,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.640]   like I think there should be an active process
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.960]   for removing rules and regulations
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.120]   and questioning their existence.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.280]   Just like if we've got a function
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.560]   for creating rules and regulations,
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.480]   'cause rules and regulations can also think of as like
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.800]   they're like software or lines of code
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.880]   for operating civilization.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.320]   That's the rules and regulations.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.000]   So it's not like we shouldn't have rules and regulations,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.120]   but you have code accumulation, but no code removal.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.960]   And so it just gets to become
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.280]   basically archaic bloatware after a while.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:37.920]   And it's just, it makes it hard for things to progress.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.320]   So I don't know, maybe Mars, you'd have like,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.560]   any given law must have a sunset
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:50.160]   and require active voting to restore,
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   to keep it up there.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.080]   And I actually also say like,
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.160]   and these are just, I don't know,
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.040]   recommendations or thoughts.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.680]   Ultimately, it will be up to the people on Mars to decide.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.680]   But I think it should be easier to remove a law
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.600]   than to add one because of the,
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.720]   just to overcome the inertia of laws.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.240]   So maybe it's like, for argument's sake,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.800]   you need like say 60% vote to have a law take effect,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.040]   but only a 40% vote to remove it.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.800]   - So let me be the guy,
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.640]   you posted a meme on Twitter recently
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.160]   where there's like a row of urinals
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.600]   and a guy just walks all the way across.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.440]   - Oh sure, yeah.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.640]   - And he tells you about crypto.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.320]   (laughing)
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.360]   - I mean, that's happened to me so many times.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.400]   I think maybe even literally.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.800]   - Yeah.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.480]   Do you think technologically speaking,
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.360]   there's any room for ideas of smart contracts or so on?
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.320]   'Cause you mentioned laws.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:53.000]   That's an interesting use of things like smart contracts
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   to implement the laws by which governments function.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.920]   Like something built on a theory
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   or maybe a dog coin that enables smart contracts somehow.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.280]   - I don't quite understand this whole smart contract thing.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.120]   You know?
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.960]   I mean, I'm too dumb to understand smart contracts.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.000]   - That's a good line.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   - I mean, my general approach to any kind of deal
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.280]   or whatever is just make sure
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.760]   there's clarity of understanding.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.800]   That's the most important thing.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.640]   And just keep any kind of deal very short and simple,
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.440]   plain language, and just make sure everyone understands
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.960]   this is the deal, is it clear?
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.800]   And what are the consequences
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.360]   if various things don't happen?
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:47.200]   But usually deals are, business deals or whatever,
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.920]   are way too long and complex and overly layered
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.720]   and pointlessly.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.040]   - You mentioned that Doge is the people's coin.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:57.880]   - Yeah.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.640]   - And you said that you were literally going,
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   SpaceX may consider literally putting a Doge coin
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.480]   on the moon.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.960]   Is this something you're still considering?
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   Mars, perhaps?
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.640]   Do you think there's some chance,
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.080]   we've talked about political systems on Mars,
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.240]   that Doge coin is the official currency of Mars
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.680]   at some point in the future?
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.400]   - Well, I think Mars itself will need
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.040]   to have a different currency
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.320]   because you can't synchronize due to speed of light.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.680]   Or not easily.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.080]   - So it must be completely standalone from Earth.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:41.320]   - Well, yeah, 'cause Mars, at closest approach,
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.000]   it's four light minutes away, roughly.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   And then at furthest approach,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.480]   it's roughly 20 light minutes away, maybe a little more.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   So you can't really have something synchronizing
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.480]   if you've got a 20 minute speed of light issue,
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.200]   if it's got a one minute blockchain.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.000]   It's not gonna synchronize properly.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.960]   So Mars would, I don't know if Mars would have
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.040]   a cryptocurrency as a thing, but probably.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.640]   Seems likely.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.240]   But it would be some kind of localized thing on Mars.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.920]   - And you let the people decide.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.520]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.760]   The future of Mars should be up to the Martians.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.600]   Yeah, so.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.800]   I mean, I think the cryptocurrency thing
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   is an interesting approach to reducing the error
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.060]   in the database that is called money.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:42.920]   I think I have a pretty deep understanding
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.760]   of what money actually is on a practical day-to-day basis
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.080]   because of PayPal.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.960]   We really got in deep there.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:57.280]   And right now, the money system,
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.120]   actually for practical purposes,
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:04.080]   is really a bunch of heterogeneous mainframes
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.800]   running old COBOL.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.720]   - Okay, you mean literally?
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:09.560]   - Literally.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.840]   - That's literally what's happening.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.680]   - In batch mode.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.600]   Okay.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.440]   - In batch mode.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   - Yeah, pretty the poor bastards
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.000]   who have to maintain that code.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.240]   Okay, that's a pain.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.240]   - Not even Fortran's COBOL, yep.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.080]   - It's COBOL.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:30.120]   And banks are still buying mainframes in 2021
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.040]   and running ancient COBOL code.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:37.800]   And the Federal Reserve is probably even older
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.960]   than what the banks have,
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.080]   and they have an old COBOL mainframe.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:46.960]   And so the government effectively has editing privileges
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.660]   on the money database.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:51.520]   And they use those editing privileges
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.700]   to make more money whenever they want.
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:00.020]   And this increases the error in the database that is money.
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:01.820]   So I think money should really be viewed
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.580]   through the lens of information theory.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.260]   And so it's kind of like an internet connection.
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.500]   Like what's the bandwidth, total bit rate,
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:17.220]   what is the latency, jitter, packet drop,
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:21.780]   errors in network communication.
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:25.460]   So you think money like that, basically.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.420]   I think that's probably the right way to think of it.
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.640]   And then say what system,
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.900]   from an information theory standpoint,
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.180]   allows an economy to function the best.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:41.540]   And crypto is an attempt to reduce the error in money
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:50.740]   that is contributed by governments
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.260]   diluting the money supply
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:57.180]   as basically a pernicious form of taxation.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.860]   - So both policy in terms of with inflation
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:05.740]   and actual technological COBOL,
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.860]   like cryptocurrency takes us into the 21st century
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.700]   in terms of the actual systems
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.100]   that allow you to do the transaction,
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.200]   to store wealth, all those kinds of things.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.540]   - Like I said, just think of money as information.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.860]   People often will think of money
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.700]   as having power in and of itself.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.960]   It does not.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.820]   Money is information.
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.860]   And it does not have power in and of itself.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:35.020]   Like applying the physics tools
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.500]   of thinking about things in the limit is helpful.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.980]   If you are stranded on a tropical island
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:45.600]   and you have a trillion dollars, it's useless.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.540]   'Cause there's no resource allocation.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.660]   Money is a database resource allocation.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.020]   There's no resource to allocate except yourself.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.060]   So money is useless.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:04.100]   If you're stranded on a desert island with no food,
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:10.660]   all the Bitcoin in the world will not stop you from starving.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:20.820]   So just think of money as a database
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.000]   for resource allocation across time and space.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:36.160]   In what form should that database or data system,
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.060]   what would be most effective?
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:42.980]   Now, there is a fundamental issue with, say,
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.020]   Bitcoin in its current form,
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.740]   in that the transaction volume is very limited.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:55.700]   And the latency for a properly confirmed transaction
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:00.140]   is too long, much longer than you'd like.
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.180]   So it's actually not great
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.980]   from a transaction volume standpoint
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.520]   or a latency standpoint.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:14.140]   So it is perhaps useful to solve an aspect
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.180]   of the money database problem,
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.940]   which is this sort of store of wealth
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:24.700]   or an accounting of relative obligations, I suppose.
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:29.420]   But it is not useful as a currency,
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:30.820]   as a day-to-day currency.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.900]   - But people have proposed
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.340]   different technological solutions.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.340]   - Like Lightning.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.760]   - Yeah, Lightning Network and the Layer 2 technologies
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.600]   on top of that.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:40.860]   It seems to be all kind of a trade-off,
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.140]   but the point is, it's kind of brilliant to say
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.500]   that just think about information,
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.180]   think about what kind of database,
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.060]   what kind of infrastructure enables
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:48.900]   that exchange of information. - Yeah, so say like
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.200]   you're operating an economy,
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:55.300]   and you need to have something that allows
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.740]   for the efficient, to have efficient value ratios
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.380]   between products and services.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.900]   So you've got this massive number of products and services,
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.300]   and you need to, you can't just barter.
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.620]   That would be extremely unwieldy.
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.100]   So you need something that gives you
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:19.240]   a ratio of exchange between goods and services.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.620]   And then something that allows you
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:26.620]   to shift obligations across time, like debt,
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.220]   debt and equity shift obligations across time.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.380]   Then what does the best job of that?
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.180]   Part of the reason why I think
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.060]   there's some merit to Dogecoin,
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.500]   even though it was obviously created as a joke,
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:44.980]   is that it actually does have a much higher
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.340]   transaction volume capability than Bitcoin.
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:53.020]   And the costs of doing a transaction,
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:56.020]   the Dogecoin fee is very low.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.260]   Like right now, if you want to do a Bitcoin transaction,
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.460]   the price of doing that transaction is very high.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:04.380]   So you could not use it effectively for most things.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.900]   And nor could it even scale to a high volume.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:14.020]   And when Bitcoin was started,
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.220]   I guess around 2008 or something like that,
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:20.860]   the internet connections were much worse than they are today.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.580]   Like order of magnitude, I mean,
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.860]   they're way, way worse in 2008.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:31.860]   So like having a small block size or whatever is,
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.660]   and a long synchronization time is,
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:37.780]   made sense in 2008.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.500]   But 2021, or fast forward 10 years,
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:45.380]   it's like economically low.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:55.540]   And I think there's some value to having a linear increase
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:58.620]   in the amount of currency that is generated.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:02.940]   So because some amount of the currency,
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:06.340]   if a currency is too deflationary,
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.820]   or like, or should say,
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:12.820]   if a currency is expected to increase in value over time,
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.180]   there's reluctance to spend it.
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:18.500]   'Cause you're like, oh, I'll just hold it and not spend it
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.580]   because it's scarcity is increasing with time.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.380]   So if I spend it now, then I will regret spending it.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:26.020]   So I will just, you know, hodl it.
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:30.940]   But if there's some dilution of the currency occurring
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.820]   over time, that's more of an incentive
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:34.260]   to use it as a currency.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.860]   So those coins, somewhat randomly,
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:41.860]   has just a fixed number of sort of coins
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:49.620]   or hash strings that are generated every year.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:52.780]   So there's some inflation, but it's not a percentage base.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.700]   It's a fixed number.
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.380]   So the percentage of inflation
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.140]   will necessarily decline over time.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.580]   So it just, I'm not saying that it's like the ideal system
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.500]   for a currency, but I think it actually is
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.460]   just fundamentally better than anything else I've seen,
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.380]   just by accident.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.620]   So.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.740]   - I like how you said around 2008,
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.420]   so you're not, you know, some people suggested,
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.860]   you might be Satoshi Nakamoto,
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.060]   you've previously said you're not.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.780]   Let me ask, you're not for sure.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:30.140]   Would you tell us if you were?
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.980]   - Yes.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.820]   - Okay.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.780]   Do you think it's a feature or bug
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.260]   that he's anonymous or she or they?
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:41.680]   It's an interesting kind of quirk of human history
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.580]   that there is a particular technology
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.020]   that is a completely anonymous inventor or creator.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:52.020]   - Well, I mean, you can look at the evolution of ideas
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:01:11.860]   before the launch of Bitcoin
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:17.860]   and see who wrote about those ideas.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:22.820]   And then, I don't know exactly,
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.180]   obviously I don't know who created Bitcoin
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.100]   for practical purposes,
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.940]   but the evolution of ideas is pretty clear before that.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.020]   And it seems as though Nick Szabo
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.240]   is probably more than anyone else responsible
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.060]   for the evolution of those ideas.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.900]   So he claims not to be Nakamoto,
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.380]   but I'm not sure that's neither here nor there.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.300]   But he seems to be the one more responsible
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.900]   for the ideas behind Bitcoin than anyone else.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.360]   - So it's not, perhaps singular figures
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.260]   aren't even as important as the figures involved
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.620]   in the evolution of ideas that led to a thing.
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.460]   - Yeah.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.500]   - Yeah, you know.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.620]   And perhaps it's sad to think about history,
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.900]   but maybe most names will be forgotten anyway.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.020]   - What is a name anyway?
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.720]   It's a name attached to an idea.
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.680]   - What does it even mean really?
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.240]   - I think Shakespeare had a thing about roses and stuff,
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.200]   whatever he said.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.480]   - Rose by any other name, it smells sweet.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:24.280]   - I got Elon to quote Shakespeare.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.880]   I feel like I accomplished something today.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.920]   - Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.800]   (laughing)
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.100]   - I'm gonna clip that out.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.000]   (laughing)
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.800]   - Not more temperate and more fair.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.040]   (laughing)
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.440]   - Autopilot, Tesla Autopilot.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.680]   (laughing)
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.520]   Tesla Autopilot has been through an incredible journey
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.540]   over the past six years,
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.520]   or perhaps even longer in your mind
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.180]   and the minds of many involved.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.000]   - I think that's where we first connected really
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.920]   was the Autopilot stuff, autonomy.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.940]   - The whole journey was incredible to me to watch.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.360]   Because I knew, well, part of it is I was at MIT
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.200]   and I knew the difficulty of computer vision.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.800]   And I knew the whole, I had a lot of colleagues and friends
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.440]   about the DARPA challenge and knew how difficult it is.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.160]   And so there was a natural skepticism.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.720]   When I first drove a Tesla with the initial system
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.540]   based on Mobileye, I thought there's no way.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.920]   So at first when I got in, I thought there's no way
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.180]   this car could maintain, like stay in the lane
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.900]   and create a comfortable experience.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.520]   So my intuition initially was that the lane keeping problem
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.760]   is way too difficult to solve.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.160]   - Oh, lane keeping, yeah, that's relatively easy.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.440]   - Well, but solve in the way that we just,
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.640]   we talked about previous is prototype versus a thing
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.400]   that actually creates a pleasant experience
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.480]   over hundreds of thousands of miles and millions.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.360]   Yeah, so I was proven wrong pretty quickly.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.720]   - We had to wrap a lot of code around the Mobileye thing.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.400]   It doesn't just work by itself.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.420]   - I mean, that's part of the story
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.980]   of how you approach things sometimes.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.680]   Sometimes you do things from scratch.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.460]   Sometimes at first you kind of see what's out there
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.340]   and then you decide to do from scratch.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:17.180]   That was one of the boldest decisions I've seen
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.820]   is both on the hardware and the software
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.000]   to decide to eventually go from scratch.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.700]   I thought, again, I was skeptical
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.500]   whether that's going to be able to work out
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.860]   'cause it's such a difficult problem.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.900]   And so it was an incredible journey.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.500]   What I see now with everything, the hardware, the compute,
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:37.300]   the sensors, the things I maybe care and love about most
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.040]   is the stuff that Andrej Karpathy is leading
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.100]   with the data set selection, the whole data engine process,
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.020]   the neural network architectures,
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.300]   the way that's in the real world,
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.380]   that network is tested, validated,
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.920]   all the different test sets,
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.740]   versus the ImageNet model of computer vision,
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.220]   like what's in academia
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.740]   is like real world artificial intelligence.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:04.220]   And Andrej's awesome and obviously plays an important role,
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.760]   but we have a lot of really talented people driving things.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.740]   And Ashok is actually the head of autopilot engineering.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.380]   Andrej is the director of AI.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.700]   - AI stuff, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.580]   So yeah, I'm aware that there's an incredible team
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.060]   of just a lot going on.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.020]   - Yeah, just, you know,
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.020]   obviously people will give me too much credit
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.660]   and they'll give Andrej too much credit.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.660]   - And people should realize how much is going on
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.380]   under the hood. - Yeah, it's just a lot
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.680]   of really talented people.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:40.000]   The Tesla Autopilot AI team is extremely talented.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.540]   It's like some of the smartest people in the world.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.020]   So yeah, we're getting it done.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.620]   - What are some insights you've gained
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:51.260]   over those five, six years of autopilot
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.220]   about the problem of autonomous driving?
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:59.220]   So you leaped in having some sort of first principles,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:02.980]   kinds of intuitions, but nobody knows how difficult
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.540]   the problem-- - Yeah.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.220]   - Like the problem-- - I thought the self-driving
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.940]   problem would be hard, but it was harder than I thought.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.900]   It's not like I thought it would be easy.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.740]   I thought it would be very hard,
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:14.140]   but it was actually way harder than even that.
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.980]   So I mean, what it comes down to at the end of the day
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.680]   is to solve self-driving, you have to solve,
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:27.660]   you basically need to recreate what humans do to drive,
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.500]   which is humans drive with optical sensors,
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.800]   eyes, and biological neural nets.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.860]   And so in order to, that's how the entire road system
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:42.860]   is designed to work, with basically passive optical
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:46.060]   and neural nets, biologically.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.460]   And now that we need to, so for actually
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.020]   for full self-driving to work, we have to recreate that
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:51.880]   in digital form.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:57.460]   So we have to, that means cameras with advanced
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:02.560]   neural nets in silicon form.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.940]   And then it will obviously solve for full self-driving.
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.260]   That's the only way, I don't think there's any other way.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.880]   - But the question is, what aspects of human nature
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.500]   do you have to encode into the machine, right?
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.740]   So you have to solve the perception problem, like detect,
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:22.340]   and then you first, well, realize what is the perception
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.220]   problem for driving, like all the kinds of things
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.420]   you have to be able to see.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.900]   Like what do we even look at when we drive?
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.420]   There's, I just recently heard Andre talked about at MIT
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.560]   about car doors, I think it was the world's greatest talk
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.020]   of all time about car doors.
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:37.860]   - Yeah.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:41.380]   - The fine details of car doors.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:44.420]   Like what is even an open car door, man?
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:47.980]   So like the ontology of that, that's a perception problem.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.860]   We humans solve that perception problem,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.620]   and Tesla has to solve that problem.
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.380]   And then there's the control and the planning
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.980]   coupled with the perception.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:58.300]   You have to figure out like what's involved in driving,
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.880]   like especially in all the different edge cases.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:06.540]   And then, I mean, maybe you can comment on this,
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.460]   how much game theoretic kind of stuff needs to be involved,
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.700]   you know, at a four-way stop sign.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:18.060]   As humans, when we drive, our actions affect the world.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.780]   Like it changes how others behave.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:25.220]   Most autonomous driving, you're usually just responding
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:30.980]   to the scene as opposed to like really asserting yourself
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.820]   in the scene.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.140]   Do you think?
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:37.580]   - I think these sort of control logic conundrums
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.340]   are not the hard part.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:43.900]   Let's see.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.860]   - What do you think is the hard part
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:50.580]   in this whole beautiful, complex problem?
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.980]   - So it's a lot of frigging software, man.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.420]   A lot of smart lines of code.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:59.660]   For sure, in order to have,
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.980]   create an accurate vector space.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:08.280]   So like you're coming from image space,
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.580]   which is like this flow of photons,
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:14.420]   you're going to the cameras,
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   and then you have this massive bit stream in image space,
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:26.780]   and then you have to effectively compress
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:34.580]   a massive bit stream corresponding to photons
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:41.380]   that knocked off an electron in a camera sensor,
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:45.280]   and turn that bit stream into vector space.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.600]   By vector space, I mean like,
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:56.620]   you've got cars and humans and lane lines and curves
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:02.380]   and traffic lights and that kind of thing.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:08.500]   Once you have an accurate vector space,
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.680]   the control problem is similar to that of a video game,
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.100]   like a Grand Theft Auto or Cyberpunk,
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.260]   if you have accurate vector space.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.700]   It's the control problem is,
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.300]   I wouldn't say it's trivial, it's not trivial,
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:25.300]   but it's not like some insurmountable thing.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:32.140]   Having an accurate vector space is very difficult.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.540]   - Yeah, I think we humans don't give enough respect
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.900]   to how incredible the human perception system is,
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.500]   to mapping the raw photons
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.660]   to the vector space representation in our heads.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:47.420]   - Your brain is doing an incredible amount of processing
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.360]   and giving you an image that is a very cleaned up image.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.380]   Like when we look around here,
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.340]   like you see color in the corners of your eyes,
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:59.420]   but actually your eyes have very few cones,
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.260]   like cone receptors in the peripheral vision.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:05.700]   Your eyes are painting color in the peripheral vision.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:06.520]   You don't realize it,
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.060]   but their eyes are actually painting color.
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.280]   And your eyes also have like this blood vessels
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.660]   and also some gnarly things, and there's a blind spot,
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.380]   but do you see your blind spot?
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.180]   No, your brain is painting in the missing, the blind spot.
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.820]   You're gonna do these like,
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.980]   see these things online where you look here
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.380]   and look at this point and then look at this point.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.480]   And if it's in your blind spot,
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.660]   your brain will just fill in the missing bits.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.220]   - The peripheral vision is so cool.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.180]   - Yeah. - Makes you realize all the illusions
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.020]   for vision science,
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.640]   and so it makes you realize just how incredible the brain is.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   - The brain is doing crazy amount of post-processing
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.760]   on the vision signals for your eyes.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.680]   It's insane.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.920]   So, and then even once you get all those vision signals,
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.720]   your brain is constantly trying
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.720]   to forget as much as possible.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.520]   So human memory is,
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.920]   perhaps the weakest thing about the brain is memory.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.280]   So because memory is so expensive to our brain
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.700]   and so limited,
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.780]   your brain is trying to forget as much as possible
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:12.180]   and distill the things that you see
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:16.540]   into the smallest amounts of information possible.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.380]   So your brain is trying to not just get to a vector space,
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.920]   but get to a vector space
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.580]   that is the smallest possible vector space
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.080]   of only relevant objects.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.900]   And I think like, you can sort of look inside your brain,
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.340]   or at least I can,
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.160]   like when you drive down the road
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.960]   and try to think about what your brain
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.980]   is actually doing consciously.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:43.980]   And it's like, you'll see a car,
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.600]   because you don't have cameras,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.980]   you don't have eyes in the back of your head or the side.
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:49.820]   So you say like,
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.180]   you basically, your head is like a,
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:56.840]   you basically have like two cameras on a slow gimbal.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.340]   And what's your,
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.700]   and eyesight's not that great.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.900]   Okay, human eyes are,
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.740]   and people are constantly distracted
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.220]   and thinking about things and texting
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.300]   and doing all sorts of things they shouldn't do in a car,
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.980]   changing the radio station.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:15.060]   So having arguments is like,
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.140]   so then like, say like,
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.020]   like when's the last time you looked right and left
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.340]   and, or and rearward,
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:28.420]   or even diagonally forward
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.220]   to actually refresh your vector space.
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.420]   So you're glancing around
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:35.940]   and what your mind is doing is trying to still,
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.460]   relevant vectors,
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.200]   basically objects with a position and motion,
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:47.860]   and then editing that down to the least amount
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.940]   that's necessary for you to drive.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.260]   - It does seem to be able to edit it down
[01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:55.780]   or compress it even further into things like concepts.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:57.660]   So it's not, it's like it goes beyond,
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:01.260]   the human mind seems to go sometimes beyond vector space
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.100]   to sort of space of concepts to where you'll see a thing.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.540]   It's no longer represented spatially somehow.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.080]   It's almost like a concept that you should be aware of.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.340]   Like if this is a school zone,
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.940]   you'll remember that as a concept,
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.420]   which is a weird thing to represent,
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.500]   but perhaps for driving,
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.460]   you don't need to fully represent those things.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.900]   Or maybe you get those kind of indirectly.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.740]   - You need to establish vector space
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:32.740]   and then actually have predictions for those vector spaces.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:39.100]   So like if you drive past, say a bus,
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:47.340]   and you see that there's people,
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.500]   before you drove past the bus,
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.260]   you saw people crossing,
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.820]   or just imagine there's a large truck
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.220]   or something blocking site,
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.420]   but before you came out to the truck,
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:00.700]   you saw that there were some kids about to cross the road
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.540]   in front of the truck.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.220]   Now you can no longer see the kids,
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.940]   but you need to be able,
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:05.940]   but you would now know,
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.980]   okay, those kids are probably gonna pass by the truck
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.980]   and cross the road, even though you cannot see them.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.920]   So you have to have memory,
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.060]   you have to need to remember that there were kids there
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.780]   and you need to have some forward prediction
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.940]   of what their position will be--
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:24.780]   - That's a really hard problem.
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.620]   - At the time of relevance.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.500]   - So with occlusions and computer vision,
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.820]   when you can't see an object anymore,
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.420]   even when it just walks behind a tree and reappears,
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.100]   that's a really, really,
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   I mean, at least in academic literature,
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.600]   it's tracking through occlusions, it's very difficult.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.940]   - Yeah, we're doing it.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.460]   - I understand this.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.300]   So some of it--
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:45.380]   - It's like object permanence,
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.700]   like same thing happens with the humans with neural nets.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.580]   Like when a toddler grows up,
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:54.420]   there's a point in time where they develop,
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.200]   they have a sense of object permanence.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.380]   So before a certain age,
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.940]   if you have a ball or a toy or whatever,
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.640]   and you put it behind your back and you pop it out,
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.660]   if they don't, before they have object permanence,
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.860]   it's like a new thing every time.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.260]   It's like, whoa, this toy went, poof, disappeared,
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:09.980]   and now it's back again, and they can't believe it.
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.140]   And that they can play peekaboo all day long
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.940]   because peekaboo is fresh every time.
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.220]   (both laughing)
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.220]   But then we figured out object permanence,
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.360]   then they realize, oh no, the object is not gone,
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.760]   it's just behind your back.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.380]   - Sometimes I wish we never did figure out object permanence.
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.740]   - Yeah, so that's--
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:31.620]   - That's an important problem to solve.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.960]   - Yes, so like an important evolution
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.740]   of the neural nets in the car is
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:43.860]   memory across both time and space.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.620]   So now you can't remember,
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.460]   like you have to say,
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.940]   like how long do you want to remember things for?
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:53.260]   And there's a cost to remembering things for a long time.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.720]   So you run out of memory
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.100]   to try to remember too much for too long.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:01.240]   And then you also have things that are stale
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.540]   if you remember them for too long.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.880]   And then you also need things that are remembered over time.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.640]   So even if you, like say, have like,
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.580]   for argument's sake, five seconds of memory on a time basis,
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:17.080]   but like, let's say you're parked at a light,
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.640]   and you saw, use a pedestrian example,
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:25.200]   that people were waiting to cross the road,
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.900]   and you can't quite see them because of an occlusion,
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.560]   but they might wait for a minute
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.160]   before the light changes for them to cross the road.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.920]   You still need to remember that that's where they were,
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.040]   and that they're probably going to cross the road
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.580]   type of thing.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.720]   So even if that exceeds your time-based memory,
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.020]   it should not exceed your space memory.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:50.520]   - And I just think the data engine side of that,
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.520]   so getting the data to learn all of the concepts
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.200]   that you're saying now is an incredible process.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.400]   It's this iterative process of just,
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.680]   it's this hydranet of many--
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.520]   - Hydranet.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.400]   We're changing the name to something else.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.720]   - Okay, I'm sure it'll be equally as Rick and Morty-like.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.480]   - There's a lot of, yeah.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.760]   We've re-architected the neural net,
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.000]   the neural nets in the cars so many times, it's crazy.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.040]   - Oh, so every time there's a new major version,
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.960]   you'll rename it to something more ridiculous,
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.560]   or memorable and beautiful?
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.340]   Sorry, not ridiculous, of course.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:32.520]   - If you see the full array of neural nets
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.440]   that are operating in the car, it kind of boggles the mind.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.520]   There's so many layers, it's crazy.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.920]   So, yeah.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:48.880]   We started off with simple neural nets
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.880]   that were basically image recognition on a single frame
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:59.880]   from a single camera, and then trying to net those together
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.360]   with C.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.680]   I should say we're really primarily running C here,
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.000]   'cause C++ is too much overhead.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.640]   And we have our own C compiler.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.560]   So, to get maximum performance,
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.800]   we actually wrote our own C compiler
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.040]   and are continuing to optimize our C compiler
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.040]   for maximum efficiency.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.000]   In fact, we've just recently done a new rev
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.240]   on our C compiler that'll compile directly
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.960]   to our autopilot hardware.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.960]   - So you wanna compile the whole thing down
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.440]   with your own compiler.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.640]   - Yeah, absolutely. - So efficiency here,
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.960]   'cause there's all kinds of compute, there's CPU, GPU,
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.360]   there's basic types of things,
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.080]   and you have to somehow figure out the scheduling
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.120]   across all of those things.
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.040]   And so you're compiling the code down.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.480]   - Yeah. - It does all, okay.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.800]   So that's why there's a lot of people involved.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.600]   - There's a lot of hardcore software engineering
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.680]   at a very sort of bare metal level,
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.240]   'cause we're trying to do a lot of compute
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:02.240]   that's constrained to our full self-driving computer.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.760]   And we wanna try to have the highest frames per second
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:12.560]   possible with a sort of very finite amount
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.160]   of compute and power.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:19.800]   So we really put a lot of effort
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.720]   into the efficiency of our compute.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.040]   And so there's actually a lot of work done
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.640]   by some very talented software engineers at Tesla
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.120]   that at a very foundational level
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.200]   to improve the efficiency of compute
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.920]   and how we use the trip accelerators,
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.920]   which are basically doing matrix math dot products,
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.360]   like a bazillion dot products.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.560]   And it's like, what are neural nets?
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.160]   It's like, compute-wise, like 99% dot products.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.320]   (laughs)
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.040]   So, you know.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.680]   - And you wanna achieve as many high frame rates,
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.560]   like a video game.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.960]   You want full resolution, high frame rate.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:09.960]   - High frame rate, low latency, low jitter.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:16.000]   So I think one of the things
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.560]   we're moving towards now is no post-processing
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:25.560]   of the image through the image signal processor.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:31.680]   So like, what happens for cameras is that,
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.280]   well, almost all cameras is they,
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.720]   there's a lot of post-processing done
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.280]   in order to make pictures look pretty.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.040]   And so we don't care about pictures looking pretty.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.400]   We just want the data.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.800]   So we're moving to just raw photon counts.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:52.640]   So the system will, like the image
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:56.360]   that the computer sees is actually much more
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.080]   than what you'd see if you represented it on a camera.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.800]   It's got much more data.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.560]   And even in very low light conditions,
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.240]   you can see that there's a small photon count difference
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:08.800]   between this spot here and that spot there,
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.920]   which means that, so it can see in the dark incredibly well
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.160]   because it can detect these tiny differences
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.160]   in photon counts.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.840]   Like much better than you could possibly imagine.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:25.800]   So, and then we also save 13 milliseconds on a latency.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.280]   So--
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.240]   - From removing the post-processing in the image?
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:32.080]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:35.840]   - It's like, 'cause we've got eight cameras
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.800]   and then there's roughly, I don't know,
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.000]   one and a half milliseconds or so,
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.240]   maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency for each camera.
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.240]   And so like going to just,
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.320]   basically bypassing the image processor
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.320]   gets us back 13 milliseconds of latency, which is important.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.440]   And we track latency all the way from,
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:07.400]   photon hits the camera to all the steps
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.080]   that it's gotta go through to get,
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.320]   go through the various neural nets and the C code.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.540]   And there's a little bit of C++ there as well.
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:21.360]   Well, maybe a lot, but the core stuff is,
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.080]   the heavy duty computers all in C.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:28.840]   And so we track that latency all the way
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:32.000]   to an output command to the drive unit
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.600]   to accelerate the brakes, just to slow down the steering,
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.040]   you know, turn left or right.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.680]   So, 'cause you got to output a command
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.800]   that's gonna go to a controller.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.120]   And like some of these controllers have an update frequency
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:47.280]   that's maybe 10 Hertz or something like that, which is slow.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.240]   That's like, now you lose a hundred milliseconds potentially.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:55.240]   So then we wanna update the drivers on the,
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.720]   like say steering and braking control
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.920]   to have more like a hundred Hertz instead of 10 Hertz.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.400]   And you've got a 10 millisecond latency
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.400]   instead of a hundred milliseconds, worst case latency.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:09.520]   And actually jitter is more of a challenge than latency.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.080]   'Cause latency is like, you can anticipate and predict,
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.680]   but if you've got a stack up of things
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.200]   going from the camera to the computer,
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.400]   through then a series of other computers,
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.120]   and finally to an actuator on the car.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.960]   If you have a stack up of tolerances, of timing tolerances,
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:29.000]   then you can have quite a variable latency,
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.360]   which is called jitter.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   And that makes it hard to anticipate exactly
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.440]   how you should turn the car or accelerate.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.560]   Because if you've got maybe a hundred,
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.400]   a 50, 200 milliseconds of jitter,
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.560]   then you could be off by up to 0.2 seconds.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.560]   And this could make a big difference.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.880]   - So you have to interpolate somehow
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:52.400]   to deal with the effects of jitter.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.940]   So you can make like robust control decisions.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.600]   Yeah, so the jitter is in the sensor information
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.960]   or the jitter can occur at any stage in the pipeline.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.760]   - You can, if you have just, if you have fixed latency,
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.920]   you can anticipate and like say, okay,
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:16.520]   we know that our information is for argument's sake,
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.000]   150 milliseconds stale.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.080]   Like, so for argument's sake,
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.720]   150 milliseconds from photon second camera
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.480]   to where you can measure a change
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.820]   in the acceleration of the vehicle.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:37.200]   So then you can say, okay, well, we're gonna,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.400]   we know it's 150 milliseconds,
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.960]   so we're gonna take that into account
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.240]   and compensate for that latency.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.320]   However, if you've got then 150 milliseconds of latency
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.640]   plus 100 milliseconds of jitter,
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:51.000]   which could be anywhere from zero
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.520]   to 100 milliseconds on top,
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.760]   so then your latency could be from 150 to 250 milliseconds.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.720]   Now you've got 100 milliseconds
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.320]   that you don't know what to do with.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.940]   And that's basically random.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:04.280]   So getting rid of jitter is extremely important.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.880]   - And that affects your control decisions
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.900]   and all those kinds of things, okay.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:11.160]   - Yeah, the car's just gonna fundamentally maneuver better
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.000]   with lower jitter.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.760]   - Got it.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.760]   - And the cars will maneuver with superhuman ability
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.020]   and reaction time much faster than a human.
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:21.960]   I mean, I think over time,
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.880]   the autopilot, the full self-driving
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.800]   will be capable of maneuvers that
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:34.840]   are far more than what James Bond could do
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.400]   in the best movie type of thing.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.440]   - That's exactly what I was imagining in my mind,
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.280]   as you said.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.120]   - It's like impossible maneuvers that a human couldn't do.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.680]   - Well, let me ask sort of looking back the six years,
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.240]   looking out into the future,
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.800]   based on your current understanding,
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.360]   how hard do you think this full self-driving problem,
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.780]   when do you think Tesla will solve level four FSD?
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.300]   - I mean, it's looking quite likely
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.600]   that it will be next year.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.000]   - And what does the solution look like?
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.160]   Is it the current pool of FSD beta candidates,
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.120]   they start getting greater and greater
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.720]   as they have been degrees of autonomy,
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.680]   and then there's a certain level beyond which
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:22.840]   they can do their own, they can read a book.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.480]   - Yeah, so, I mean, you can see that
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.320]   anybody who's been following the full self-driving beta
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:34.320]   closely will see that the rate of disengagements
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.400]   has been dropping rapidly.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.680]   So like a disengagement B where the driver intervenes
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.080]   to prevent the car from doing something.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.520]   That's dangerous potentially.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:53.200]   So the interventions per million miles
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.160]   has been dropping dramatically.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.760]   At some point, and that trend looks like
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.200]   it happens next year, is that the probability
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:09.200]   of an accident on FSD is less than that of the average human,
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.920]   and then significantly less than that of the average human.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.920]   So it certainly appears like we will get there next year.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:24.760]   Then of course, then there's gonna be a case of,
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.840]   okay, well, we now have to prove this to regulators
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.440]   and prove it to, and we want a standard
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.900]   that is not just equivalent to a human,
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.240]   but much better than the average human.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.920]   I think it's gotta be at least two or three times
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.000]   higher safety than a human.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.360]   So two or three times lower probability of injury
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.840]   than a human before we would actually say like,
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.920]   okay, it's okay to go.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.360]   It's not gonna be equivalent, it's gonna be much better.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:52.840]   - So if you look at 10 point, FSD 10.6 just came out
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.440]   recently, 10.7 is on the way.
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.440]   Maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the future.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.040]   - Yeah, we were hoping to get 11 out this year,
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.880]   but it's, 11 actually has a whole bunch
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:09.460]   of fundamental rewrites on the neural net architecture,
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:15.840]   and some fundamental improvements in creating vector space.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.320]   So--
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.240]   - There is some fundamental leap
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.960]   that really deserves the 11.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.160]   I mean, that's a pretty cool number.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.000]   - Yeah.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.040]   11 would be a single stack for all,
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.400]   one stack to rule them all.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:38.600]   But there are just some really fundamental
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:44.720]   neural net architecture changes that will allow
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:49.720]   for much more capability, but at first
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.120]   they're gonna have issues.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.680]   So like we have this working on like sort of alpha software
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:59.680]   and it's good, but it's basically taking a whole bunch
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.600]   of C, C++ code and deleting a massive amount
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.440]   of C++ code and replacing it with a neural net.
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.160]   And Andre makes this point a lot,
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.500]   which is like neural nets are kind of eating software.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:15.880]   Over time there's like less and less conventional software,
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:18.260]   more and more neural net, which is still software,
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:21.100]   but it's, still comes out the lines of software,
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:26.100]   but more neural net stuff and less heuristics basically.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:36.280]   If you're, more matrix-based stuff
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.120]   and less heuristics-based stuff.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:47.660]   And, you know, like one of the big changes will be,
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:55.900]   like right now the neural nets will deliver
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:03.720]   a giant bag of points to the C++ or C and C++ code.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.020]   - Yeah.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.400]   - We call it the giant bag of points.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.240]   - Yeah.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.660]   - And it's like, so you've got a pixel
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:13.140]   and something associated with that pixel.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:14.980]   Like this pixel is probably car,
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:16.960]   this pixel is probably lane line.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.460]   Then you've got to assemble this giant bag of points
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:24.380]   in the C code and turn it into vectors.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:28.820]   And we're just a pretty good job of it,
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   but it's, we want to just, we need another layer
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.420]   of neural nets on top of that to take the giant bag
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:42.360]   of points and distill that down to vector space
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:45.320]   in the neural net part of the software,
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.680]   as opposed to the heuristics part of the software.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.080]   This is a big improvement.
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.120]   - Neural nets all the way down, is what you want.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.200]   - It's not even neural, all neural nets,
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.920]   but it's, this will be just a, this is a game changer
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:02.800]   to not have the bag of points, the giant bag of points
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.800]   that has to be assembled with many lines of C++
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:10.240]   and have the, and have a neural net
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.200]   just assemble those into a vector.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:17.200]   So the neural net is outputting much, much less data.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.680]   It's outputting, this is a lane line, this is a curb,
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.480]   this is drivable space, this is a car,
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.240]   this is a pedestrian or cyclist or something like that.
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:34.240]   It's outputting proper vectors to the C++ control code
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:44.800]   as opposed to the sort of constructing the vectors in C.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:52.240]   We've done, I think, quite a good job of,
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.780]   but it's, we're kind of hitting a local maximum
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.920]   on the how well the C can do this.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:02.800]   So this is really a big deal.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:04.760]   And just all of the networks in the car
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:06.720]   need to move to surround video.
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:07.960]   There's still some legacy networks
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.280]   that are not surround video.
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.880]   And all of the training needs to move to surround video
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.040]   and the efficiency of the training,
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.760]   it needs to get better and it is.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   And then we need to move everything to raw photon counts
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.480]   as opposed to processed images.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.440]   Which is quite a big reset on the training
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.240]   'cause the system's trained on post-processed images.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:36.960]   So we need to redo all the training
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:41.960]   to train against the raw photon counts
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   instead of the post-processed image.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.440]   - So ultimately it's kind of reducing the complexity
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.280]   of the whole thing.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.360]   So reducing-- - Yeah.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   - Reducing-- - Lines of code
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.960]   will actually go lower.
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.320]   - Yeah, that's fascinating.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.240]   So you're doing fusion of all the sensors,
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.840]   reducing the complexity of having to deal with--
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:58.680]   - Fusion of the cameras.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:00.200]   There's a lot of cameras really.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:01.040]   - Right, yes.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.920]   Same with humans.
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.520]   I guess we got ears too, okay.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.240]   - Yeah, well actually you need to incorporate sound as well
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.600]   'cause you need to listen for ambulance sirens
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:19.600]   or fire trucks, if somebody like yelling at you
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.120]   or something, I don't know.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.040]   There's a little bit of audio
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.800]   that needs to be incorporated as well.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.280]   - Do you need to go back to break?
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.600]   - Yeah, sure, let's take a break.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.960]   - Okay.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.520]   - Honestly, frankly, the ideas are the easy thing
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.080]   and the implementation is the hard thing.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.760]   Like the idea of going to the moon is the easy part.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.160]   Not going to the moon is the hard part.
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.400]   - It's the hard part.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.720]   - And there's a lot of hardcore engineering
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.880]   that's gotta get done at the hardware and software level,
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.960]   like I said, optimizing the C compiler
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.960]   and just cutting out latency everywhere.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:35:00.040]   If we don't do this, the system will not work properly.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:03.040]   So the work of the engineers doing this,
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.560]   they are like the unsung heroes,
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:09.080]   but they are critical to the success of the situation.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.120]   - I think you made it clear.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.640]   I mean, at least to me, it's super exciting,
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.360]   everything that's going on outside of what Andre's doing.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.880]   Just the whole infrastructure of the software.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.040]   I mean, everything that's going on with Data Engine,
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.760]   whatever it's called, the whole process is just work of art.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.800]   - The sheer scale of it boggles the mind.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:29.160]   Like the training, the amount of work done with,
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.680]   like we've written all this custom software
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:34.960]   for training and labeling and to do auto-labeling.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.320]   Auto-labeling is essential.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:41.200]   'Cause especially when you've got surround video,
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.160]   it's very difficult to label surround video from scratch.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.400]   It's extremely difficult.
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:50.320]   It would take a human such a long time
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.880]   to even label one video clip, like several hours.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.400]   Or the auto-labeler, basically we just apply
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   like heavy duty, like a lot of compute to the video clips
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:07.400]   to pre-assign and guess what all the things are
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.960]   that are going on in the surround video.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.360]   - And then there's like correcting it.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.920]   - Yeah, and then all the human has to do is like tweet,
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:15.960]   like say, adjust what is incorrect.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.960]   This is like increases productivity by a hundred or more.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.440]   - Yeah, so you've presented TeslaBot
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.160]   as primarily useful in the factory.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.320]   First of all, I think humanoid robots are incredible.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.360]   From a fan of robotics, I think the elegance of movement
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:36.960]   that humanoid robots, that bipedal robots show
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.000]   are just so cool.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.760]   So it's really interesting that you're working on this
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.240]   and also talking about applying the same kind of,
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.440]   all the ideas of some of which we've talked about
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.920]   with data engine, all the things that we're talking about
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.400]   with Tesla autopilot, just transferring that over
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:54.560]   to the just yet another robotics problem.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.840]   I have to ask, since I care about human-robot interactions,
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.200]   so the human side of that,
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.600]   so you've talked about mostly in the factory.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.040]   Do you see part of this problem that TeslaBot has to solve
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.840]   is interacting with humans and potentially having a place
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.520]   like in the home?
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.320]   So interacting, not just not replacing labor,
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:17.160]   but also like, I don't know, being a friend
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.000]   or an assistant or something like that.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.440]   - Yeah, yeah, I think the possibilities are endless.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:29.760]   Yeah, I mean, it's obviously,
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.680]   it's not quite in Tesla's primary mission direction
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.440]   of accelerating sustainable energy,
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.800]   but it is an extremely useful thing
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.840]   that we can do for the world,
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.920]   which is to make a useful humanoid robot
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.720]   that is capable of interacting with the world
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:49.080]   and helping in many different ways.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:53.800]   So in fact, reason, and really just,
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.480]   I mean, I think if you say like extrapolate
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.280]   to many years in the future,
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:04.080]   it's like, I think work will become optional.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:09.480]   So like there's a lot of jobs that if people
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.000]   weren't paid to do it, they wouldn't do it.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.280]   Like it's not fun, necessarily.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.480]   Like if you're washing dishes all day,
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.720]   it's like, eh, even if you really like washing dishes,
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.120]   you really wanna do it for eight hours a day every day.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:22.960]   Probably not.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.320]   And then there's like dangerous work.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.320]   And basically if it's dangerous, boring,
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.000]   has like potential for repetitive stress injury,
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.600]   that kind of thing, then that's really where
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.860]   humanoid robots would add the most value initially.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:44.460]   So that's what we're aiming for is to,
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.840]   for the humanoid robots to do jobs
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.160]   that people don't voluntarily want to do.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:53.480]   And then we'll have to pair that obviously
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.160]   with some kind of universal basic income in the future.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.220]   So I think.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.920]   - So do you see a world when there's like hundreds
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.480]   of millions of Tesla bots doing different,
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:09.920]   performing different tasks throughout the world?
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.400]   - Yeah, I haven't really thought about it
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.240]   that far into the future,
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.740]   but I guess that there may be something like that.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:21.720]   - Can I ask a wild question?
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:25.520]   So the number of Tesla cars has been accelerating,
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.260]   has been close to 2 million produced.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.320]   Many of them have autopilot.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.400]   - I think we're over 2 million now, yeah.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.800]   - Do you think there will ever be a time
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.280]   when there'll be more Tesla bots than Tesla cars?
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.460]   (silence)
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:44.240]   - Yeah, actually it's funny you asked this question
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.720]   because normally I do try to think pretty far
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:47.800]   into the future, but I haven't really thought
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:52.600]   that far into the future with the Tesla bot
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.920]   or it's codenamed Optimus.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.940]   I call it Optimus Subprime.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:59.320]   (laughs)
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.800]   Because it's not like a giant transformer robot.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.400]   So, but it's meant to be a general purpose, helpful bot.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:17.080]   And basically, like the things that we're,
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:20.640]   basically, like Tesla, I think,
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.240]   has the most advanced real-world AI
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.400]   for interacting with the real world,
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.160]   which we've developed as a function
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.600]   to make self-driving work.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.520]   And so, along with custom hardware
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.040]   and like a lot of hardcore low-level software
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.240]   to have it run efficiently and be power efficient,
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.480]   because it's one thing to do neural nets
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.800]   if you've got a gigantic server room with 10,000 computers,
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:48.680]   but now let's say you have to now distill that down
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:51.120]   into one computer that's running at low power
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.520]   in a humanoid robot or a car.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:54.480]   That's actually very difficult.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:57.040]   A lot of hardcore software work is required for that.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:02.840]   So, since we're kind of like solving the,
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:07.840]   navigate the real world with neural nets problem for cars,
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.080]   which are kind of like robots with four wheels,
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.480]   then it's like kind of a natural extension of that
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.480]   is to put it in a robot with arms and legs and actuators.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:25.400]   So, like the two hard things are,
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:31.480]   like you basically need to make the,
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.120]   have the robot be intelligent enough
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.680]   to interact in a sensible way with the environment.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.800]   So, you just need real world AI
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:43.560]   and you need to be very good at manufacturing,
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.880]   which is a very hard problem.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.720]   Tesla's very good at manufacturing
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:49.400]   and also has the real world AI.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.200]   So, making the humanoid robot work is,
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:58.440]   basically means developing custom motors and sensors
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.000]   that are different from what a car would use.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.920]   But we've also, we have,
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.320]   I think we have the best expertise
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:15.200]   in developing advanced electric motors and power electronics.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.600]   So, it just has to be for a humanoid robot application
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.440]   not a car.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:25.720]   - Still, you do talk about love sometimes.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:28.600]   So, let me ask, this isn't like for like sex robots
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.720]   or something like that. - Love is the answer.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.560]   Yes.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:35.640]   There is something compelling to us,
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.520]   not compelling, but we connect with humanoid robots
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.480]   or even legged robots, like with a dog
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:43.160]   in shapes of dogs.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:45.360]   It just, it seems like, you know,
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.200]   there's a huge amount of loneliness in this world.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.840]   All of us seek companionship with other humans,
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:52.720]   friendship and all those kinds of things.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:55.960]   We have a lot of here in Austin, a lot of people have dogs.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.800]   - Sure.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.480]   - There seems to be a huge opportunity
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.160]   to also have robots that decrease
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:06.200]   the amount of loneliness in the world
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.720]   or help us humans connect with each other.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.560]   So, in a way that dogs can.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.720]   Do you think about that, would test about it all
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.920]   or is it really focused on the problem
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:21.120]   of performing specific tasks, not connecting with humans?
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:26.000]   - I mean, to be honest, I have not actually thought about it
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.760]   from the companionship standpoint,
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:30.160]   but I think it actually would end up being,
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.320]   it could be actually a very good companion.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:39.040]   And it could, you develop like a personality
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:44.040]   over time that is like unique.
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.880]   Like, you know, it's not like they're just,
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.400]   all the robots are the same.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.920]   And that personality could evolve to be, you know,
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:58.400]   match the owner or the, you know, I guess, the owner.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.560]   - Well--
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.240]   - Whatever you wanna call it.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.200]   - The other half, right?
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.560]   In the same way that friends do.
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:08.840]   See, I think that's a huge opportunity.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:09.680]   I think--
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.080]   - Yeah, no, that's interesting.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:17.480]   'Cause, you know, like there's a Japanese phrase,
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:22.080]   I like the, wabi-sabi, you know, the subtle imperfections
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.080]   are what makes something special.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.880]   And the subtle imperfections of the personality of the robot
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:29.680]   mapped to the subtle imperfections
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.680]   of the robot's human friend, I don't know,
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.480]   owner sounds like maybe the wrong word,
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:41.480]   but could actually make an incredible buddy, basically.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.640]   - And in that way, the imperfections--
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:46.440]   - Like R2D2 or like a C3PO sort of thing, you know?
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.640]   - So from a machine learning perspective,
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:54.000]   I think the flaws being a feature is really nice.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.160]   You could be quite terrible at being a robot
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.920]   for quite a while in the general home environment
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.720]   or in the general world, and that's kind of adorable.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.720]   And that's like, those are your flaws,
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.720]   and you fall in love with those flaws.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.880]   So it's very different than autonomous driving,
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.600]   where it's a very high stakes environment
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.200]   you cannot mess up.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:17.800]   And so it's more fun to be a robot in the home.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.640]   - Yeah, in fact, if you think of like a C3PO
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.440]   and R2D2, they actually had a lot of flaws
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.280]   and imperfections and silly things,
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.120]   and they would argue with each other.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:31.240]   - Were they actually good at doing anything?
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:33.960]   I'm not exactly sure.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.400]   - I think they definitely added a lot to the story.
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:40.600]   But there's sort of quirky elements
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.480]   that they would make mistakes and do things.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.720]   It was like it made them relatable, I don't know,
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.680]   enduring.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.440]   So yeah, I think that that could be something
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.320]   that probably would happen.
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.920]   But our initial focus is just to make it useful.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.760]   I'm confident we'll get it done.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.200]   I'm not sure what the exact timeframe is,
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.240]   but we'll probably have, I don't know,
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.720]   a decent prototype towards the end of next year
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:14.880]   or something like that.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:18.840]   - And it's cool that it's connected to Tesla, the car.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.640]   - Yeah, it's using a lot of,
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.240]   it would use the autopilot inference computer,
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:29.280]   and a lot of the training that we've done for cars
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.240]   in terms of recognizing real-world things
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:35.800]   could be applied directly to the robot.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.760]   But there's a lot of custom actuators and sensors
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.480]   that need to be developed.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.440]   - And an extra module on top of the vector space for love.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.200]   That's me saying.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.440]   Okay.
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.280]   - We can add that to the car too.
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.120]   - That's true.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:57.440]   That could be useful in all environments.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.320]   Like you said, a lot of people argue in the car,
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.840]   so maybe we can help them out.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.560]   You're a student of history,
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:06.120]   fan of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:06.960]   - Yeah, it's great.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.520]   - Greatest podcast ever.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.300]   - Yeah, I think it is, actually.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.800]   It almost doesn't really count as a podcast.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.760]   - Yeah, it's more like an audio book.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.760]   - So you were on the podcast with Dan,
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.120]   just had a chat with him about it.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:23.560]   He said you guys went military and all that kind of stuff.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.140]   - Yeah, it was basically,
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:31.840]   it should be titled Engineer Wars.
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.240]   Essentially, when there's a rapid change
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.640]   in the rate of technology,
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.400]   then engineering plays a pivotal role in victory and battle.
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.480]   - How far back in history did you go?
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.280]   Did you go World War II?
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:50.760]   - It was mostly, well, it was supposed to be a deep dive
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:55.360]   on fighters and bomber technology in World War II,
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.600]   but that ended up being more wide ranging than that.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.400]   'Cause I just went down the total rat hole
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.760]   of studying all of the fighters and bombers in World War II
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:07.320]   and the constant rock, paper, scissors game
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:11.000]   that one country would make this plane,
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.240]   and then it'd make a plane to beat that,
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.840]   and that country would make a plane to beat that,
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.520]   and then they'd do it.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:18.560]   And really what matters is the pace of innovation
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.560]   and also access to high quality fuel and raw materials.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.720]   So Germany had some amazing designs,
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.120]   but they couldn't make them
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:31.520]   because they couldn't get the raw materials.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.520]   And they had a real problem with the oil and fuel, basically.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:39.960]   The fuel quality was extremely variable.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:42.360]   - So the design wasn't the bottleneck?
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.240]   - Yeah, the US had kick-ass fuel that was very consistent.
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:48.840]   The problem is if you make a very high performance
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.520]   aircraft engine, in order to make high performance,
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:56.520]   you have to, the fuel, the aviation gas,
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:01.440]   has to be a consistent mixture
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.360]   and it has to have a high octane.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.960]   High octane is the most important thing,
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.680]   but also can't have impurities and stuff
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.080]   'cause you'll foul up the engine.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.280]   And Germany just never had good access to oil.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:19.080]   Like they tried to get it by invading the Caucasus,
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.580]   but that didn't work too well.
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:21.840]   (laughing)
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:22.680]   - Never works well.
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.280]   - Didn't work out for them.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:25.120]   - See you, Jerry.
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:26.520]   See you, Jerry.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.560]   - Nice to meet you.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.000]   So Germany was always struggling with basically shitty oil.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000]   And so then they couldn't count on high quality fuel
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.160]   for their aircraft, so then they had to have
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.080]   all these additives and stuff.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:45.520]   Whereas the US had awesome fuel
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.280]   and they provided that to Britain as well.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.160]   So that allowed the British and the Americans
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.000]   to design aircraft engines that were super high performance,
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.840]   better than anything else in the world.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.920]   Germany could design the engines,
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:01.040]   they just didn't have the fuel.
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:05.800]   And then also the quality of the aluminum alloys
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:07.400]   that they were getting was also not that great.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.280]   And so, you know.
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.560]   - Is this like, you talked about all this with Dan?
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:12.400]   - Yep.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:13.640]   - Awesome.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.760]   Broadly looking at history, when you look at Genghis Khan,
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:19.360]   when you look at Stalin, Hitler,
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.260]   the darkest moments of human history,
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:23.920]   what do you take away from those moments?
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:26.000]   Does it help you gain insight about human nature,
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.480]   about human behavior today?
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:30.520]   Whether it's the wars or the individuals
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:33.560]   or just the behavior of people, any aspects of history?
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.060]   (computer mouse clicking)
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:43.020]   - Yeah, I find history fascinating.
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:51.320]   I mean, there's just a lot of incredible things
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:52.960]   that have been done, good and bad,
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:59.120]   that they help you understand the nature of civilization.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.080]   And individuals and--
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:07.480]   - Does it make you sad that humans
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:09.560]   do these kinds of things to each other?
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.360]   You look at the 20th century, World War II,
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:15.720]   the cruelty, the abuse of power.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.360]   Talk about communism, Marxism, Stalin.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:21.640]   - I mean, some of these things do,
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:25.320]   I mean, if you, like there's a lot of human history.
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.560]   Most of it is actually people just getting on
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.800]   with their lives, you know?
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.720]   And it's not like human history is just
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.280]   nonstop war and disaster.
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:38.920]   Those are actually just, those are intermittent and rare.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.260]   And if they weren't, then humans would soon cease to exist.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:50.080]   But it's just that wars tend to be written about a lot,
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.200]   and whereas like, something being like,
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:56.960]   well, a normal year where nothing major happened
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.480]   was just get written about much.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:01.160]   But that's, you know, most people just like farming
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:03.720]   and kind of like living their life, you know?
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:06.580]   Being a villager somewhere.
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:11.200]   And every now and again, there's a war.
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:12.040]   So.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:18.200]   And yeah, what I would say, like,
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.520]   there aren't very many books that I,
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.960]   where I just had to stop reading
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:25.920]   'cause it was just too dark.
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:29.840]   But the book about Stalin, "The Court of the Red Czar,"
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.200]   I had to stop reading.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:37.200]   It was just too dark, rough.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.120]   - Yeah.
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:44.280]   The '30s, there's a lot of lessons there to me,
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.360]   in particular that it feels like humans,
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:51.620]   like all of us have that, it's the old Solzhenitsyn line,
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:54.720]   that the line between good and evil
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:56.160]   runs through the heart of every man,
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.880]   that all of us are capable of evil,
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.340]   all of us are capable of good.
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:01.200]   It's almost like this kind of responsibility
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:06.200]   that all of us have to tend towards the good.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.400]   And so, like, to me, looking at history
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.420]   is almost like an example of,
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:14.080]   look, you have some charismatic leader
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.560]   that convinces you of things.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:19.400]   It's too easy, based on that story,
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:23.400]   to do evil onto each other, onto your family, onto others.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.760]   And so it's like our responsibility to do good.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.700]   It's not like now is somehow different from history.
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:32.820]   That can happen again, all of it can happen again.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:34.980]   And yes, most of the time, you're right.
[01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:37.180]   I mean, the optimistic view here is
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:38.900]   mostly people are just living life.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:42.100]   And as you've often memed about,
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.980]   the quality of life was way worse back in the day,
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:46.940]   and it keeps improving over time
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.800]   through innovation, through technology.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.300]   But still, it's somehow notable
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:54.380]   that these blimps of atrocities happen.
[01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:55.220]   - Sure.
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:58.740]   Yeah, I mean, life was really tough
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:02.020]   for most of history.
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.220]   I mean, really for most of human history,
[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:07.820]   a good year would be one where
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:10.380]   not that many people in your village
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:13.620]   died of the plague, starvation, freezing to death,
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:15.620]   or being killed by a neighboring village.
[01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:17.860]   It's like, well, it wasn't that bad.
[01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:19.020]   You know, it was only like, you know,
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:20.140]   we lost 5% this year.
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:23.340]   That was a good year.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.220]   That would be par for the course.
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:27.680]   Just not starving to death would have been
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:31.160]   the primary goal of most people throughout history,
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:32.840]   is making sure we'll have enough food
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:35.840]   to last through the winter and not freeze or whatever.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:36.680]   So,
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:42.280]   now food is plentiful.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.560]   I have an obesity problem.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.640]   - Well, yeah, the lesson there is to be grateful
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.540]   for the way things are now for some of us.
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:54.940]   We've spoken about this offline.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.480]   I'd love to get your thought about it here.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:03.740]   If I sat down for a long-form in-person conversation
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:06.960]   with the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin,
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:09.880]   would you potentially want to call in for a few minutes
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:12.600]   to join in on a conversation with him,
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:14.360]   moderated and translated by me?
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:17.400]   - Sure, yeah, sure, I'd be happy to do that.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:22.040]   - You've shown interest in the Russian language.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.520]   Is this grounded in your interest
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:27.780]   in history of linguistics, culture, general curiosity?
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:29.660]   - I think it sounds cool.
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:31.300]   - Sounds cool, not looks cool.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:37.580]   - Well, it takes a moment to read Cyrillic.
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:43.140]   Once you know what the Cyrillic characters stand for,
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:47.100]   actually, then reading Russian becomes a lot easier
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:49.340]   'cause there are a lot of words that are actually the same.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:50.420]   Like bank is bank.
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:52.840]   (laughing)
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:57.740]   - So find the words that are exactly the same
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:55:59.700]   and now you start to understand Cyrillic, yeah.
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:01.700]   - If you can sound it out,
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:06.600]   there's at least some commonality of words.
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.920]   - What about the culture?
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:12.100]   You love great engineering, physics.
[01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:14.780]   There's a tradition of the sciences there.
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:16.880]   You look at the 20th century from rocketry,
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:19.340]   so some of the greatest rockets,
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:21.740]   some of the space exploration has been done
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:24.140]   in the Soviet and the former Soviet Union.
[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:27.700]   So do you draw inspiration from that history?
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:30.540]   Just how this culture that in many ways,
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:33.200]   I mean, one of the sad things is because of the language,
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.380]   a lot of it is lost to history
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:37.480]   because it's not translated, all those kinds of,
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:40.900]   because it is in some ways an isolated culture.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:43.380]   It flourishes within its borders.
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.780]   So do you draw inspiration from those folks,
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:51.500]   from the history of science and engineering there?
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:56.500]   - I mean, the Soviet Union, Russia, and Ukraine as well,
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:01.780]   and have a really strong history in space flight.
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:04.580]   Like some of the most advanced and impressive things
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:09.580]   in history were done by the Soviet Union.
[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:16.260]   So one cannot help but admire the history
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:18.380]   and one cannot help but admire the impressive
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:20.220]   rocket technology that was developed.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:24.220]   After the fall of the Soviet Union,
[01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:29.040]   there's much less that happened.
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:34.380]   But still things are happening,
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:38.060]   but it's not quite at the frenetic pace
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:41.940]   that it was happening before the Soviet Union
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.860]   kind of dissolved into separate republics.
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:51.420]   - Yeah, I mean, there's Roscosmos, the Russian agency.
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:55.780]   I look forward to a time when those countries
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:58.020]   with China are working together.
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:00.020]   The United States are all working together.
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:01.900]   Maybe a little bit of friendly competition, but--
[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.800]   - I think friendly competition is good.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.300]   You know, governments are slow,
[01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:07.860]   and the only thing slower than one government
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:09.460]   is a collection of governments.
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:14.140]   So the Olympics would be boring
[01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:15.780]   if everyone just crossed the finishing line
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:17.060]   at the same time.
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:18.060]   Nobody would watch.
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:22.380]   And people wouldn't try hard to run fast and stuff.
[01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:24.780]   So I think friendly competition is a good thing.
[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:28.120]   - This is also a good place to give a shout out
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.780]   to a video titled "The Entire Soviet Rocket Engine
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:34.300]   Family Tree" by Tim Dodd, aka Everyday Astronaut.
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:35.420]   It's like an hour and a half.
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:38.620]   It gives a full history of Soviet rockets.
[01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:40.260]   And people should definitely go check out
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:41.500]   and support Tim in general.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:43.900]   That guy is super excited about the future,
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:45.940]   super excited about space flight.
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:47.180]   Every time I see anything by him,
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:48.980]   I just have a stupid smile on my face
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:51.220]   'cause he's so excited about stuff.
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:52.060]   - Yeah. - I love people like that.
[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:53.940]   - Tim Dodd is really great.
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:56.220]   If you're interested in anything to do with space,
[01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:59.980]   he's, in terms of explaining rocket technology
[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:02.220]   to your average person, he's awesome.
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:03.220]   The best, I'd say.
[01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:08.380]   And I should say, like, the part of the reason
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:12.180]   like I switched us from, like,
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:14.740]   Grafter at one point was gonna be a hydrogen engine.
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:17.460]   But hydrogen has a lot of challenges.
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:18.500]   It's very low density.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.500]   It's a deep cryogen, so it's only liquid
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:23.380]   at a very close to absolute zero.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:24.980]   Requires a lot of insulation.
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:28.880]   So there's a lot of challenges there.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:32.940]   And I was actually reading a bit
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:35.780]   about Russian rocket engine development.
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:38.980]   And at least the impression I had was that,
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:43.700]   or Soviet Union, Russia, and Ukraine, primarily,
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:48.700]   were actually in the process of switching to Methylox.
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:55.500]   And there was some interesting test and data for ISP.
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:57.300]   Like, they were able to get, like,
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:01.340]   up to like a 380 second ISP with a Methylox engine.
[02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:02.180]   And I was like, whoa, okay,
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:05.420]   that's actually really impressive.
[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:10.420]   So I think you could actually get a much lower cost,
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:16.040]   like, in optimizing cost per ton to orbit,
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.140]   cost per ton to Mars.
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:20.680]   It's, I think,
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:24.340]   methane oxygen is the way to go.
[02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:27.900]   And I was partly inspired by the Russian work
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:31.480]   on the test stands with Methylox engines.
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:35.180]   - And now for something completely different.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:38.340]   Do you mind doing a bit of a meme review
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:41.740]   in the spirit of the great, the powerful PewDiePie?
[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:42.860]   Let's say one to 11,
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:45.660]   just go over a few documents printed out.
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:46.760]   - We can try.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.600]   - Let's try this.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:52.620]   I present to you document numero uno.
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:58.740]   - I don't know, okay.
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:02.400]   - Vlad the Impaler discovers marshmallows.
[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:05.220]   - Yeah, that's not bad.
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:11.660]   - So you get it because he likes impaling things?
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.500]   - Yes, I get it.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.700]   I don't know, three, whatever.
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.860]   - That's not very good.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:23.420]   This is ground in some engineering, some history.
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:31.300]   - Yeah, I give this an eight out of 10.
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:33.180]   - What do you think about nuclear power?
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:34.900]   - I'm in favor of nuclear power.
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:35.740]   I think it's,
[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:41.780]   in a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters,
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:46.460]   I think nuclear power is a great way to generate electricity.
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:49.580]   I don't think we should be shutting down
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:50.740]   nuclear power stations.
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:53.540]   - Yeah, but what about Chernobyl?
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:54.380]   - Exactly.
[02:01:54.380 --> 02:01:59.900]   So I think people,
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.620]   there's a lot of fear of radiation and stuff.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:07.780]   And I guess the problem is a lot of people just don't,
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:12.140]   they didn't study engineering or physics,
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:13.540]   so they don't,
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:15.820]   just the word radiation just sounds scary.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:19.120]   So they can't calibrate what radiation means.
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:25.140]   But radiation is much less dangerous than you'd think.
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.700]   So,
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:32.180]   like for example, Fukushima,
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:36.540]   when the Fukushima problem happened,
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:39.820]   due to the tsunami,
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:43.620]   I got people in California asking me
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:46.420]   if they should worry about radiation from Fukushima.
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:48.660]   And I'm like, definitely not,
[02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:51.520]   not even slightly, not at all.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.440]   That is crazy.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:56.380]   And just to
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:00.380]   show, like, look, this is how,
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:04.140]   like the dangers is so much overplayed
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:06.380]   compared to what it really is,
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:09.020]   that I actually flew to Fukushima.
[02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:13.740]   And I actually, I donated a solar power system
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:15.300]   for a water treatment plant.
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:20.300]   And I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:25.940]   on TV in Fukushima.
[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:28.700]   (silence)
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:31.500]   Like, I'm still alive, okay.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:34.100]   - So it's not even that the risk of these events is low,
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:36.060]   but the impact of them is--
[02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:38.420]   - Impact is greatly exaggerated.
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:40.060]   It's just great. - It's human nature.
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:41.900]   - It's people, people don't know what radiation is.
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:42.980]   Like I've had people ask me, like,
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:44.980]   what about radiation from cell phones,
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.240]   causing brain cancer?
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.700]   I'm like, when you say radiation,
[02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:49.620]   do you mean photons or particles?
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:51.140]   Then like, then I don't know what,
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.220]   what do you mean photons, particles?
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:53.060]   So do you mean,
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:59.380]   let's say photons, what frequency or wavelength?
[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:01.820]   And they're like, no, I have no idea.
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:04.780]   Like, do you know that everything's radiating all the time?
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:06.020]   Like, what do you mean?
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:08.700]   Like, yeah, everything's radiating all the time.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:11.500]   Photons are being emitted by all objects
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:12.420]   all the time, basically.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:17.420]   So, and if you wanna know what it means
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:21.660]   to stand in front of nuclear fire, go outside.
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:26.660]   The sun is a gigantic thermonuclear reactor
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.580]   that you're staring right at it.
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:29.620]   - Yeah. - Are you still alive?
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:32.540]   Yes, okay, amazing. (laughs)
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:34.460]   - Yeah, I guess radiation is one of the words
[02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:38.660]   that can be used as a tool to fear monger
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.260]   by certain people, that's it.
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:42.420]   - I think people just don't understand, so.
[02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:44.820]   - I mean, that's the way to fight that fear, I suppose,
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:46.660]   is to understand, is to learn.
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:48.260]   - Yeah, just say like, okay, how many people
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:50.340]   have actually died from nuclear accidents?
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:51.620]   Like, practically nothing.
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:56.620]   And say how many people have died from coal plants,
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:59.380]   and it's a very big number.
[02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:04.180]   So, like, obviously we should not be starting up coal plants
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:05.300]   and shutting down nuclear plants.
[02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:07.480]   Just doesn't make any sense at all.
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:09.460]   Coal plants, like, I don't know,
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:12.740]   100 to 1,000 times worse for health
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:14.060]   than nuclear power plants.
[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:16.340]   - You wanna go to the next one?
[02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:17.860]   It's really bad.
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:20.180]   (Richard laughs)
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:24.340]   - It's that 90, 180, and 360 degrees,
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:28.020]   everybody loves the math, nobody gives a shit about 270.
[02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:30.060]   - It's not super funny.
[02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:31.340]   I don't like 203.
[02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:35.840]   This is not, you know, LOL situation.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.460]   (both laugh)
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:38.300]   - Yeah.
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:43.460]   (both laugh)
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:44.300]   - That was pretty good.
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:46.780]   - The United States oscillating between establishing
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:48.540]   and destroying dictatorships.
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:49.940]   It's like a, is that a metric?
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:51.540]   - Yeah, metronome.
[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.260]   Yeah, it's a seven out of 10, it's kinda true.
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:57.660]   - Oh yeah, this is kinda personal for me.
[02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:58.500]   Next one.
[02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:00.500]   - Oh man, this is Laika?
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:02.020]   - Yeah, well, no, this is--
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:03.900]   - Or it's like referring to Laika or something?
[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.980]   - As Laika's, like, husband.
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:08.140]   - Husband, yeah, yeah.
[02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:09.460]   - Hello, yes, this is dog.
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:11.500]   Your wife was launched into space.
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:14.780]   And then the last one is him with his eyes closed
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:16.540]   and a bottle of vodka.
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:17.940]   - Yeah, Laika didn't come back.
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:19.140]   - No.
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:21.260]   - They don't tell you the full story of, you know,
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:25.100]   what the impact they had on the loved ones.
[02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:25.940]   - True.
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:26.860]   - That one gets an 11 from me.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:28.300]   - Sure, what's your one?
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:31.680]   - Oh yeah, this keeps going on the Russian theme.
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:36.860]   First man in space, nobody cares, first man on the moon.
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:37.940]   - Well, I think people do care.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:38.940]   - No, I know, but--
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:45.620]   - Yuri Gagarin's names will be forever in history, I think.
[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:48.000]   - There is something special about placing,
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.820]   like, stepping foot onto another totally foreign land.
[02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:56.900]   It's not the journey, like, people that explore the oceans.
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:58.580]   It's not as important to explore the oceans
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:01.100]   as to land on a whole new continent.
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.940]   - Yeah.
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:05.300]   - Well, this is about you.
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:06.260]   (laughing)
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:08.100]   Oh yeah, I'd love to get your comment on this.
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:12.300]   Elon Musk, after sending $6.6 billion to the UN
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:15.260]   to end world hunger, you have three hours.
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:19.420]   - Yeah, well, I mean, obviously $6 billion
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:21.120]   is not gonna end world hunger, so.
[02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:26.920]   So, I mean, the reality is, at this point,
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:29.980]   the world is producing far more food
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.860]   than it can really consume.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:35.840]   Like, we don't have a caloric constraint at this point.
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:39.520]   So, where there is hunger, it is almost always due to,
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:43.580]   it's like Civil War or strife or some, like,
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:47.360]   it's not a thing that is,
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:52.660]   extremely rare for it to be just a matter of, like,
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:53.500]   lack of money.
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:56.180]   It's like, you know, it's like some,
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.900]   the Civil War in some country,
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:59.180]   and like one part of the country's
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:01.460]   literally trying to starve the other part of the country.
[02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:04.140]   - So, it's much more complex
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.700]   than something that money could solve.
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:09.760]   It's geopolitics, it's a lot of things.
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:11.340]   It's human nature, it's governments,
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:14.660]   it's money, monetary systems, all that kind of stuff.
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:17.660]   - Yeah, food is extremely cheap these days.
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:22.340]   I mean, the US at this point,
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:27.180]   among low-income families, obesity is actually
[02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:28.020]   another problem.
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:31.020]   It's not, like, obesity is, it's not hunger.
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:34.540]   It's like too much, you know, too many calories.
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:37.860]   So, it's not that nobody's hungry anywhere.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:42.460]   It's just, this is not a simple matter
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:43.980]   of adding money and solving it.
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:44.820]   - Hmm.
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:48.740]   What do you think that one gets?
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:50.580]   It's getting-- - I don't know.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:51.420]   Two.
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:54.020]   (laughing)
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:55.260]   - This is going after empires.
[02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:57.500]   World, where did you get those artifacts?
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:59.340]   The British Museum.
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:02.980]   Shout out to Monty Python, we found them.
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:05.860]   - Yeah, the British Museum is pretty great.
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:08.340]   I mean, admittedly, Britain did take
[02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.300]   these historical artifacts from all around the world
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:12.900]   and put them in London, but, you know,
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:16.020]   it's not like people can't go see them.
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:19.900]   So, it is a convenient place to see these ancient artifacts
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:24.900]   is London for a large segment of the world.
[02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:26.420]   So, I think, you know, on balance,
[02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:28.140]   the British Museum is a net good.
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.300]   Although, I'm sure that a lot of countries
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:31.220]   would argue about that.
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:32.700]   - Yeah.
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:34.740]   - It's like you wanna make these historical artifacts
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:37.140]   accessible to as many people as possible.
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:40.060]   And the British Museum, I think, does a good job of that.
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:42.900]   Even if there's a darker aspect
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:44.860]   to like the history of empire in general,
[02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:47.900]   whatever the empire is, however things were done,
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:52.060]   it is the history that happened.
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:54.220]   You can't sort of erase that history, unfortunately.
[02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:56.580]   You could just become better in the future.
[02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:58.340]   That's the point.
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:00.860]   - Yeah, I mean, it's like, well,
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:03.980]   how are we gonna pass moral judgment on these things?
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:08.980]   Like, it's like, you know, if one is gonna judge,
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:11.580]   say, the British Empire, you gotta judge, you know,
[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:13.500]   what everyone was doing at the time
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:15.980]   and how were the British relative to everyone.
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:20.020]   And I think the British would actually get
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:22.980]   like a relatively good grade, relatively good grade,
[02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:24.180]   not in absolute terms,
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:27.620]   but compared to what everyone else was doing,
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:31.500]   they were not the worst.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:32.740]   Like I said, you gotta look at these things
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:35.300]   in the context of the history at the time
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:37.100]   and say, what were the alternatives
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:38.540]   and what are you comparing it against?
[02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:39.380]   - Yes.
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:41.820]   I do not think it would be the case
[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:46.820]   that Britain would get a bad grade
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:48.980]   when looking at history at the time.
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:53.340]   Now, if you judge history from, you know,
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:56.060]   from what is morally acceptable today,
[02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:58.860]   you're basically gonna give everyone a failing grade.
[02:10:58.860 --> 02:10:59.860]   I'm not clear.
[02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:02.380]   I don't think anyone would get a passing grade
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:06.380]   in their morality of like, you go back 300 years ago,
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:08.660]   like who's getting a passing grade?
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:09.580]   Basically no one.
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:13.060]   - And we might not get a passing grade
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:15.780]   from generations that come after us.
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:18.460]   What does that one get?
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:22.420]   - Sure, six, seven.
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:24.180]   - For the Monty Python, maybe.
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:26.820]   - I always love Monty Python, they're great.
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:28.380]   The Life of Brian and the Quest of the Holy Grail
[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.300]   are incredible.
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:30.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:32.580]   - Damn, those serious eyebrows.
[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:33.420]   - Brashen up.
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:35.940]   How important do you think is facial hair
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:38.300]   to great leadership?
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:39.740]   You got a new haircut.
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:42.860]   Is that, how does that affect your leadership?
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:45.780]   - I don't know, hopefully not.
[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:46.620]   It doesn't.
[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:48.460]   - Is that the second no one?
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:49.900]   - Yeah, the second is no one.
[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:52.860]   - There is no one competing with Brashen.
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:53.740]   - No one two.
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:55.260]   - Those are like epic eyebrows.
[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:58.500]   So, sure.
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:00.380]   - That's ridiculous.
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:02.220]   - Give it a six or seven, I don't know.
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:05.700]   - I like this, like Shakespearean analysis of memes.
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:08.420]   - Brashen, he had a flair for drama as well.
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:11.380]   Like, you know, showmanship.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:14.180]   - Yeah, yeah, it must come from the eyebrows.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:18.140]   All right, invention, great engineering.
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:19.740]   Look what I invented.
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:22.060]   That's the best thing since ripped up bread.
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:22.900]   - Yeah.
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:25.860]   - 'Cause they invented sliced bread.
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:27.900]   Am I just explaining memes at this point?
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:31.580]   This is what my life has become.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:35.340]   - He's a meme lord, he's a meme explainer.
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:39.700]   - Yeah, I'm a meme, like a scribe
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:41.460]   that runs around with the kings
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:44.260]   and just writes down memes.
[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:46.140]   - I mean, when was the cheeseburger invented?
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:47.540]   That's like an epic invention.
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:48.380]   - Yeah.
[02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:49.820]   - Like, wow.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:53.300]   - Versus just like a burger?
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:55.500]   - Or a burger, I guess a burger in general.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:58.780]   - Then there's like, what is a burger?
[02:12:58.780 --> 02:12:59.900]   What's a sandwich?
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:01.900]   And then you start getting, is it a pizza sandwich?
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.460]   And what is the original?
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:05.980]   It gets into an ontology argument.
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:08.020]   - Yeah, but everybody knows if you order a burger
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:08.860]   or a cheeseburger or whatever,
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:11.460]   and you get tomato and some lettuce and onions
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:15.220]   and whatever and mayo and ketchup and mustard,
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.380]   it's like epic.
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:19.020]   - Yeah, but I'm sure they've had bread and meat separately
[02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:21.140]   for a long time, and it was kind of a burger
[02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:23.660]   on the same plate, but somebody who actually combined them
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:27.620]   into the same thing and you bite it and hold it
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:28.940]   makes it convenient.
[02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:30.260]   It's a materials problem.
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.380]   Like, your hands don't get dirty and whatever.
[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:34.540]   - Yeah, it's brilliant.
[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:39.260]   - Well--
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:41.180]   - That is not what I would have guessed.
[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:43.740]   - But everyone knows, like, if you order a cheeseburger,
[02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:44.660]   you know what you're getting.
[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:47.100]   It's not like some obtuse, like,
[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:48.740]   I wonder what I'll get, you know?
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:53.420]   Fries are, I mean, great.
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:56.020]   I mean, they're the devil, but fries are awesome.
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:14:00.260]   And yeah, pizza is incredible.
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:03.780]   - Food innovation doesn't get enough love,
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:05.780]   I guess is what we're getting at.
[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:06.620]   - It's great.
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:11.980]   - What about the Matthew McConaughey Austinite here?
[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:14.940]   President Kennedy, do you know how to put men on the moon
[02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:16.020]   yet and ask them no?
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.820]   President Kennedy, it'd be a lot cooler if you did.
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:23.100]   - Pretty much, sure, six, six or seven, I suppose.
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:27.540]   - And this is the last one.
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:29.660]   - That's funny.
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:33.620]   - Someone drew a bunch of dicks all over the walls,
[02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:35.620]   Sistine Chapel, boys' bathroom.
[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:36.980]   - Sure, I'll give it nine.
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:38.460]   It's really true.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:42.420]   - This is our highest ranking meme for today.
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:44.660]   - I mean, it's true, like, how do they get away with that?
[02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:46.540]   - Lots of nakedness.
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:49.500]   - Dick pics are, I mean, just something throughout history.
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:53.660]   As long as people can draw things, there's been a dick pic.
[02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:55.060]   - It's a staple of human history.
[02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:56.460]   - It's a staple.
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:58.420]   Consistent throughout human history.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:00.620]   - You tweeted that you aspire to comedy.
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:02.380]   You're friends with Joe Rogan.
[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:05.100]   Might you do a short stand-up comedy set
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:06.620]   at some point in the future?
[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:09.580]   Maybe open for Joe, something like that.
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:11.260]   Is that-- - Really, stand-up?
[02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:12.620]   Actual, just full-on stand-up?
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:15.020]   - Full-on stand-up, is that in there, or is that--
[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:16.620]   - I've never thought about that.
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:21.580]   - It's extremely difficult, at least that's what
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.260]   Joe says and the comedians say.
[02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:26.260]   - Huh, I wonder if I could.
[02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:29.500]   There's only one way to find out.
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.700]   - You know, I have done stand-up for friends,
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:37.700]   just impromptu, you know, I'll get on like a roof,
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:41.340]   and they do laugh, but they're our friends too.
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:44.060]   So I don't know if you've got to call, you know,
[02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:46.220]   like a room of strangers, are they gonna actually
[02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:51.220]   also find it funny, but I could try, see what happens.
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:54.060]   - I think you'd learn something either way.
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:54.900]   - Yeah.
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:59.580]   - I love both when you bomb and when you do great,
[02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:02.140]   just watching people, how they deal with it.
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:06.940]   It's so difficult, you're so fragile up there.
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:09.740]   It's just you, and you think you're gonna be funny,
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:11.300]   and when it completely falls flat,
[02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:15.380]   it's just beautiful to see people deal with that.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:17.900]   - Yeah, I might have enough material to do stand-up.
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.420]   No, I've never thought about it,
[02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:21.380]   but I might have enough material.
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.620]   I don't know, like 15 minutes or something.
[02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:28.260]   - Oh yeah, yeah, do a Netflix special.
[02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:30.220]   - A Netflix special, sure.
[02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:35.100]   - What's your favorite Rick and Morty concept?
[02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:36.700]   Just to spring that on you.
[02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:39.020]   There's a lot of sort of scientific engineering ideas
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:40.580]   explored there, there's the--
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:41.420]   - Favorite Rick and Morty.
[02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:42.860]   - There's the butter robot.
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:44.700]   - It's great, yeah, it's a great show.
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:45.540]   - You like it?
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:47.140]   - Yeah, Rick and Morty's awesome.
[02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:48.540]   - Somebody that's exactly like you
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:52.060]   from an alternate dimension showed up there, Elon Tusk.
[02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:52.900]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:53.740]   - And he's voiced.
[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:55.500]   - Yeah, Rick and Morty certainly explores
[02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:57.180]   a lot of interesting concepts.
[02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:00.820]   So like what's a favorite one, I don't know.
[02:17:00.820 --> 02:17:03.180]   The butter robot certainly is, you know,
[02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:04.620]   it's like, it's certainly possible
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.880]   to have too much sentience in a device.
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:08.900]   Like you don't wanna have your toast
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:11.960]   to be like a super genius toaster.
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:14.300]   It's gonna hate life 'cause all it could do
[02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:16.220]   is make his toast, but if, you know,
[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:17.700]   it's like you don't wanna have like super intelligence
[02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:21.220]   stuck in a very limited device.
[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:22.540]   - Do you think it's too easy
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:25.100]   if we're talking about from the engineering perspective
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:28.420]   of super intelligence, like with Marvin the robot,
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:31.620]   like is it, it seems like it might be very easy
[02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:34.100]   to engineer just a depressed robot.
[02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:37.220]   Like it's not obvious to engineer a robot
[02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:40.560]   that's going to find a fulfilling existence.
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:42.780]   Same as humans, I suppose.
[02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:46.700]   But I wonder if that's like the default.
[02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:49.540]   If you don't do a good job on building a robot,
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:50.980]   it's going to be sad a lot.
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:54.820]   - Well, we can reprogram robots
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.620]   easier than we can reprogram humans.
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:03.020]   So I guess if you let it evolve without tinkering
[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:05.300]   then it might get sad,
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:08.100]   but you can change the optimization function
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:10.240]   and have it be a cheery robot.
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:15.700]   - You, like I mentioned with SpaceX,
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.140]   you give a lot of people hope
[02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:18.260]   and a lot of people look up to you,
[02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:20.340]   millions of people look up to you.
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:23.460]   If we think about young people in high school,
[02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:27.860]   maybe in college, what advice would you give to them
[02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:31.660]   about if they want to try to do something big in this world,
[02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:33.580]   they want to really have a big positive impact,
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:36.160]   what advice would you give them about their career,
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:37.620]   maybe about life in general?
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:40.620]   - Try to be useful.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:45.260]   You do things that are useful to your fellow human beings,
[02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:46.340]   to the world.
[02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:47.900]   It's very hard to be useful.
[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:49.740]   Very hard.
[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:57.140]   You know, are you contributing more than you consume?
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:19:02.140]   You know, like can you try to have a positive net
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:05.640]   contribution to society?
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:09.220]   I think that's the thing to aim for.
[02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:11.740]   You know, not to try to be sort of a leader
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:14.740]   for the sake of being a leader or whatever.
[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:21.420]   A lot of time, the people you want as leaders
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:24.300]   are the people who don't want to be leaders.
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:29.300]   So, if you can live a useful life,
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:36.180]   that is a good life, a life worth having lived.
[02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:41.740]   You know, and like I said, I would encourage people
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:46.340]   to use the mental tools of physics
[02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:48.260]   and apply them broadly in life.
[02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:49.900]   They're the best tools.
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.220]   - When you think about education and self-education,
[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:53.820]   what do you recommend?
[02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:58.740]   So, there's the university, there's self-study,
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:03.140]   there is hands-on sort of finding a company or a place
[02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:05.460]   or a set of people that do the thing you're passionate about
[02:20:05.460 --> 02:20:07.420]   and joining them as early as possible.
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:12.180]   There's taking a road trip across Europe for a few years
[02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:13.340]   and writing some poetry.
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:16.500]   Which trajectory do you suggest
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:22.580]   in terms of learning about how you can become useful,
[02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:25.580]   as you mentioned, how you can have the most positive impact?
[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:35.900]   - Well, I'd encourage people to read a lot of books.
[02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:39.220]   Just read, like, basically try to ingest
[02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:41.000]   as much information as you can.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.880]   And try to also just develop a good general knowledge.
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:51.240]   So, you at least have, like, a rough lay of the land
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:53.080]   of the knowledge landscape.
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:57.060]   Like, try to learn a little bit about a lot of things.
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:59.800]   'Cause you might not know what you're really interested in.
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:01.040]   How would you know what you're really interested in
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:05.400]   if you at least aren't, like, doing a peripheral exploration
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:09.460]   or broadly of the knowledge landscape?
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:14.940]   And talk to people from different walks of life
[02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:18.940]   and different industries and professions and skills
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:20.340]   and occupations.
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:24.800]   Like, just try to learn as much as possible.
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:28.700]   And then search for meaning.
[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:33.100]   - Isn't the whole thing a search for meaning?
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:37.220]   - Yeah, what's the meaning of life and all, you know.
[02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:38.260]   But just generally, like I said,
[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:40.940]   I would encourage people to read broadly
[02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:42.540]   in many different subject areas.
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:48.340]   And then try to find something where there's an overlap
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:51.820]   of your talents and what you're interested in.
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:53.540]   So, people may be good at something,
[02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:56.300]   or they may have skill at a particular thing,
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:57.740]   but they don't like doing it.
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:01.900]   So, you want to try to find a thing where you're,
[02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:06.660]   that's a good combination of the things
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:09.780]   that you're inherently good at, but you also like doing.
[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:16.500]   - And reading is a super fast shortcut to figure out
[02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:20.820]   which, where are you both good at it, you like doing it,
[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:23.260]   and it will actually have positive impact.
[02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:24.900]   - Well, you gotta learn about things somehow.
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:29.900]   So, reading, a broad range, just really read it.
[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:32.780]   You know, more important when I was a kid,
[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:36.260]   I read through the encyclopedia.
[02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:38.380]   So, that was pretty helpful.
[02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:42.140]   And there were all sorts of things
[02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:44.300]   I didn't even know existed, well, a lot, so obviously.
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:45.940]   - Check as broad as it gets.
[02:22:45.940 --> 02:22:48.060]   - Encyclopedias were digestible, I think,
[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:50.900]   whatever, 40 years ago.
[02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:57.420]   So, maybe read through the condensed version
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:59.980]   of the Encyclopedia Britannica, I'd recommend that.
[02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:02.580]   You can always skip subjects
[02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:03.980]   where you read a few paragraphs
[02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:05.700]   and you know you're not interested,
[02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:07.620]   just jump to the next one.
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:11.500]   So, read the encyclopedia or skim through it.
[02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:20.020]   But I put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:23.780]   for someone who puts in an honest day's work
[02:23:23.780 --> 02:23:24.940]   to do useful things.
[02:23:24.940 --> 02:23:30.220]   And just generally to have not a zero-sum mindset,
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:35.660]   or have more of a grow the pie mindset.
[02:23:35.660 --> 02:23:41.420]   If you sort of say, when we see people,
[02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:44.140]   perhaps, including some very smart people,
[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:47.420]   kind of taking an attitude of,
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:50.980]   like doing things that seem morally questionable,
[02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:53.540]   it's often because they have, at a base,
[02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:56.560]   sort of axiomatic level, a zero-sum mindset.
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:00.100]   And they, without realizing it,
[02:24:00.100 --> 02:24:02.820]   they don't realize they have a zero-sum mindset,
[02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:05.860]   or at least they don't realize it consciously.
[02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:07.640]   And so, if you have a zero-sum mindset,
[02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:08.780]   then the only way to get ahead
[02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:10.380]   is by taking things from others.
[02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:15.180]   If it's like, if the pie is fixed,
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:17.220]   then the only way to have more pie
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:19.260]   is to take someone else's pie.
[02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:21.420]   But this is false, like obviously the pie
[02:24:21.420 --> 02:24:24.540]   has grown dramatically over time, the economic pie.
[02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:27.340]   So, in reality, you can have,
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:31.140]   I don't wanna overuse this analogy,
[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:34.040]   we can have a lot of, there's a lot of pie.
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:35.940]   (Zubin laughs)
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:37.380]   - Yeah. - Pie is not fixed.
[02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:41.740]   So, you really wanna make sure you're not operating
[02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:45.460]   without realizing it from a zero-sum mindset,
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:47.380]   where the only way to get ahead
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:48.300]   is to take things from others,
[02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:49.540]   then that's gonna result in you
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.020]   trying to take things from others, which is not good.
[02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:57.060]   It's much better to work on adding to the economic pie.
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:25:02.060]   So, creating, like I said,
[02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:06.360]   creating more than you consume, doing more than you, yeah.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:09.340]   So, that's a big deal.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:13.580]   I think there's a fair number of people in finance
[02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:17.340]   that do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:18.940]   - I mean, it's all walks of life.
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:20.100]   I've seen that.
[02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:24.500]   One of the reasons Rogan inspires me
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:26.420]   is he celebrates others a lot.
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:29.340]   This is not creating a constant competition.
[02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:31.260]   Like, there's a scarcity of resources.
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:33.220]   What happens when you celebrate others
[02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:36.420]   and you promote others, the ideas of others,
[02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:38.940]   it actually grows that pie.
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:43.940]   I mean, like the resources become less scarce,
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:46.740]   and that applies in a lot of kinds of domains.
[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:49.820]   It applies in academia, where a lot of people are very,
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:53.140]   see some funding for academic research is zero-sum.
[02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:54.060]   It is not.
[02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:55.180]   If you celebrate each other,
[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:58.020]   if you get everybody to be excited about AI,
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:00.300]   about physics, about mathematics,
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:02.340]   I think there'll be more and more funding,
[02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:03.860]   and I think everybody wins.
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:05.700]   Yeah, that applies, I think, broadly.
[02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:08.580]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:26:08.580 --> 02:26:11.600]   - So, last question about love and meaning.
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:16.260]   What is the role of love in the human condition,
[02:26:16.260 --> 02:26:18.540]   broadly and more specific to you?
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:21.720]   How has love, romantic love or otherwise,
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:24.060]   made you a better person, a better human being?
[02:26:24.980 --> 02:26:28.080]   - Better engineer?
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:31.660]   - Now you're asking really perplexing questions.
[02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:39.260]   It's hard to give a, I mean, there are many books,
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:42.060]   poems, and songs written about what is love,
[02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:45.500]   and what exactly, you know,
[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:49.800]   what is love, baby, don't hurt me.
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:52.500]   (both laughing)
[02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:54.540]   - That's one of the great ones, yes.
[02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:56.260]   You have earlier quoted Shakespeare,
[02:26:56.260 --> 02:26:57.940]   but that's really up there.
[02:26:57.940 --> 02:26:58.780]   - Yeah.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:01.420]   Love is a many-splendored thing.
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:06.420]   - I mean, there's, 'cause we've talked about
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:08.420]   so many inspiring things, like be useful in the world,
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:11.760]   sort of like solve problems, alleviate suffering,
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:15.520]   but it seems like connection between humans is a source,
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:20.340]   you know, it's a source of joy, it's a source of meaning,
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:21.980]   and that's what love is, friendship,
[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:26.620]   love, I just wonder if you think about that kind of thing,
[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:29.380]   when you talk about preserving the light
[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:31.540]   of human consciousness, and us becoming
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:34.340]   a multi-planetary species.
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:40.260]   I mean, to me at least, that means, like,
[02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:44.380]   if we're just alone and conscious and intelligent,
[02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:48.180]   it doesn't mean nearly as much as if we're with others,
[02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:51.540]   right, and there's some magic created when we're together.
[02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:56.180]   The friendship of it, and I think the highest form of it
[02:27:56.180 --> 02:27:59.340]   is love, which I think broadly is much bigger
[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.860]   than just sort of romantic, but also, yes, romantic love
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:06.100]   and family and those kinds of things.
[02:28:06.100 --> 02:28:08.580]   - Well, I mean, the reason I guess I care about
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:10.140]   us becoming a multi-planet species
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:13.140]   in a space-faring civilization is,
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:15.280]   foundationally, I love humanity.
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:20.420]   And so I wish to see it prosper,
[02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:23.580]   and do great things, and be happy,
[02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:27.380]   and if I did not love humanity,
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:29.180]   I would not care about these things.
[02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:32.980]   - So when you look at the whole of it,
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:35.020]   the human history, all the people who's ever lived,
[02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:40.020]   all the people alive now, it's pretty, we're okay.
[02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:41.740]   (laughing)
[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:45.300]   On the whole, we're a pretty interesting bunch.
[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:48.260]   - Yeah, all things considered,
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.860]   and I've read a lot of history,
[02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:52.700]   including the darkest, worst parts of it,
[02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:56.980]   and despite all that, I think on balance,
[02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:58.140]   I still love humanity.
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:29:01.860]   - You joked about it with the 42.
[02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:04.460]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:05.500]   (laughing)
[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:08.780]   Is there a non-numerical representation?
[02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:11.260]   - Yeah, well, really, I think what Douglas Adams
[02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:13.140]   was saying in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
[02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:17.980]   is that the universe is the answer,
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:21.860]   and what we really need to figure out
[02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:24.460]   are what questions to ask about the answer
[02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:25.580]   that is the universe,
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:28.620]   and that the question is really the hard part,
[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:30.500]   and if you can properly frame the question,
[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:32.740]   then the answer, relatively speaking, is easy.
[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:37.540]   So therefore, if you want to understand
[02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:40.820]   what questions to ask about the universe,
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:42.260]   you want to understand the meaning of life,
[02:29:42.260 --> 02:29:45.900]   we need to expand the scope and scale of consciousness
[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:48.820]   so that we're better able to understand
[02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:50.620]   the nature of the universe
[02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:52.460]   and understand the meaning of life.
[02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:54.540]   - And ultimately, the most important part
[02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:56.720]   would be to ask the right question.
[02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:58.540]   - Yes.
[02:29:58.540 --> 02:30:01.780]   - Thereby elevating the role of the interviewer.
[02:30:01.780 --> 02:30:03.700]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:05.980]   - As the most important human in the room.
[02:30:05.980 --> 02:30:06.820]   - Absolutely.
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:07.740]   (laughing)
[02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:10.220]   Good questions are, you know,
[02:30:10.220 --> 02:30:13.180]   it's hard to come up with good questions.
[02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:14.020]   Absolutely.
[02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:15.260]   (laughing)
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:18.140]   But yeah, it's like that is the foundation of my philosophy
[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:22.700]   is that I am curious about the nature of the universe,
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:29.620]   and obviously I will die, I don't know when I'll die,
[02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:30.960]   but I won't live forever,
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:34.620]   but I would like to know that we're on a path
[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:36.680]   to understanding the nature of the universe
[02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:37.520]   and the meaning of life
[02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:39.700]   and what questions to ask about the answer
[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:40.740]   that is the universe,
[02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:44.540]   and so if we expand the scope and scale of humanity
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:46.540]   and consciousness in general,
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:47.900]   which includes Silicon consciousness,
[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:52.900]   then that seems like a fundamentally good thing.
[02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:58.980]   - Elon, like I said, I'm deeply grateful
[02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:00.860]   that you would spend your extremely valuable time
[02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:04.260]   with me today, and also that you have given
[02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:07.280]   millions of people hope in this difficult time,
[02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:11.300]   this divisive time, in this cynical time,
[02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:13.980]   so I hope you do continue doing what you're doing.
[02:31:13.980 --> 02:31:15.420]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[02:31:15.420 --> 02:31:16.340]   - Oh, you're welcome.
[02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:18.700]   Thanks for your excellent questions.
[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:21.460]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Elon Musk.
[02:31:21.460 --> 02:31:22.700]   To support this podcast,
[02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:25.380]   please check out our sponsors in the description,

[02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.540]   from Elon Musk himself.
[02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:32.220]   When something is important enough, you do it,
[02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:34.620]   even if the odds are not in your favor.
[02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:38.740]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:41.320]   (upbeat music)
