[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   There was government-sponsored mortgage enterprises
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.300]   like the VA that already started adopting VantageScore 4.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.960]   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will phase in using VantageScore,
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.000]   so later this year.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160]   The main thing is that because the VantageScore 4.0
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.700]   has limited credit history that it can work off of,
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.700]   there's about 30 plus million people
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.240]   that might actually be able to get a credit score
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.220]   that couldn't previously.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.340]   The VantageScore 4.0,
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.640]   which is their latest version of the score,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.080]   actually takes into account trending,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.200]   which is one of the things that's been more interesting
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.620]   for people because it looks at a view over time.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.840]   With this change, lenders will be able to choose
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.080]   between getting reports from two of the three major bureaus,
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.920]   so they don't need to get all three of them,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.820]   and they can choose which model they use.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520]   It's gonna give a little bit more flexibility.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.600]   It'll be interesting to see how this evolves
