[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   Computer science has worked twice as well as biotech.
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.340]   What computer science-based venture capital is able to do is it was able to
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.900]   productize 50 prior years of basic research in computer science biotech where,
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.740]   you know, that, that sector we're productizing basically the work that NIH.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.420]   Right.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.200]   And others, you know, put into basic research and the biological sciences.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.740]   And he said, you know, that, that was, you know, about half as much money.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.180]   Um, and maybe about like half as much time.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.000]   Look, he said, the problem is there aren't other sectors that have had these
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.640]   huge investments in basic research.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.100]   And so he says, look, he says, if you want to predict the future of venture
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.180]   capital, you basically just look at where, you know, the previous 50 years
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.160]   of where research R and D, you know, basic research has happened.
