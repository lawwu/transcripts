[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   What distinguishes my life from the life of a non-Christian?
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.640]   What makes the Christian life distinct in this world?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.800]   It's one of the most important topics that we can address and we're going to today on this Monday.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.760]   Welcome back to the podcast and we're gonna get there through another question. How do I serve in God's strength?
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:32.160]   That's the question that is sparked by 1 Peter chapter 4 verses 10 to 11. It was sent to us by a listener named Jacob in
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.160]   Minneapolis. Dear Pastor John, thank you for looking at my question. 1 Peter 4 10 to 11 says, "As each has received a gift,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.480]   use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's very grace.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.160]   Whoever speaks is one who speaks oracles of God.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:57.240]   Whoever serves is one who serves by the strength that God supplies in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ."
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.840]   In my fight for faith and love and holiness, I want to glorify God.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.600]   I don't want my work to be in vain. So my question is this, what does serving by the strength of God mean?
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.640]   How do I do it and how am I to work in such a way that it is God's strength working in me?
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.320]   I think this is just about the most fundamental question you can ask about how to live the
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.680]   distinctively Christian life.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.760]   How do you live so that it is not you who live but Christ who lives in you?
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.160]   How do you exert yourself and make resolutions in such a way
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.160]   that you are not relying on your exertions and your resolutions,
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.800]   but on the supernatural work of the Spirit of God in you?
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:58.720]   The text that Jacob is focusing on, one of my favorites for ministry, is verse 11 of 1 Peter 4.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.840]   "Whoever serves, let him serve in or by the strength that God supplies."
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.440]   There's the command and he's just saying, "Please help." How do you do that? What a mystery, what a miracle that is.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680]   We serve,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.600]   but we serve by the supply of the strength of another. How, he says. And of course,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.960]   this is not the only text that presses this huge issue upon us.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.400]   Romans 8 13,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.880]   "By the Spirit put to death the deeds of the body."
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.120]   So we are to do the sin-killing,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.000]   but we are to do it by the Spirit. How?
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.560]   Philippians 2 12, "Work out your own salvation,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.000]   because it is God who works in you to will and to work for his good pleasure."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.880]   So we are to work,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.320]   but the willing and the working is God's willing and working. How? How do we experience that?
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.800]   1 Corinthians 15 10, "I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.520]   but the grace of God that was with me." So Paul did work hard,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.600]   but his effort was in some way not his.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.960]   How do you do that?
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.280]   Colossians 1 29, "I toil,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:30.600]   struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works in me." Wow.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.240]   We toil, we struggle, we expend effort and energy,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.600]   but there is a way to do it so that it's God's energy, God's doing. How?
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.800]   Okay, so there it is. It's a pervasive issue.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   It's fundamental. It's right at the heart of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.640]   I wish everybody were asking this question.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.800]   In 1984, J.I. Packer, who's going to be with the Lord now,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.440]   published his book, "Keep in Step with the Spirit."
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.720]   I really enjoyed it. I remember reading it the year it came out.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.760]   In it, on page 125,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.600]   he gives his answer to this question.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.920]   And I'm going to read you his quote, just one paragraph.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.600]   Quote, "First,
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.040]   as one who wants to do all the good you can,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.200]   you observe what tasks, opportunities, and responsibilities face you.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.920]   Second,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.640]   you pray for help in these,
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   acknowledging that without Christ, you can do nothing.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.520]   Nothing fruitful that is," John 15, 5.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.800]   Third,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.600]   you go to work with a goodwill and a high
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.160]   heart expecting to be helped as you
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.640]   asked to be. Fourth,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.520]   you thank God for help given.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   Ask pardon for your own failures and rout and request
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.240]   more help for the next task." End quote.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.640]   Well, I was 38 years old when I read that.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.440]   I had been a pastor for four years.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.680]   And what thrilled me about that answer to,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   "How do you do this, Packer?
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.760]   Tell us, how do you live this life in the strength of another?"
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.920]   What thrilled me is that he spelled out exactly
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.560]   what I had preached the year before. You can go to,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.600]   you can go to Desiring God, March 13, 1983, not four, three.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.840]   And I called it APTAT, A-P-T-A-T, the acronym.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.240]   A, admit you can do nothing. P, pray for supernatural help.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.000]   T, trust a specific promise about your situation.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.760]   A, act, use your will, move. T,
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.160]   thank God.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.520]   I was just blown away that the year after I wrote APTAT,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.160]   I found in my favorite theologian, just about,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.240]   a duplicate of what I was thinking. I thought, this is not,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.200]   I'm not quirky here at all. This is just old fashioned.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.720]   He calls it Augustinian sanctification or something like that.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.880]   The difference between my APTAT and Packer's paragraph is,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.320]   is this.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.720]   He barely mentions my middle T.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.880]   Trust a specific promise about your situation that
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.040]   you're about to walk into. You can hear that he, he means it. He believes it.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.160]   Of course he does. You can hear it in his third point,
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.840]   but it's almost lost. He says, he says it this way. Third,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.080]   you go to work with a goodwill and a high heart.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.040]   And then he says, expecting to be helped. I say, yes,
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.080]   yes, yes, exactly. That's faith.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.120]   Expecting to be helped according to your request for
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.800]   help. But I think this is the biggest difference.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.560]   It's a matter of emphasis. I think this middle T,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.640]   ask, pray, trust. So trust is the middle T, ask, pray, trust,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.160]   act, thank APTAT. The middle T is so crucial.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.520]   I wrote a whole book about it called Living by Faith in Future Grace.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.440]   That's a 400 page book on T.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.880]   We need a book for every one of those letters. But for me,
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.800]   it was so huge that it didn't get muted in 0.3.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.320]   It got blown up in Future Grace.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.880]   That book was really about the middle T,
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.960]   trust a specific promise when you're facing a situation
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.880]   that causes you uncertainty or anxiety or fear.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.080]   And I think that step of T,
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.760]   trust in a specific promise is missing in
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.880]   most Christians attempt to live the Christian
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.680]   life. It's certainly my most common mistake.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.320]   Most of us face a difficult task that makes us
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.200]   anxious. And we remember to say, help me help God.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.760]   I need you.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.720]   So we more or less reflexively express
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.520]   the first two steps, AP,
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.120]   ask or admit, admit helplessness and ask for a
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   pray for help.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.320]   But then we move straight from
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.920]   pray and admit to act.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.360]   We pray and then we act.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.880]   But this robs us of a very powerful
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.000]   step in walking by the spirit,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.240]   walking in the strength that God supplies.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.800]   After we pray for God's help, this is T now,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.040]   we should remind ourselves of a specific promise
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.400]   that God has made and fix our minds on it
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.560]   and put our faith in it.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.200]   How many times, and I wish I did it absolutely consistently,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.080]   because it's so precious when you consistently do it.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.440]   How many times have I said, I believe you,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.200]   I caught myself a promise, like the promise of, I will help you, John Piper.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.600]   I will strengthen you. I'll uphold you. And I say, I believe you.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.040]   I believe you right now, I'm walking into this pulpit.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.720]   I believe you walking onto the stage.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.200]   I believe you walking into this difficult conversation I'm going to have down
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.680]   here at Maria's. I believe you right now.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   This is true. Help is on the way. Increase my faith.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.360]   I'm trusting you, Lord. Here I go. And then, then you act.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.240]   Now Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, 7, we walk by faith.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.920]   Galatians 2, 20, we live by faith.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.680]   But for most of us, this remains vague.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.960]   It's vague. Like I walk through the day and yeah, I guess I'm a believer.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   Of course, I'm a believer as I walk through the day,
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.800]   but am I believing anything specific about God? Anything specific about,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.000]   what he's going to do in the next half hour that I'm struggling with?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.920]   Hour by hour, we need to do this.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:46.800]   We do it by reminding ourselves of specific concrete promises that God has made
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.480]   and Jesus has bought with his blood. 2 Corinthians 1, 20,
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.600]   all the promises of God are yes in Jesus.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:04.040]   And we consciously trust the promises that we have and we act on them.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.960]   So here's my suggestion practically to Jacob for how to put this into practice.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.240]   Read the Bible every day, every day,
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.960]   always on the lookout for specific promises God may want to give you for that very day.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.440]   But don't lean only on the Bible reading for the day.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:33.040]   Memorize a few promises that are so universally applicable to every situation
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:39.120]   that they will serve you when you face a task to be done in the strength that God supplies.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.720]   Then as those tasks come, go through Aptat.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   Admit you can't do this on your own, not fruitfully, not with any eternal significance.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.280]   Pray for the help you need.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.600]   Then call to mind one of your memorized promises and trust it.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   Put your faith in it.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:09.080]   Then act, believing that God is acting in you, through you,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.760]   according to his promise, and then thank him.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.800]   So here are a few of my go-to promises day by day.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.400]   I suppose the most common one over the last 50 years is Isaiah 41, 10.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.880]   "Fear not, John."
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.240]   So I can hear it. I hear God talking. I hear Jesus say this.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.760]   "I bought this for you, John. Fear not, for I'm with you.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.760]   Be not dismayed. I'm your God. I will strengthen you in the next half hour.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.880]   I will help you in the next hour.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.480]   I will hold you up with my righteous right hand in the next day. I will."
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.760]   Do you believe me, John Piper? Do you believe me?
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.600]   Oh, what a difference it makes when you have a concrete word from God,
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:56.120]   from the scriptures, and you believe it as you walk into a difficult, trying situation.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:02.960]   Or Philippians 4, 19, "My God will supply every need of yours,
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.920]   according to his riches in glory." Every need. No question.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   What you need, you'll have. Go.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.440]   Or Hebrews 13, 5 and 6, "I will never leave you.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.000]   I will never forsake you."
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.240]   So we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.840]   I will not fear. What can man do to me?
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.680]   Man can't do anything to me but what God at my side
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.400]   omnipotently permits him to do, because he loves me."
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.480]   And foundational for every one of those, I've got, goodness,
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.880]   I don't know how many of these promises are written down,
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.720]   but here's the last one I'll mention. Romans 8, 32,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.200]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all."
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.440]   So that's the foundation of absolutely everything.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.080]   "Christ died for me.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.640]   How will he not with him graciously give John Piper all things?"
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.360]   What a great promise to walk into every situation with.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.080]   So never cease to ponder Paul's words in Galatians 2, 20,
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.600]   "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.840]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.960]   There's that switch. No longer I, but Christ. And then he explains it.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.560]   "And the life that I now live, oh yes, you do live a life.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:28.000]   In the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.440]   who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.040]   So not I, yet I by faith.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.720]   And I'm simply saying, make it specific.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.800]   By faith in a particular precious promise.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.280]   Yeah, very applicable. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.320]   This episode reminds me of one other episode that featured this trio of texts.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.680]   1 Corinthians 15, 10, and Colossians 1, 29, and 1 Peter 4, 11.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.920]   It was back in our first year, I think it was, APJ 143.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.040]   And it's titled, "Work like an Arminian, Sleep like a Calvinist?"
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.200]   Question mark. "Work like an Arminian, Sleep like a Calvinist?"
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.800]   Great episode to compliment this one. Check it out.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.520]   Thank you for joining us today.
