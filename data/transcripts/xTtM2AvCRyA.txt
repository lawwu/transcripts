[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020]   given to studies of mental health,
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.940]   physical health, and human performance.

[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.900]   So without further ado,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.140]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.780]   The first question is about colds and flus.
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.820]   And the question specifically is,
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.580]   why is it that we get more colds and flus
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.840]   in the winter months?
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.280]   Is it the temperature outside?
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.940]   Is it the fact that people are spending more time indoors?
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.460]   Or is it a myth that we get more colds and flus
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.820]   in the winter months?
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.440]   Well, the first thing is that the research very clearly
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.480]   shows that in winter months,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.500]   there's a greater prevalence of colds and flus.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800]   Now, of course, the words in the winter months
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.520]   means many things.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.700]   For instance, in most areas of the world,
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.560]   unless you live directly near the equator,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.960]   in the winter months means that days are going to be shorter
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.580]   and nights are longer than in the summer months.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.940]   In general, that's true.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.180]   It's of course especially true
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.080]   if you live very far from the equator.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.040]   So imagine somebody living up in Tromsø, Norway,
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.380]   which is very close to the North Pole.
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.380]   In winter, days are very, very short in Tromsø.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.180]   And conversely, in the summer months,
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.900]   days are very, very long in Tromsø, Norway.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.380]   Now, Tromsø, Norway represents an extreme
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.840]   of day length variation according to time of year.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.380]   The closer you get to the equator,
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.880]   the less variation there is in day length
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.340]   and therefore night length across the year.
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.540]   However, in most locations on Earth,
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.740]   days will be significantly shorter
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.240]   by about an hour or two at least
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.980]   for certain parts of the year.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.140]   And in general, shorter days correlate
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.820]   with colder temperatures.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.440]   That's what's really important to know,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.020]   which is that shorter days generally correlate
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.420]   with colder temperatures,
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.980]   regardless of where you live on the planet Earth.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.220]   Okay, so in the winter months, as we're calling it,
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.740]   involves at least two things.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.860]   Shorter days, which means what?
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.620]   It means less sunlight
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.660]   and either more artificial light or more darkness,
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.860]   depending on how much artificial light you rely on.
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.260]   It also means, as we mentioned, colder temperatures.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.580]   Colder temperatures, of course,
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.620]   doesn't necessarily mean that you are exposed
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.120]   to those colder temperatures
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.840]   because what's the third thing?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.680]   Shorter days and colder temperatures outside
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.580]   mean that people are spending more time indoors.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.340]   So what the research clearly shows
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.740]   is that one of the reasons, not the only,
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.820]   but one of the reasons for the greater prevalence
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.580]   of colds and flus in the short days,
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.740]   AKA winter months of the year,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.900]   is that people are spending more time indoors
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.340]   and therefore at closer proximity,
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.780]   which raises a whole bunch of really interesting questions
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.040]   that have been explored in the peer-reviewed research
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.820]   about proximity, cold, and flu transmission.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.920]   There have been studies, for instance,
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.340]   where people come into the laboratory
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.940]   who are suffering from cold and flu and are sneezing,
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.140]   having them sneeze at different proximity
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.200]   to other people.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.380]   Obviously, people are doing this under consent.
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.680]   They're agreeing to participate
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.020]   in these particular experiments.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.180]   And there does seem to be a very nice relationship
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.320]   between physical distance between you,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.500]   the uninfected person, and the sneezing,
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.900]   coughing, nose wiping, eye wiping,
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.220]   we'll get into why I mention all of those things
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.220]   in a moment, person that is suffering from the flu.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.020]   In other words, the closer you are to somebody
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.220]   who's sneezing or coughing,
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.080]   the higher probability that you will contract
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.420]   that cold or flu.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.300]   Okay, so we've already established two things.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.880]   First of all, physical proximity is a key variable
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.380]   in terms of transmission of cold and flu.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.260]   And at some level, that's sort of a duh.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.220]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.860]   if you're in the next room or down the hallway from
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.300]   or across the street from somebody with a cold or flu,
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.580]   you don't expect to contract that cold or flu from them.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.860]   Whereas if you're in the same vehicle with them
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.380]   or you're sitting next to them on an airplane
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.380]   or you are on the same bus or in the same classroom as them
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.260]   and they are sneezing and coughing,
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.200]   well, then the probability that you would get
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   that cold or flu from them is increased.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.700]   That's just obvious.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.300]   But the studies that have explored the relationship
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.240]   between physical proximity and transmission of cold and flu
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.880]   have actually analyzed things down to the range of,
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.420]   well, if you're standing one foot apart
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.900]   or you're standing three feet apart or six feet apart,
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.740]   what's the probability that you will contract
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.620]   that cold or flu?
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.040]   And it follows a very direct relationship
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   where the closer the proximity,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.460]   the more likely that you're going to contract
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.780]   the cold or flu from that person.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.100]   And of course, anything like exchange of skin contact
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.620]   or exchange of saliva,
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.860]   because obviously in cases of romantic relationships
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.060]   where people will kiss or in familial relationships
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.620]   or friendships where people hug,
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.660]   any kind of contact also further increases
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.060]   the transmission of cold and flu,
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.460]   not just from stuff emitted from the nasal passages
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.540]   and from the mouth when people sneeze and cough,
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.220]   but also when people wipe their eyes,
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.740]   even when people wipe their skin,
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.240]   because oftentimes they have cold or flu virus
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.400]   on their skin,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.920]   it doesn't always survive terribly long on the skin,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.300]   but if they wipe their face or wipe their nose
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.540]   or are using tissues
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.920]   and then don't wash their hands thoroughly afterwards,
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.900]   indeed they can transmit cold and flu
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.900]   simply through handshake, okay?
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.680]   So for all you hypochondriacs out there,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.860]   I'm arming you with a lot of useful knowledge
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.720]   that will justify staying away from people
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.160]   who perhaps have cold and flu.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.420]   Now, this particular point about proximity
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.180]   and people being indoors more during the winter months,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.460]   and that's why there's more cold and flu transmission,
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.160]   raises a whole bunch of interesting questions
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.000]   and in fact, protocols that I plan to cover
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.900]   in a Huberman Lab podcast episode solely devoted
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.240]   to colds and flus and how to avoid getting colds and flus.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.100]   But one brief mention or telegraph
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.080]   of what I plan to cover in that episode
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.340]   is that if people are telling you
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.800]   that they are sneezing and coughing due to a cold or flu,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.560]   but that they are quote unquote not contagious,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.420]   either because they are early in the cold or flu
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.720]   or late in the cold or flu,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.460]   and they have these theories or claims that,
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.360]   oh, you know, I'm no longer contagious.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.660]   Keep in mind that anytime someone is sneezing or coughing,
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.320]   they are in fact contagious.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.600]   So I'll get back to that in that full length episode
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.920]   about colds and flus,
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.640]   but I felt it was too important not to mention right now
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.160]   that people's theories about when they are quote unquote
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.100]   contagious or not contagious are rarely substantiated
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.320]   by the actual data.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.800]   The actual data point to the fact
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.480]   that when people are sneezing and coughing,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.040]   if it's due to a cold or flu,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.580]   they are still contagious.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.420]   Okay, so we've established that cold outside
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.160]   means people tend to be indoors more,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.000]   which increases physical proximity,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.040]   which is one of the reasons
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.200]   why there's more cold and flu transmission.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.420]   One of the other reasons why being indoors more
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.900]   tends to increase cold and flu transmission
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.860]   is that in the cold months of winter,
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.580]   when people are indoors,
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.960]   they tend to be not under air conditioning,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.620]   not at neutral temperatures,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.540]   but rather they tend to be in heated rooms.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.080]   And depending on the type of heating that's used,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.140]   but in general, due to all forms of heating,
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.900]   the heated air tends to be drier air.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.660]   Now this is a little bit counterintuitive
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.140]   because if you ever go outside on a really cold winter day,
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.360]   you'll realize that the cold weather outdoors
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.180]   is extremely dry.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.020]   You can almost quote unquote feel the dryness of the air.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.740]   And if you can't quote unquote feel the dryness of the air
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.460]   or imagine what that's like, just imagine this.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.500]   Think of yourself outdoors on a very cold winter day,
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.620]   taking a brisk walk.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.300]   Then think about yourself taking that same brisk walk
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.620]   on a very humid summer day.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.360]   Humidity is of course the concentration of water
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.660]   in the ambient environment, the air,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.460]   whereas the dryness is the lack of humidity.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.740]   And just that little simple gedanken or thought experiment
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.360]   will remind you just how dry the cold air is out of doors
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.740]   during the winter months.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.680]   Whereas indoors, we're heating that air.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.220]   And indeed the heating of that air does have the property
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.580]   of drying the nasal and oral passages,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.620]   but especially the nasal passages.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.680]   So another key reason why there's more transmission
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.380]   of colds and flus in the winter months
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.020]   is because people are spending more time indoors.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.780]   And oftentimes the way those indoor environments
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.460]   are being heated is drying out the nasal passages.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.580]   And the nasal passages represent a primary site of defense
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.380]   for viral infections like colds and flus,
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.000]   but also bacterial infections and fungal infections
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.020]   for that matter.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.280]   Now, I've talked before on this podcast
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.800]   about the importance of using nasal breathing
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.380]   under any conditions where you don't have to breathe
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.220]   through your mouth.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.300]   So if you are not eating, if you're not speaking,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.260]   or if you're not exercising hard, which by the way,
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.200]   oftentimes requires that you breathe through your mouth,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.960]   there's nothing wrong with breathing through your mouth.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.060]   If you're exercising hard and you need to breathe
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.780]   through your mouth in order to bring in enough oxygen,
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.120]   there are conditions under which that's entirely appropriate.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   You can learn more about that in the podcast episode
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.720]   I did all about breathing and breath work.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.540]   But for the most part, it's best to be a nasal breather
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.700]   except under the conditions I just mentioned.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.540]   Why?
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.080]   Well, the nasal passages contain a number
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.120]   of physical barriers, including the hairs within your nose.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.460]   I know that hairs in the nose,
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.420]   especially if they are super numerous,
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.460]   are not considered aesthetically nice.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.580]   People will trim them, et cetera.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.020]   But those hairs in your nose actually serve
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.980]   as a barrier toward infection.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.360]   This is well-established.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.760]   The lining of the nose, the mucosal lining of the nose,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.080]   contains a lot of things.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.380]   First of all, it acts as its own physical barrier
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.920]   and physical trap for incoming viruses,
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.740]   fungal infections, and bacterial infections.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.340]   They literally get trapped in the nasal passages
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.840]   and therefore can't enter deeper into your physiology.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.820]   And right now is not the time to go into the whole anatomy
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.300]   and physiology of the nasal passages, but keep in mind,
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.020]   if you saw the episode that I did with Noam Sobel,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.320]   or you listened to the episode that I did on olfaction,
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.540]   both of those episodes highlight the fact
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.360]   that your brain sits not far behind your nasal passages.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.340]   There's a bony barrier there called the cribriform plate,
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.700]   and there's some other things as well,
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.760]   but it's not far from your nostrils to your brain.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.940]   And it is not far from your nostrils
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.200]   to the rest of your respiratory pathway, of course.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.880]   And so the hairs of your nostrils,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.300]   the mucus itself, and the microbiome,
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.020]   the trillions of little micro bacteria that thrive
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.220]   in the mucosal lining of your nasal passages
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.600]   actually serve to protect against
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.960]   many of the incoming infections.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.280]   This is why it's so important to keep the mucosal lining
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.980]   of your nasal passages thriving and intact.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.820]   How do you do that?
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.340]   Well, one of the best ways to do that is to make sure
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.660]   that the air that you're breathing
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.580]   is sufficiently humidified.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.420]   So while there are many different claims out there
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   about how to avoid colds and flus,
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.600]   as long as we're having a discussion
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.960]   about why there are more colds and flus in the winter months,
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.140]   because indeed there are, it's worth mentioning
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.340]   that if you suffer from colds and flus
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.620]   and you're going to spend a lot of time
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.960]   in a particular indoor environment,
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.740]   you might be wise to find a air humidifier,
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.980]   something that brings more moisture into the air
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.180]   that you're breathing, especially at night
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.500]   while you're sleeping.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.840]   Now, that's not going to prevent the person
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.740]   in your environment who happens to have a cold or flu
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.260]   and is sneezing actively from transmitting that cold or flu,
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.640]   but it will keep your nasal passages
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.260]   and the rest of your respiratory pathways
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.040]   as healthy as they can be and as resistant as they can be
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.320]   to any colds or flus that you might be fighting off.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.440]   And this is another key point,
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.580]   which is regardless of whether or not it's the winter months
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.780]   or the other months of the year,
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.440]   all day long, you're combating
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.080]   different types of infections.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.900]   Different types of viral, fungal, and bacterial infections
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.020]   are bombarding your system, and your immune system
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.900]   counters that both through physical
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.300]   and through neurochemical and hormonal
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.780]   and pure immune mechanisms, okay?
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.980]   There's a whole discussion of this
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.500]   in the episode I did on the immune system.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.780]   We'll do more on this.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.060]   But keeping the air that you breathe, especially at night,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.640]   sufficiently humidified is one great way
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.160]   to try and offset colds and flus
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.780]   that you might be combating
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.920]   because you brought that cold or flu home from work
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.220]   and your immune system needs to ward it off, okay?
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.200]   If you are having a hard time grasping
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.340]   how it is that you could bring home a cold or flu
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.740]   and then ward it off, do you have it, do you not have it?
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.660]   Is it sitting there trying to get into your system
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.100]   or do you have it a little bit?
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.040]   Well, this is some of the gray area
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.800]   around cold and flu and viral transmission generally.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.000]   I mean, we don't know, for instance,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.840]   if you got a mild sniffle
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.400]   as opposed to a really bad cold or flu,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.020]   whether or not it would have been a really bad cold or flu.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.100]   Had you slept less,
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.200]   had you not humidified your air better, et cetera,
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.360]   probably it would be.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.440]   And if you've ever not slept well for a little bit
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.720]   and you're sick, you experience just how much worse
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.080]   that sickness feels.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.040]   The symptoms of that sickness go from very mild to moderate
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.360]   or from mild to moderate to very severe
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.580]   when you are sleep deprived.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.440]   That said, it's also clear that some strains
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.480]   of the cold or flu can be more mild
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.820]   than other strains of the cold or flu.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.960]   So this can be pretty nuanced
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.520]   and we'll go deeper into this in the episode
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.160]   that I do on cold and flu and how to avoid cold and flu.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.680]   But nasal breathing, whenever possible,
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.640]   day and nighttime is extremely important
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.000]   for encouraging the overall health and resistance
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.620]   of your respiratory pathways to incoming cold and flu
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.400]   and other types of viruses.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.620]   Similarly, humidifying the air that you breathe,
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.160]   especially at night, but perhaps also during the day
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   in your office environment or home environment
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.080]   can also be very beneficial for warding off colds and flus.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.520]   And if you'd like to read more about the nasal
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.980]   versus mouth breathing components of colds or flus,
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.320]   I'll just mention one paper now.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.760]   And again, I'll go into this in more depth
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.680]   in the future episode on colds and flus.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.060]   But I want to mention that this is a bi-directional effect,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.200]   meaning people who deliberately breathe through their nose
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.240]   tend to get fewer colds and flus.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.120]   Also people who tend to breathe through their mouth more
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.600]   tend to get more colds and flus.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.520]   Now you might think that's the same thing
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.760]   or just two sides of the same coin, but actually it's not.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.120]   There's what we call a double dissociation
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.560]   whereby if people are mouth breathers,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.680]   they are far more susceptible to colds and flus
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.820]   and other types of respiratory illnesses.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.560]   I'll put a link to one particular paper
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.000]   that I like a lot in the show note captions entitled,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.520]   Association of Oral Breathing with Dental Malocclusions
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.240]   and General Health in Children.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.020]   This paper explores a lot of different things
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.960]   about nasal versus mouth breathing.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.680]   All of which by the way, point to the fact
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.160]   that nasal breathing whenever possible is better for us
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.800]   health-wise, aesthetically, dental health-wise
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.120]   than is mouth breathing.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.040]   But one of the key components here,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.920]   and this is why I bring it up
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.780]   in the context of this discussion is quote,
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.080]   oral breathing is related
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.480]   to a significantly higher prevalence of allergies
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.340]   and a significantly more likely getting sick
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.720]   and taking medication for being sick, okay?
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.440]   So lots in this study, lots in related studies,
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.880]   but nonetheless, being a nasal breather,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.040]   humidifying your air, paying attention
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.840]   to whether or not you're indoors with people
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.080]   who are coughing and sneezing because it's cold outside,
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.640]   all of those things are going to be relevant,
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.040]   perhaps keeping a little bit of distance,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.520]   maybe a lot of distance from those people
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.060]   or encouraging them to wash their hands
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.840]   after they wipe their nose,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.340]   maybe even sending them to a little bit of a,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.240]   not necessarily isolation, although that might be necessary,
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.920]   but keeping them at a distance, right?
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.800]   I don't think it's too much to ask somebody who's sick
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.440]   to not get you sick.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.640]   Personally, I think that's the polite thing to try and do.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.320]   And there's actually not many things ruder
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.520]   than someone who knows that they're sick,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.600]   showing up to something
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.360]   because they didn't want to miss that particular event
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.440]   and getting everybody else sick, frankly.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.320]   That's my opinion.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.800]   I think that opinion is shared
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.760]   with many of you out there as well.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.220]   Now, as I mentioned earlier, when it's cold outside,
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.040]   the air tends to be drier, not always.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.380]   I mean, you could live in an environment
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.280]   that's very cold and very rainy.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.400]   Obviously very rainy is very humid.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.800]   It's maximum humidity if you think about it.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.020]   But if you are going to spend time out of doors
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.960]   in cold days of winter,
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.240]   which by the way is a really good thing for other reasons,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.680]   and I'll get into those reasons in a moment
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.720]   because they relate directly
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.060]   to why there's such a prevalence of colds and flus
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.620]   because in general, people are not doing
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.140]   what I'm about to tell you to do.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.660]   But there are two things to keep in mind
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.900]   if you're going to be out of doors.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.640]   First of all, all the things about proximity still hold.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.360]   There have been studies of people who have colds and flus
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.840]   sneezing in indoor environments versus outdoor environments
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.640]   and how much transmission there is.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.480]   Again, it boils down to proximity.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.800]   Yes, you can get a cold or flu
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.160]   from somebody sneezing out of doors next to you
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.040]   just as well as you can if they sneeze next to you indoors.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.640]   There's a slightly higher probability
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.700]   that you'll get it from them
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.780]   if they're sneezing at that same distance,
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.780]   but you're indoors as opposed to outdoors.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.240]   Obviously, sneezers, coffers,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.600]   sneeze and cough in the other direction,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.080]   cover your mouth and nose.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.900]   If you don't have a tissue or something, we are told,
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.160]   and I subscribe to the idea that sneezing into your elbow
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.560]   or coughing into your elbow is probably the next best thing
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.880]   to not covering up at all as opposed to into your hand,
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.280]   which then you touch other things and yourself.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.980]   Anyway, without getting into the mechanics
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.180]   of sneezing and coughing too deeply,
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.680]   if you're going to be outside in the cold winter months
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.180]   and you'd like to avoid getting colds and flus,
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.820]   when you run, when you exercise, when you walk,
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.200]   when you're in conversation, try to nasal breathe
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.300]   unless you have to mouth breathe.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.740]   And if you can sense your nasal passages
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.080]   or your mouth drying out because of that hard breathing,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.000]   and by the way, exercise during the winter months
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.260]   is still important, so I'm not discouraging people
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.080]   from exercising outdoors during the winter months
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.560]   as long as you can do it safely,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.520]   but if you feel those air passages drying out,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.060]   just be aware that when you take those dried out
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.740]   air passages indoors and you're around other people
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.720]   that might have colds and flus,
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.240]   you are going to be more susceptible.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.300]   So that's cause for taking a hot shower,
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.600]   perhaps if you have access to a steam room or humidifier
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.360]   and rehydrating those nasal and oral passages.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.160]   Now, if you're outside and running and you're breathing hard
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.740]   and your nasal passages are drying out,
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.380]   does that mean that you're more susceptible
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.600]   to colds and flus that are just out in that environment
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.800]   if no one else is around?
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.720]   Chances are no.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.020]   However, what we were all told when we were kids,
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.580]   which is if you go outside and you get a chill,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.840]   it's a good idea when you come back inside
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.520]   to take a hot shower or a hot bath,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.480]   or if you have access to it, a sauna to heat back up,
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.640]   that's also true, why?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.700]   Well, it does seem that there's a relationship
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.900]   between core body temperature
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.600]   and susceptibility to cold and flu.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.160]   And this is something I'm going to go deeply into
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.800]   in the episode on colds and flus.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.740]   Keep in mind that fevers that are the response
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.720]   to exposure to a cold or flu
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.980]   or being full-blown sick with a cold and flu
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.920]   are an attempt of your immune system
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.340]   to heat up that virus and destroy it.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.320]   Keep that in mind if you're considering
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.200]   taking any kind of medication to lower your fever.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.880]   Of course, know that highly elevated body temperatures,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.920]   AKA fever, can be very dangerous to the brain and body.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.520]   There's a fairly limited upper range of temperatures
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.780]   that we can go into before we start damaging ourselves.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.500]   But also keep in mind that fever is an adaptation
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.200]   designed to destroy viruses, okay?
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.400]   So if you blunt the fever,
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.460]   you are actually letting a colder virus
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.900]   to proliferate more readily than it would
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.340]   if you allowed a slight fever to combat that, okay?
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.860]   So there's a whole discussion to be had there
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.300]   because obviously you don't want people
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.380]   cooking their brains due to elevated fever
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.760]   and not treating that fever,
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.460]   but you also don't want to reduce
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.240]   your core body temperature too much,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.940]   which raises the question of things like cold plunges.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.420]   Should you be taking cold showers
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.440]   and doing cold plunges in the winter months
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.080]   when it's already cold and you're susceptible to colds
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.360]   and maybe you're coming down with a cold?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.440]   Should you do that?
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.800]   Ah, well, that segues into the next question
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.580]   that I'm going to answer for this AMA,
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.740]   which relates directly to cold exposure
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.840]   and so-called cyclic hyperventilation breathing,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.140]   sometimes associated with so-called Wim Hof breathing,
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.760]   but other forms of deliberate breathing as well,
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.120]   and how specific forms of deliberate breathing
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.660]   and how deliberate cold exposure
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.660]   can indeed be used to offset or even prevent entirely
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.880]   infection due to bacterial or viruses,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.980]   but if you're already coming down
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.940]   with a bacterial or viral infection,
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.980]   why cyclic hyperventilation breathing
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.660]   or why deliberate cold exposure
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.860]   may actually be the worst thing
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.540]   if you are already contracting or have contracted,
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.420]   if you are contracting or have already contracted
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.580]   a cold or virus.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.860]   So we'll answer that question next.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.960]   In the meantime, just know that, yes, indeed,
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.860]   in the winter months, you are more susceptible
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.940]   to colds and flus because there's more of them going around.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.920]   We talked about some of the reasons
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   why they're going around and some of the things you can do
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.040]   to protect yourself against those colds and flus.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.380]   There are a bunch of other things that you can do
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.940]   that are very valuable that we'll explore
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.380]   in the full length episode on colds and flus
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.720]   and how to avoid getting them,
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.060]   and I'm hoping you all stay clear of colds and flus
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.820]   these winter months, and now you have some tools
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.860]   to try and reduce the duration and severity
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.620]   of those colds and flus should you get one.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.180]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.140]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.500]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.100]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.380]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.580]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.200]   standard channel and premium tools
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.620]   not released anywhere else,
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.740]   please go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.940]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.160]   the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel,
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.020]   it's really twofold.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.940]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.420]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.700]   which of course will still be continued
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.140]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.560]   We are not going to change the format
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.140]   or anything about the standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.580]   and to fund research,
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.620]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.680]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.480]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.660]   that we are most interested in.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.680]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.300]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.260]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.660]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.360]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.660]   and other media channels.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.260]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.440]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.620]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.360]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   in the first place.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.700]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.660]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.300]   to do a dollar for dollar match
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.220]   on all funds raised for research
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.940]   through the premium channel.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.540]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.520]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.580]   to further support research for science
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.360]   and science-related tools for mental health,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.880]   physical health, and performance.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.720]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.480]   for the Huberman Lab premium channel,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.540]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.300]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.660]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.540]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.140]   And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.500]   that other people ask as well.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.460]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.260]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.820]   and various transcripts and protocols of Huberman Lab
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.380]   podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.700]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.060]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.480]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.140]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.040]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.660]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.820]   (upbeat music)
