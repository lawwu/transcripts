[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Over and over in the Bible, it appears that God saves us in order to draw attention to himself.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   This is nowhere clearer than in the first chapter of Ephesians.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   There we are told that God predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Why? To the praise of his glorious grace, verses 4-6.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And again, just a little later, it says that God predestined us.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Again, why? To the praise of his glory, verses 11-12.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And then Paul even says our eternal security is sealed with the promise of the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Why? To the praise of his glory, verses 13-14.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So why does God predestine us, save us, adopt us, and eternally secure us in order to draw attention to himself?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Here's how Pastor John explained it in a 2010 sermon.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   You cannot, you cannot grasp, that is, you cannot experience consciously the love of God for you.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   You cannot, apart from omnipotent, divine, supernatural power enabling you to experience it.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Here's a prayer from Ephesians. You don't need to look it up. Just listen carefully.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Chapter 3, verse 18.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "I pray," this is Paul now praying for the Ephesians in the way I pray for you, for myself, for my family.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   "I pray that you may have strength to know the love of Christ."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   You can't know it without power.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Does that strike you as odd?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   You should give a lot of thought to that.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Why can't I know what it is to be loved without divine power?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I'll keep reading that prayer.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   "I pray that you may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge."
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   The love of Christ, the love of God, surpasses the powers of the mind to comprehend and the powers of the human heart to experience.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It surpasses our fallen capacities to handle with our brain and to experience with our heart.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It goes beyond what you're able to do, which is why Paul is praying and why I pray for myself this way and for you this way.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   "May you have strength to comprehend the love of Christ."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Soul strength, heart strength, mind strength.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   "May God give this to us now."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Now, in this service.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   This is why Paul said in Romans 5 verse 5, "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   The love of God pours into you not by any human agency, by the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   It's a divine thing to know yourself loved by God.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   You're not able to on your own.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Now, the question I posed last week was, "Why is it that the Bible reveals the love of God for us, including God's making so much of us?"
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Why is it that he reveals his love for us, his making so much of us in ways that constantly call attention to his own glory?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Why does he do it that way?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And the answer is this.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   If God didn't do it that way, if he didn't love us in a way that constantly called attention back to his glory as the source, as the essence, as the goal.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   If he didn't do it that way, we would be so much more likely to turn the love of God into a subtle means of self-exaltation.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   We would use his love to make ourselves the deepest foundation of our joy, instead of himself.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   God would become the servant of our slavery to self.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   We would take our preciousness to God and make that very preciousness to God our God.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   But I argued, God loves us so much.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   We are so precious to him that he will not let that happen.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   We are so precious to God that God in great mercy will not let our preciousness to him become our God.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   We will indeed, hear this carefully, we will indeed through all eternity enjoy being made much of by God.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   That will be a profound ingredient in our joy in God.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   That he makes so much of his sons and his daughters.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But he will work in us such a holiness, such a sanctification, such a freedom from sin that he will protect us from making that the bottom of our joy.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   The bottom of our joy will always be that he's the kind of God who delights in us.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   The bottom of our joy will always be that he's the kind of God who makes much of the likes of me.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   This grace, this grace will be the apex of my joy, the apex of my praise forever.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It will never terminate here, it will always go back there from him, through him and to him are all things.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   God himself will be the beginning, the middle and the end in his love for me.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   That is a profound consideration.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   That was from Pastor John's sermon from April 25th, 2010 titled "Consider Your Calling."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Consider your calling.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Find the whole message online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John in a recent or an old message, send it to me.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I'd love to see it.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Give me the timestamp from the audio clip of when it begins and when it ends.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Tell me why that clip has impacted you so much and then give me your name and the closest city to you.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   If I use your clip, I want to give you credit.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And just email me all of that information at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   That's the email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And if you would, put the word "clip" in the subject line somewhere and I'll find it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Easy enough. I'm always interested to hear which sermon clips have most impacted your life.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Well, how important is extra-biblical texts to how we interpret the meaning of our Bibles?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   That seems to be the assumption behind the question that's up next time.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Although, the actual question is one about why does the author of Hebrews belabor Christ's supremacy over angels?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's a specific question, but I think it gives a much broader topic that is very relevant to every Bible reader.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   You won't want to miss this one. I'm Tony Reinke and we'll see you on Friday.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Thanks for joining us today. We'll see you then.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   [End]
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   [End]
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   [End]
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   [End]
