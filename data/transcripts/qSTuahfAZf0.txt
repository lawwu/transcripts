[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   This is what's so tragic about China.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.440]   Think about how many people have been lifted out of poverty.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.080]   So many since Deng Xiaoping.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.320]   Hundreds of millions.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.440]   It is a great achievement of our lifetimes.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.520]   It's happened since you were born.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.360]   And why did that happen?
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.600]   It's China's reintegration into the rest of the world
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.800]   of joining the maritime order, following the basic credit card
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.920]   rules of paying for transactions,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.560]   and then your transactions are also guaranteed.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.440]   That is the win for China.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.720]   The true win.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.000]   And taking Taiwan, who needs it?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.760]   The Taiwanese are perfectly fine doing their own thing.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.360]   And they've made it clear they don't want
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.720]   to be taken over by force.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.840]   Who would be?
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.000]   So the problem in China is the Communist Party
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600]   wants to maintain its monopoly on power.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.840]   And for a while there under Deng Xiaoping,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.640]   that worked because the reforms that they
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.600]   wanted to make for agriculture and things,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.080]   they could maintain their monopoly of power
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.000]   and but do things that allowed people to get much wealthier.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600]   And so that went in tandem for a number of years.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.960]   Now we're at the inflection point
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.880]   where you have a lot of educated people and businesses
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.760]   who are really integrated in the world
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.560]   and they want to make autonomous decisions.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.320]   Also, you wind up with some very large, very successful
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.600]   companies and they have quite a bit of clout.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.240]   And the Communist Party worries about this
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.080]   because what do people want at that point?
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.960]   It's probably some influence over political decisions.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.480]   And the Communist Party said that's off the table.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.000]   A lot of Westerners, when they think of governments,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.720]   think about governments operating
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.760]   in the interest of their population.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.800]   So when their decisions don't improve
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.680]   standards of living, security, and things,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.320]   then we say those aren't good decisions.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.960]   But that's not the game.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.720]   In China, for instance, it's all about
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.400]   maintaining the monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party to rule.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.280]   And if that conflicts with having higher living standards,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.720]   you better believe they're choosing Communist Party.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.280]   So you're watching those kinds of decisions going on right now
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.560]   where their most talented entrepreneurs
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   are being relieved of their enterprises.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560]   And so it used to claim the moral rectitude card.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.000]   Well, they can't do that anymore, they're so corrupt.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.680]   And they used to claim the economic growth card.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.480]   Well, that one's going away.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   So they're left with one card, it's the nationalism card.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.080]   And they're playing it butt hard,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.320]   because it's a unifying thing for Chinese,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.160]   for the Han ethnic group in China,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.840]   who constitute the overwhelming majority,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.080]   that Taiwan should be theirs.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   It's a mistake.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.520]   It will be a pivotal error if they make that mistake.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.320]   If you listen to their speeches,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.520]   they tell you they're gonna do it, right?
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.800]   They're consistent.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.480]   And the West learned that you read improbable speeches, right?
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.440]   People read Mein Kampf and said, "Oh, this is a nutcase.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.400]   No one would ever do that."
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.960]   Well, it quite accurately represented.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.200]   People, even in dictatorships,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.880]   they have to transmit message to population,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.360]   and they quite often, very accurately,
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   tell you what they're gonna do.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.120]   Putin has been quite clear what he's been up to.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.480]   Stalin was very clear what he was up to.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.720]   So let's judge Xi Jinping at his word,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.520]   and he says he's gonna go for it.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.240]   For the People's Republic to take Taiwan,
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.200]   I presume it's gonna begin with an artillery barrage.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.800]   I presume that's gonna be leveling Taiwanese cities, right?
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.200]   Just watch how it goes in Ukraine.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.960]   I can't imagine the Chinese being less brutal.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.240]   They'll hurt themselves.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.000]   Whereas if they just ignore the Taiwan thing and say,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.520]   "Oh, they're so annoying.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.680]   Let them run their own place.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.080]   Who wants them anyway?"
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.600]   And then trade with them, they'll both make money.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.120]   The global order, it's based on sovereignty.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.400]   If you allow this,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.880]   it doesn't mean you have to go to a nuclear war.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.360]   You just never recognize whatever it is.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.640]   And then you sanction China from then until kingdom come
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.040]   so that they are not part of the maritime trading order.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   And you tell them they need to cough up Taiwan.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   This is how sanctions work.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.720]   People look at sanctions and go, "Oh, they don't work,"
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.960]   because you don't make whoever's annoying you
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.400]   change whatever they're doing.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.680]   What they do do is they suppress growth
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.440]   so that whoever's annoying you,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.640]   over time, you're stronger and they're weaker.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.240]   And the example of the impact of sanctions
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.560]   is compare North and South Korea.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.160]   It's powerful over several generations.
