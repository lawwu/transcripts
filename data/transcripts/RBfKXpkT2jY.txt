[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.720]   the Gospel according to Saint John in chapter 4 reading verses 13 and 14.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.120]   Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again;
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.040]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.400]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.200]   everlasting life."
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.720]   Now we are considering these great words spoken by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to the
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.720]   woman of Samaria.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.200]   That is the great offer of the Christian Gospel.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.720]   That is the condition in which we should all be as Christian people.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   Never thirst.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.640]   It's an all-inclusive word.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.440]   It doesn't matter what the state of the world is, whether it be at peace or in the
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.960]   midst of war.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.920]   The Christian should never thirst.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.880]   He is rendered immune to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.680]   He is rendered immune to any trial and tribulation that may come across his path.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160]   But the great question is, do we know this?
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.240]   Have we got this well of water springing up within us?
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.320]   Are we in this condition in which we never thirst?
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.400]   Alas, there are many things that rob us of this experience.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.120]   We are at the moment considering especially some of these hindrances to the obtaining
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.640]   of this fullness of the Lord Jesus Christ, which gives perfect, enduring satisfaction,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.200]   as they are illustrated in the case of this woman of Samaria.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   And at the moment we are dealing with the hindrance that arises from the fact that our
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:08.080]   ideas of worship, our ideas of God, the God whom we worship, tend to be so wrong and so
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   fallacious.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.040]   Now let me read to you therefore from verse 19 to verse 24 in this same chapter.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.760]   The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.840]   Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.880]   men ought to worship.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.440]   Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.680]   The hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   Father.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.520]   Ye worship ye know not what.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:03.080]   The hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   truth.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.200]   For the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   God is a spirit, or God is spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.800]   and in truth.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.040]   Now there is nothing more important than this.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.800]   As we were trying to show last Sunday morning, we reach the highest point that any human
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.760]   being can ever reach when we worship God.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   But the great question is, do we know what it means to worship?
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.400]   Do we know whom we worship?
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.520]   Our Lord said to this woman, You, he said, and all who belong to you are Samaritans.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.280]   You don't know what you're doing.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.840]   Ye worship ye know not what.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.560]   You're worshipping in ignorance, in blindness, in darkness.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   It's superstition.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.040]   There's no purpose in it, there's no value in it.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.600]   We know what we worship, whom we worship.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.000]   And this, as I'm trying to show from this teaching here, is the most important thing
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.600]   that we can ever discover.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.800]   Is there anything more tragic than that people should be fooling themselves, imagining that
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.120]   they're worshipping God, and yet doing something which according to our Lord's own teaching
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   is quite valueless?
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.960]   Now, my friends, isn't this rather appropriate on this particular morning, Remembrance Sunday,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.640]   the various meetings that are being held even while you and I are here at this very moment?
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.680]   What is the meaning?
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.800]   What is the value of these?
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.740]   This is a very important question.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.600]   If we believe that the only hope for the human race is in a knowledge of God, and is to be
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.880]   blessed by God, well then nothing is more important than worship and prayer.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:15.740]   Therefore, you see, we are dealing here with the very essence of a modern problem and condition.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.840]   Everything else is failing, there's no need to waste any time in illustrating that.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.900]   In spite of all the efforts of mankind throughout the centuries, the long history of what is
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.020]   called civilisation, it's a record of failure.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.100]   And the world is in as desperate a condition today as it's ever been, if not indeed worse.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.660]   And there is no hope.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.180]   From the standpoint of man, our hope is in God.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.420]   And now today people in large numbers are at inerrit adopting the attitudes and the
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.260]   postures of prayer and of worship.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.900]   But haven't we a right to ask, do they know what they're doing?
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.100]   Is there any meaning in it?
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.700]   What is all this?
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.780]   Is it real worship or not?
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.620]   The Samaritans thought they were worshipping God.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.060]   And we ourselves know from our own experiences that we've often imagined that we've been
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.220]   worshipping God when we've been doing nothing whatsoever.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.140]   From the standpoint of this teaching, there is nothing, I say, which is more important
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.140]   than this.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.340]   I'd be wasting your time and mine if I were just to speak this morning on the state of
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.940]   the world and give my opinion on the international problem and try to suggest to statesmen how
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.700]   they can solve them all.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.300]   That is not only folly, it's sheer impertinence.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.720]   I'm in no position to do that.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.220]   And when the Christian church spends the morning like this in doing that, she's displaying
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.340]   her ignorance of her own truth.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.060]   No, no.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:59.940]   We are here to teach people how to worship, how to know the only true and living God.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.220]   And nothing matters but this.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:10.980]   Kings and princes, potentates and powers, they're all mortal and are all going to die.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.260]   But the soul still remains face to face with God.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:22.340]   Very well then, this, I say, is not only the right thing to do, it is the only relevant
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.540]   thing to do at a time such as this.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.360]   This is the instruction that the world needs above everything else.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.380]   And it is only obtainable from this book.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.740]   Our Lord says, "We know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews."
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.260]   He means by that all the teaching of the Old Testament.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.940]   God had manifested himself to this people in a peculiar manner, and he gives his truth
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.940]   through them.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.540]   They are to be the teachers of the whole world.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:56.340]   It was to them and to them alone he gave his living oracles, the lively oracles of God.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.340]   And there is no knowledge in connection with worship and these things apart from that which
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:07.300]   we have revealed unto us in the Scriptures, in what we call the Bible.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:13.660]   We have tied entirely to this, and we've already been seeing what worship really means.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.100]   It means bowing down in the presence of God.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:23.260]   And all that we do in a service such as this is meant to lead to that, and if it doesn't,
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.700]   the service to that end has failed.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.340]   So we started with the true idea of worship and the true idea of God.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.660]   God is spirit.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:41.140]   And God, blessed be his holy name, is also the Father.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.060]   Now that's the starting point you see, but it doesn't end with it.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.300]   Our Lord teaches this woman that she must be clear and right in her ideas as to what
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.460]   worship is and as to who and what God is.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.660]   We must start with it.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.020]   You see the assumption is we all know who God is and we can go into his presence whenever
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.020]   we like.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.980]   Some people only attempt or even think they do so once a year, Armistice Sunday, Remembrance
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.500]   Sunday, whatever we call it now, and perhaps Easter Sunday in addition.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.340]   But my dear friends, that's blasphemy.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.980]   It can be nothing but sheer blasphemy.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:28.540]   If God is God and if we know who God is and what God is, we should be constantly seeking
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.700]   his presence and bowing ourselves down before him.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.700]   Not occasionally, but constantly.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:42.220]   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.300]   and all thy strength.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:54.780]   Everything we have and are and always should be directed towards him and his eternal glory.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:01.500]   But now having started with that, you notice that our Lord also teaches the woman what
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.680]   is necessary on our side as it were.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.820]   You start with the true notion of worship and the true idea of God, but still you must
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:17.420]   learn, we must all learn, how exactly we are to worship this only true and living God.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:25.660]   And our Lord's answer is that we must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.940]   And this is the thing to which I now want to direct attention.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.740]   But I take them in the reverse order.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:40.580]   We must worship God in truth and we must worship God in the spirit.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:47.660]   I take them in this order because we start with ourselves and we work up to what is ultimately
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.380]   most important of all.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.940]   What does he mean by saying that we have to worship God in truth?
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.460]   Now here is the most important thing.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.100]   You see he's contrasting it with the false worship.
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:08.500]   It's not worthy of the name, but the false idea of worship that characterized the life
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.460]   of the Samaritans.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.780]   So he says it's got to be in truth.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.940]   What does this mean to us in practice?
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:21.340]   Well the first thing it means is this of course, that it must never be thoughtless.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:28.420]   You can't worship God in truth if you don't stop to consider what you're doing.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:37.060]   Thoughtlessness is the reverse of truth and of the realization of what you're doing.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.740]   I needn't stay with this, we all know what it means because we've all been so guilty
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.900]   at this point.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.700]   We can come to this house of God Sunday by Sunday and never realize what we're doing,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.900]   never stop to think.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.540]   We may come to meet one another, have happy fellowship together, all right, but is that
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.020]   the object of it?
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   Do we stop to think?
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.380]   Do we ask ourselves what are we doing?
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.740]   Why am I going there?
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.700]   What is the meaning of all this?
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.980]   Thoughtlessness is the opposite of truth.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:14.100]   Mechanical worship is the opposite of worshipping in truth.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.540]   And when I say mechanical, you see, I mean that we do it out of habit or a custom or
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.060]   that something else dictates it to us.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.580]   That is why you've got to be careful on a day like this.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:34.220]   If it is the day that makes people go through certain motions, they're not worshipping
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.740]   at all and it's certainly not worshipping in truth.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.300]   Their thoughts are governed by something else, by history, by events, by the past, by the
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   future.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:50.500]   And really they're not worshipping because it's not central in their minds.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.420]   The occasion becomes more important than the act of worship, and to put anything before
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:01.100]   God is to cease to worship him, is indeed to insult him.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.340]   But we are all subject to this, we are all prone to this.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.540]   We don't stop, we don't think.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.540]   It's the thing to do.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.880]   Everybody does it.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.000]   And so like sheep, we do it.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.060]   My dear friends, there is such a thing as national hypocrisy as well as personal hypocrisy.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.460]   And to me all this is so important for this reason.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.420]   The masses of the people in this country today are outside the Christian Church, especially
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.420]   the so-called working classes.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.420]   Why are they outside?
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:36.460]   Here's our great problem, here's our greatest question today.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.180]   Why is it that they won't even stop to consider this?
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:45.140]   Well if you talk to them, you'll find that you'll get your answer in some shape or form
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:49.260]   that they've reacted against hypocrisy.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.420]   A lot of nonsense they say.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:56.740]   The Christian Church unfortunately has given the impression that she's on the side of
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.740]   power and of might.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.420]   And of course she's done this in every country.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:08.340]   And so you've had the different countries praying for their success in war, both sides
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.380]   doing it at the same time.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.860]   And the average man thinks of the Christian Church as an agent of the state.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.780]   The Christian Church is regarded as a sort of court chaplain.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.900]   The authorities turn to the church for prayers when they're in need or when they're in
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.900]   trouble.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:32.340]   Now the people have got hold of that idea and thus they reject the whole thing.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:39.900]   So it is for us to tell them that worship must be true, it must be in truth, it mustn't
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.780]   be thoughtless, it mustn't be mechanical, it mustn't be governed by something else.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:50.620]   It must be governed by one thing only and that is our realization of whom it is we are
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:59.140]   approaching, what he is, and why we should all always approach him with reverence and
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.140]   godly fear.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.500]   Now this is, this should be obvious, shouldn't it?
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.220]   And yet isn't this the amazing thing?
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.220]   We're all guilty.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.500]   I'm as guilty as any of you.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.180]   How often have I got on my knees and said my prayers but my thought has been elsewhere.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.500]   I haven't stopped for a second to realize what I'm doing.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.780]   I've rushed through it as it were so that I could go on to do something else.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.660]   But that's not worshipping God in truth.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:33.540]   My dear friends, we've got to start by, I nearly said and let's say it in order that
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.060]   you may remember it, we've got to start by stopping.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.140]   What I mean by that is you don't start speaking at once, you stop.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:48.500]   You think, you recollect, you realize what you're doing, you ask questions, you prepare
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.820]   yourself.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.540]   Worship is impossible apart from that.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.380]   Never must it be thoughtless.
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.100]   It must always be in truth.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.020]   And that leads me to the second point which is, and it follows of course from that first,
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.740]   it must never be hypocritical, it must never be dishonest.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.780]   Now there is always an element of thought in hypocrisy.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:16.300]   That is why hypocrisy is actually worse than thoughtlessness.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.980]   The hypocrite in a sense does know up to a point what he's doing.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.180]   He's quite deliberate.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:30.300]   There is this deliberate element in hypocrisy and it is therefore to that extent dishonest.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:40.500]   It is this whole idea that somehow or another we can fool God, we can use him.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.500]   Meaning that he's satisfied if we turn to him now and again when we need him and then
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.980]   carry on without him when everything's going well.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.780]   And again we've all been guilty of this.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.380]   We've all done this.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.740]   We think we can use God.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.480]   Individuals have thought this, nations think this.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.740]   This is an expression of the national hypocrisy to which I have been referring.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.380]   But oh how utterly foolish this is.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.940]   The biggest fool in the world is the hypocrite.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:18.380]   He's in a much worse state and condition as I said than the man who doesn't think at all.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.820]   Because he at any rate is saying well I'm going to turn to God.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.140]   I'm going to worship God for his own reasons.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.100]   But he doesn't stop and realize what he's doing.
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.860]   Now the Bible goes out of its way to give us instruction on this particular thing, on
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.220]   the utter folly of hypocrisy apart from anything else.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.500]   Listen to it.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.420]   You see it gives us instruction like this.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:46.580]   Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place?
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.420]   He that hath clean hands and a pure heart.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.420]   That's how it starts.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.740]   Or take David.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.300]   David was an expert on this matter.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.220]   David was a man of God, of course he was.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.780]   But he often played the hypocrite.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.300]   His lusts, his passions got the better of him.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.740]   He hadn't finished with God but he thought that he was managing this thing.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.700]   He'd forgotten that God sees everything in his greatest crime of all is adultery and
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.700]   murder.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.420]   David was very happy, thought all was well.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.420]   Why well?
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.940]   Because he'd become a hypocrite.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:25.660]   He'd forgotten what he really knew about God but oh he was brought to his senses and he
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.900]   passed through a hell of repentance, an agony of repentance.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.300]   When God through his servant Nathan the prophet revealed the truth to him and so he puts it
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.300]   like this in the 51st Psalm.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:47.260]   Behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.380]   God wants truth in the inward parts.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.340]   God is never satisfied with an external appearance.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.540]   That is of course the essence of hypocrisy.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.160]   It's putting on a mask.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.220]   It's putting on an appearance.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.500]   It is satisfaction with the external and the outward and covering over that which is within.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.260]   That is the essence of hypocrisy.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.980]   But it's no good.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:15.500]   Thou desirest truth in the inward, innermost parts and nothing else will satisfy God but
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.500]   that.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   He knows all.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.500]   He sees all.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.460]   Nothing is or can be hidden from his holy sight.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.980]   Or take it again in Psalm 66.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:32.220]   The psalmist says if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.620]   And when he says if I regard iniquity in my heart he means if I regard it fondly.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:43.980]   If I fondly, if I keep it there, if I shield it, I go to God and my conscience accuses
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.460]   me but I cover over this thing.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.780]   I say it's alright.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.780]   I want this.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.460]   I want God but I want this also.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.180]   I'm regarding iniquity in my heart.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.540]   I'm covering it, I'm fondling it, I'm shielding it, I'm protecting it, I'm making sure that
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.540]   it goes.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.660]   If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.340]   I can fall on my face to the ground.
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.420]   It won't help me.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.180]   I can take all the postures and the attitudes, all the appearances of worship but it's no
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.180]   good.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.860]   The Lord will not hear me.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:24.020]   So you see, you find the psalmist later going on to say something like this.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.740]   Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:37.740]   Try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.100]   way everlasting.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.100]   Now that's it.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.860]   Now this man's getting right you see.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.660]   He can't trust himself.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.220]   He can't trust his own self-examination.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.220]   He's been doing that.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.220]   He's realized that he's a hypocrite so he does stop and think and question and examine
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.220]   himself but he realizes that even this is enough.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.860]   We are so subtle and sin is so subtle within us that we'll manipulate things to suit our
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.020]   own case.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:08.140]   So he turns to God and says, "Search me, O God, you do it."
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.260]   I dare not trust the sweetest friend.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.140]   I can't trust myself.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.500]   God must examine me.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.020]   Now this is the teaching you see.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.900]   It runs right through the book of Psalms and you get the prophet saying exactly the same
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.900]   thing.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.460]   "Who shall dwell with the burning fire?"
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.820]   These are the questions that the men of God have always asked and you get exactly the
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.140]   same teaching in the New Testament.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.940]   Did you notice what I read out of 1 Timothy 2 verse 8?
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:46.340]   "I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and without
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.340]   doubting."
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.060]   Holy hands, clean hands.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:56.980]   Without wrath, without pride, without a bitter national spirit or without wrath against an
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.300]   individual.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.700]   There must be no wrath.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:06.620]   Clean hands, without wrath and without doubting.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.860]   And the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, he teaches precisely the same thing.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.020]   You notice these instructions.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.860]   Same in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:22.340]   Listen to this in Hebrews 10, verses 19 and following.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:28.860]   "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.900]   a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say his
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:40.260]   flesh, and having an eye preached over the house of God, let us draw nearer."
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.260]   How?
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.700]   With a true heart.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:50.100]   That's the first thing he emphasizes, with a true heart in full assurance of faith.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.620]   But you see without this true heart, which means without honesty.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.140]   We must have a true heart.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.980]   There must be no dishonesty there.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.100]   There must be truth in the inward part.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.580]   The heart must be honest, it must be open.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:11.020]   And without this, whatever we may do, individually or nationally, it's a mockery, it's a sham,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.700]   and God won't hear us.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.900]   We've got to come with a true heart.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.780]   This is a part of worshipping God in truth.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.780]   But we must go beyond that.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.780]   The heart must also be a united heart.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.380]   It mustn't be divided.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:35.380]   So you remember the psalmist again, praise in Psalm 86 verse 11, "Teach me thy way,
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.860]   O Lord.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.780]   I will walk in thy truth.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.660]   Unite my heart to fear thy name."
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.580]   Now we all know again something about this.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.780]   The divided heart.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.700]   The psalmist knew himself.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.660]   He knew that there were parts of him that were right, parts that were wrong, parts that
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.900]   desired God, parts that desired the opposite.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:12.940]   Oh, the Apostle Paul has put it once and forever for us in Romans 7, "With my mind acknowledging
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.860]   the truth of God's law and its rightness, and desiring to live it and to practice it.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.820]   But I find another law in my members, and here is the division."
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:28.860]   Well, you can think of all that in terms of the heart, a divided heart.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.900]   Heart desiring God, heart desiring evil.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.900]   And the great problem in life is how to have a united heart, how to be whole, how to be
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:45.220]   unanimous, how to bring the whole of our being and personality to this great place in which
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.900]   we realize that nothing is higher or greater or more wonderful than worshipping God and
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.940]   praying unto him.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.180]   James puts this in terms of the double-minded men.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.900]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:06.300]   I mean exactly the same thing in this sense, that it's the division again.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:14.220]   It can be a division, an uncertainty in the mind as well as in the desire, but it means
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.140]   that there's no unanimity in us.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:24.660]   And isn't this one of the things that curses all of us, this difficulty of uniting ourselves,
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:30.380]   bringing ourselves into this oneness, and you're never really in the position of truth
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.860]   until you're one and until you're unanimous.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:38.100]   There must be nothing against, there must be no lie, there must be nothing hidden, nothing
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.100]   unworthy.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:47.220]   "Unite my heart to fear thy name."
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.300]   And this is a part of worshipping God in truth.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.540]   The whole being is involved.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.700]   "All thy heart and soul and mind and strength again."
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.700]   There it is, every part of you.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.120]   There's nothing left out.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:10.360]   It is a total allegiance to God, a total seeking of God, a total prostration of oneself in
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.440]   the presence of his majesty.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.240]   As John Wesley put it in that quotation I gave you last Sunday morning.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.840]   Very well, these you see are the things that are absolutely essential, and then you go
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.160]   on and this is what it all leads to.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.520]   When we have thought like this and realized something of what we are doing, and when we
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:41.280]   have realized what's true inside us, you see you come to a point in which you're humbled,
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:46.120]   and you're broken, and you're contrived.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.040]   Now look at the eloquent teaching that you've got about this in the Bible itself.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.780]   Thank God for it.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:27:01.600]   This is the paradox, if you like, of the godly life and of the Christian life, that this
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   is the thing that brings one immediately into the presence of God.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.000]   It's the opposite of the world and all its thinking and all its ideas.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.560]   The world teaches us self-confidence, self-assurance.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.640]   It gets us to look at ourselves, to take pride in ourselves individually and nationally.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.480]   It's always boosting our ego in various forms.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   And the more it does it, of course, the further it gets from God.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:37.900]   God is the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy, but he dwells
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.720]   with the humble and the contrived and the broken heart.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:47.080]   A broken heart, says David, thou wilt not despise.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.400]   David was farthest from God when he was relying upon himself, his powers and prerogatives
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.160]   as a king, his right to get anything he wanted, even another man's wife.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.600]   David was then furthest away from God.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:07.840]   But he gets back into the presence of God when his heart is broken, a humble and a contrived
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.800]   heart, thou wilt not despise.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.240]   And this is an essential part of worshipping God in truth.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.280]   We are not worshipping God unless we are humble, unless we are broken.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.840]   And surely, my dear friends, isn't this the very element that is most lacking in us at
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.560]   the present time?
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.520]   The trouble with us as a generation of Christian people is that we are all so healthy.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.280]   We are all so happy, as it were, so glib, so easy.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.160]   How many broken Christians do you know?
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.040]   How many humbled Christians?
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.480]   There seems to be a type of Christian today that's never repented, doesn't know what
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:54.040]   it means, has never been humbled in the presence of Almighty God.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:59.080]   There is nothing more terrible than to go into the presence of God in any shape or form
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.000]   or sense, in a self-confident manner.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.240]   Now, you needn't take my word for this, this was the whole trouble with the Jews at the
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.800]   time of our Lord.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.840]   It was the whole trouble with the Apostle Paul.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:20.600]   I'm going to read to you in a minute Philippians 3, 3, where Paul says, "We are the circumcision
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:29.000]   who worship God in the Spirit, who rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   the flesh."
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.840]   And then he goes on to say, "Though I might also have confidence in the flesh, if any
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:43.000]   other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more circumcise
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.600]   the eighth day of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and Hebrew of the Hebrews,
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.400]   as touching the law, a Pharisee concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.880]   righteousness which is of the law, blameless."
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:03.040]   And he used to go to God like that, thanking God that he was such a man.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.080]   But he realized that he'd never worshipped, that that's a mockery, it's a sham, it was
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.600]   a form of blasphemy.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   That's what he came to see.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.600]   That was the very essence of his conversion.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:20.400]   You see, our Lord has put it in exactly the same way in his parable of the Pharisee and
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.720]   the publican that went up into the temple to pray.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:30.080]   The Pharisee marches right up to the front and says, "I thank thee, O God, that I'm
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.320]   not as other people are, and especially as this publican.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   I fast twice in the week, I give a tenth of my goods to the poor."
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.800]   He thinks he's worshipping.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.640]   He thinks he's pleasing God, he feels all is well.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.720]   What's the matter with the man?
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.640]   He's never been humble.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   He is congratulating himself in the presence of God, he's thanking God that he is what
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.720]   he is, and the contrast with the publican.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.120]   My friends, that's the opposite of worshipping in truth, that's a lie.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.880]   No man can stand like that in the presence of God.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.680]   It's the other man who's worshipping, the poor publican, who just gets in inside the
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:17.160]   door and who's ashamed even to lift up his face and to look to heaven, beats his breast
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   and says, "God, have mercy upon me, a sinner.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.200]   Be propitiated, if you like, to me, a sinner."
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.680]   That's the man that goes home justified, says our Lord.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   Why?
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.200]   Well, you see, here's a man who's humbled.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   Here is a man who realizes he is nothing.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   To approach God with any kind of pride or self-satisfaction, whether it be personal
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   or national, is a mockery of worship.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.880]   It comes near, I say again, to blasphemy in the sight of God.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.800]   Yet that's the thing of which we're all guilty.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:02.120]   So now, if we realize who God is, if we realize the truth about ourselves, we shall be humbled
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.120]   and broken.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.080]   Have you ever felt that you've no right to go to God?
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.800]   I don't think we've ever really been to God unless we've known that, that we have no right
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   to turn to him, no right to pray.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:21.360]   "Who am I?" says David, at the height of his glory, "Who am I and who are my people that
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.560]   we should be coming like this and building a house for your name and for your glory and
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   for your worship?
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   Who am I?
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.120]   I'm unworthy of this.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.360]   My people are unworthy of this."
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:40.480]   That's worshipping in truth, realizing your utter nothingness and your entire dependence
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.720]   upon the love and the grace, the mercy and the compassion of God.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:51.640]   God is to be approached with reverence and godly fear.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:57.080]   How much godliness there is, how much reverence and godly fear do you see today, with your
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.400]   bright and breezy services and everything going with a swing?
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.520]   My dear friends, let's come back to the Scriptures.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.160]   God's to be worshipped in truth.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:15.440]   You can never worship God self-confidently, nor you're a Christian, always with reverence,
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.840]   with godly fear.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:24.560]   Our Lord prayed like this, "Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, holy
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.680]   Father."
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:33.800]   He said when he prayed himself, "We come then confessing our sins, acknowledging our unworthiness,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.840]   admitting that we're not worthy of the very least of God's mercies."
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.400]   That's the way to pray.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.360]   That is worshipping in truth.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:50.000]   But then you see he goes on to say that we must also worship in spirit.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.520]   They that worship him must worship him in spirit or in truth.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.640]   There are those who say that this should be translated like this, that they should worship
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.640]   by the spirit.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.680]   All right, it comes to exactly the same thing.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.340]   There is really no difference.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.160]   But it is the most important thing, this is the most important thing of all.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.920]   The other is but preliminary.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.440]   The other is really that which should be dictated to us by common sense alone.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.240]   But it isn't, and we need the instruction of the scripture.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.180]   And the scripture comes to us and it knocks us down.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.760]   And if we haven't been knocked down by it, we don't know it.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:33.680]   But then you see you go on to this positive, worshipping in the spirit or by the spirit.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.760]   And this is the thing that's emphasized everywhere about worshipping the New Testament.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.920]   You get it in the Old Testament in a degree.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.000]   But the Old Testament was really prophesying this.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.800]   Joel, you remember in his great prophecy, which was quoted by the apostle Peter on the
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.900]   day of Pentecost, he saw this.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.080]   This is what the prophets were given to see.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.840]   It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.520]   I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.240]   And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.840]   Your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.920]   And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.800]   they shall prophesy.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:23.200]   Now this is the characteristic of the age, after the coming of the Savior and the pouring
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.540]   out of the spirit.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.280]   The whole of worship is going to be revolutionized.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.000]   That doesn't mean that the Old Testament worship wasn't right.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   It was.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.240]   It was mainly in externals, the temple, the tabernacle, the forms, the ceremonies, the
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.840]   ritual and so on.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.720]   Now all that has come to an end and it is now spiritual worship.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:52.480]   Zechariah gets the same idea when he says that in those days God will shed forth a spirit
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.960]   of grace and of supplications.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.120]   And this is therefore the way in which the Old Testament, the whole of it, is pointing
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:07.200]   forward to the great characteristic of Christian worship.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.240]   And it is this whole element of worshipping in the spirit.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.200]   Now let me give you some statements of this.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.720]   You've got a great statement of it by the Apostle Paul in the twelfth chapter of the
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.080]   epistle to the Romans in the first verse.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:26.920]   I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:32.080]   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.600]   Now a better translation there is, present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.640]   unto God, which is your spiritual worship.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   Spiritual worship.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.560]   A worship with the mind.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.480]   A worship with the understanding.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.800]   A worship in which the spirit is involved.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   It's not mechanical.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.520]   You see he's got a picture there.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.760]   They presented the bodies of bulls and of goats and various other animals and lambs
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   in the Old Testament.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.660]   No, no, you present your own body now as a living sacrifice.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.660]   You present yourself.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:14.280]   This is spiritual worship in contrast to the external, more mechanical and localized worship
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   of the Old Testament.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.800]   Now there's one great statement of it, but come back again to Philippians 3.3.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.540]   Here is the most important statement.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.540]   The apostle Paul had to spend so much of his time and energy in arguing against those
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.600]   so-called Judaizers.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.720]   Those Jews who were trying to add on something to the gospel of Christ.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   Yes, they'd believed the gospel they said, but they were adding on circumcision and so
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.880]   on, trying to bring in bits of the law.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.600]   And Paul was always fighting this.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.080]   Finally, my brethren, he says, rejoice in the Lord.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.680]   To write the same things to you, to me indeed is grievous, but for you it is safe.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.520]   Then here it is, we, for we are the circumcision.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.560]   He says, these people want you to be circumcised, but we are the circumcision.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.200]   Who is the circumcision?
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.960]   You are Gentiles, he says, but you are the circumcision.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   Why?
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:20.920]   Well, we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.960]   You see the contrast?
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.600]   The contrast between worshipping God as the Jews wanted in the temple and by means of
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.520]   circumcision and all these things.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:38.120]   No, no, we worship God in the spirit or by the spirit and rejoice, not in the fact that
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.280]   we are Jews, not that the fact that we belong to a particular nation, not the fact that
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.000]   this is true of us and of our history and our superiority to everybody else and we go
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.160]   into the presence of God to thank him that we are Jews and so superior.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:59.880]   No, no, we don't rejoice in ourselves, we rejoice in Christ Jesus and to make it doubly
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:08.440]   certain he adds, and have no confidence in the flesh, none at all.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.320]   If any man has a right to that, says Paul, I have and that's how I once was, but I've
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:20.680]   been delivered from it, but what things were gained to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:27.640]   No confidence in the flesh and it's an essential part of the spiritual worship.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.600]   But you see you get it everywhere.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.560]   Take Paul at the end of the epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 6, verse 18.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.320]   Having told them to put on the different parts of the whole armor of God, he says, praying
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:45.000]   always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.240]   Praying you see in the spirit and nowhere is this put before us more clearly than in
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:57.080]   the little epistle to Jude, where he crams into this short space such wonderful things,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:04.880]   but ye beloved, he says, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:13.320]   Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.040]   What could be clearer than that?
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:21.040]   Praying in the spirit, praying in the Holy Ghost, or take it put on in a different way,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.240]   but meaning exactly the same thing in Romans 8, 26 and 27.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:33.280]   Likewise he says, the spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:41.920]   for as we ought, but the spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   be uttered.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:50.040]   And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit, for he maketh intercession
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.280]   according to the will of God.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.920]   Isn't that true this morning?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.560]   We know not what we should pray for as we ought.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.920]   What can you pray for in a world like this?
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.120]   What does this world deserve?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.960]   What does it deserve from God?
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.920]   Look at the way it's behaved, look at the way it is behaving, look at the way for over
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:18.080]   a century it's asserted its intelligence, its understanding, its philosophy, its science,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.600]   and ridiculed God.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.800]   Look at the state of the world, two world wars, everything we are thinking of today,
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.660]   what's happening at the present time.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.960]   What should you pray for?
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.240]   Have we a right to pray for peace?
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.400]   Do we deserve peace?
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.600]   Does the world deserve peace?
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.120]   These are the questions we ought to be asking, not in a spirit of self-congratulation, thanking
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   God for this or that.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:45.760]   No, no, we ought to be examining ourselves, have we even a right to turn to him?
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:50.880]   We know not what we should pray for as we ought.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.780]   We don't when we really stop to think.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:59.880]   But here you see is this wonderful message, the spirit himself maketh intercession for
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.840]   And thank God for this.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.840]   This is the thing that saves us, this is the thing that enables us to pray at all.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:18.240]   And you and I as Christians should be praying in the spirit, in the Holy Ghost, by the spirit,
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.000]   by the Holy Ghost.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.280]   And surely this is again the greatest lack of all amongst us.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.160]   Do we know what it means to pray in the spirit?
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.240]   What is praying?
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.440]   I ask again, is it just saying your prayers?
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.920]   Is it just turning into a building, saying a prayer, offering a prayer?
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:39.440]   Or as they put it, who think sometimes it's the hallmark of evangelicalism, let's have
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.800]   a word of prayer.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.400]   And the way in which it's said, let's have a word of prayer.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:51.080]   As if to say let's tell him so and so, let's have a word with old sir and so.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.720]   Have a word of prayer.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.400]   Beloved people, isn't it time we began to think?
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.720]   Praying in the spirit.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   What's it mean?
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.040]   Well, I can only give you one answer this morning.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:12.080]   It means initially realizing this, our utter inability and our need of the spirit.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.400]   We can't pray without him.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.720]   It is impossible.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.280]   He has been sent and has been given in order to put us right in this matter.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:27.360]   You remember how Paul again describes praying in the second chapter of the epistle to the
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:34.520]   Galatians in the 18th verse, where he talks about through him, through Christ, in other
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:40.520]   words we both have access by one spirit unto the Father.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:45.160]   The three persons of the blessed holy trinity are involved in this matter.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:51.120]   The spirit alone can get us into the right frame and condition.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:58.800]   Would you dream of going to see the Queen in Birkingham Palace without preparing yourself?
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.960]   Well how infinitely more important is it for us to prepare ourselves when we go to have
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:09.360]   audience with the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.480]   You need instruction and advice from the courtiers to make you fit to go into the presence of
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   the Queen.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.760]   There is only one who can put us into the right frame and condition and spirit to pray
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.960]   to God and that is the Holy Ghost.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.600]   And we must start by asking him to put us into the right frame and condition to deal
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.480]   with our spirits.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.920]   We need the understanding that he alone can give us so that we will know what to pray
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.000]   for as we ought.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.880]   We need his aid in the ordering of our thoughts, in the use of words and speech and all these
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.880]   things.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.240]   This is the beginning of praying in the spirit.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:57.760]   The realization that I can't pray, that perhaps I've never prayed at all and that
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:04.120]   it is only as the spirit leads me, guides me, instructs me and shows me the way and
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.720]   prepares me that I can pray at all.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:18.280]   So I begin to worship and to pray, relying utterly and absolutely upon the power of the
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   Holy Spirit.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.040]   That is the beginning of praying in the spirit.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:28.760]   God willing, we'll go on to consider further aspects of this matter and how we may know
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:34.640]   whether we have ever prayed in the spirit or not next Sunday morning.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.560]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
