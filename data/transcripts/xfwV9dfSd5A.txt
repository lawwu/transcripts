[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.400]   We begin the week with a question from Zach, a listener to the podcast who writes in to
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.520]   ask about prayer.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.520]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.800]   Thanks for being such a great resource and answering hard questions in this podcast.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800]   My question for you is this.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.760]   In your own words and in your own application, what does it mean to pray without ceasing?"
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.760]   Well, let's get the text in front of us with a little bit of context, I think, because
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.160]   that really has significant things to say about the little phrase.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.440]   So here's 1 Thessalonians 5, and we'll do maybe verses 15 to 18.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.600]   "See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always," note that word, "always seek
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.880]   to do good to one another and to everyone."
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:03.920]   Now start here with verse 15, just so that we can see that Paul's burden is not just
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.440]   a kind of private piety when he comes to speak of prayer.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.760]   This is a radical call to counterintuitive, countercultural love.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.240]   Don't repay people evil for evil.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.760]   Do good to everyone always.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.720]   Next verse, "Rejoice always," which is not the kind of emotional response one would ordinarily
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.640]   have to being mistreated and treating others better than we are treated.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.720]   You might be wounded, you might be spurned, you might be in jail if people have treated
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.900]   you badly.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.840]   So this is a really amazing way of life in Paul's mind, a miraculous one, being treated
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.200]   badly, returning good for evil, and all the while rejoicing always.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.440]   Always doing good to those who do bad to you, always rejoicing.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.280]   This is incredible.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.840]   And then comes the phrase that Zach was asking about, and it makes sense now a little more,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.600]   "Pray without ceasing."
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.720]   If that life sounds hard to you, pray without ceasing.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.040]   And then he gives a specific example of the kind of prayer in verse 18.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.000]   Not just, "Help, Lord," which of course we would pray, "Help all the time.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.080]   I need help to live this way."
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:33.800]   But he goes on and says, "Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.600]   in Christ Jesus for you."
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.840]   So let's keep in mind two things about the context.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.200]   One is the everys and the alls.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.880]   One, do good always to everyone.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.200]   Two, rejoice always.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.880]   Three, pray always or without ceasing.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.520]   Four, give thanks always or in every circumstance.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.560]   The other contextual observation is that there seems to be a deepening to the question, "How?"
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.960]   How to live?
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.640]   Answer, do good always to everyone.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.880]   Even when they don't do good to you.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   How?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.640]   Rejoice always.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.480]   Find your joy in something other than the way you're treated.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   How?
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   Pray without ceasing.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   How?
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.280]   Be in a continual disposition of thankfulness to God.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.640]   So in those contexts, what does pray without ceasing then mean?
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.160]   That's what Zach asked.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   And I see at least three things here that it means.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.280]   First, it means that there's, I think, a spirit of dependence, a spirit of dependence that
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.400]   should permeate all we do.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.560]   This is the very spirit and essence of prayer, dependence.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.080]   So even when we are not speaking consciously, consciously to God, there's a deep abiding
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.520]   dependence on Him that is woven into the very essence of our faith.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.860]   In that sense, we are praying.
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:23.120]   We are experiencing a spirit of dependence continuously, and that kind of disposition
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.040]   is I think right at the heart of what God creates when He creates a Christian.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.680]   That's the spirit meaning that it has, and I think this is probably the one that's foremost
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.400]   in Paul's conscious intention here.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.800]   Praying without ceasing means praying repeatedly and often, repeatedly and often.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:51.880]   And I base that on the way he used the word adielaptos, unceasing, in Romans 1.9.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.340]   Listen how he uses it here.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.780]   So same word without ceasing.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.020]   He says, "For God whom I serve in my spirit, in the preaching of the gospel and of His
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.740]   Son is my witness as to how I, adielaptos, without ceasing, unceasingly, make mention
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.980]   of you."
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:19.620]   Now we can be sure, can't we, that Paul did not make mention of the Romans in every minute
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.660]   or second of his prayers or his days or his preaching.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.140]   He prayed and he spoke about lots of other things besides the Romans, but he mentioned
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.420]   them over and over.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.860]   He mentioned them often.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.940]   He mentioned them regularly.
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.780]   So he says, "I mentioned you without ceasing."
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.500]   It doesn't mean that he was verbally and mentally always, every second, mentioning
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.020]   them.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.700]   It means that over and over, always, repeatedly, without fail, when I get on my knees, you're
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.220]   in my prayer.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.500]   That's basically what I think he means by without ceasing, repeatedly and often.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.100]   And the third thing I think he means is not giving up on prayer.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.940]   Without ceasing means don't ever come to a point in your life where you say, "Prayer
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.940]   doesn't work.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.940]   I'm done.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.940]   I'm giving up on God.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.940]   I'm giving up on prayer.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.940]   I'm giving up on God."
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.820]   That would be the very opposite of without ceasing.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.100]   It means don't ever do that.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.420]   Don't ever get to that point.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:36.220]   So the key to rejoicing always is to pray continually, that is to lean on God all the
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.980]   time and call to him repeatedly and often.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.820]   Never give up looking to him for help and come to him repeatedly during the day and
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.300]   come often.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:57.020]   Make the default state of your mind a Godward longing and a Godward thankfulness.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.260]   And one last thing maybe it would be helpful to say.
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:09.780]   I think it's important to notice that in real life, some discipline in regular times of
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:18.820]   prayer during the day keep this kind of without ceasing prayer alive.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.780]   I know a lot of people, I don't know a lot of people, but I've heard enough people say
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.220]   that they want to pray spontaneously.
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.820]   They want to be always in a spirit of prayer.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.300]   They don't need set times of prayer.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.300]   That's legalistic.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.220]   I think that's ridiculous.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:40.340]   I think it's unbiblical, and I think it's unrealistic if they just knew themselves,
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:48.540]   because it's disciplined regular times of prayer that fit us for the kind of spirit
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:54.500]   that enables us to enjoy the hour-by-hour spontaneous walk with God.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:00.940]   And Daniel, good old Daniel in the Old Testament, is a great example of this, because we know
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:08.140]   that Daniel in critical crisis moments of his life offered up quick prayers to God,
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.340]   "Oh God, help me.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.780]   I'm being asked something here that I don't have an answer for."
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.660]   And where did that come from?
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.780]   Well, Daniel 6.10 says, "Now when Daniel knew that the decree," namely that nobody can pray
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:29.780]   except to the king, "When Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered his house."
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:36.860]   Now in his roof chamber, he had windows toward Jerusalem, and he continued kneeling on his
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.780]   knees three times a day—continued, that was his pattern.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:49.060]   He continued his pattern of disciplined three times a day prayer, praying and giving thanks
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.940]   before his God as he had been previously doing.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:01.700]   So the point is that Daniel lived a life that combined discipline three times a day with
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:09.020]   spontaneous encounters with God, and I think that's the way it should be with us.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:16.080]   If we hope to pray without ceasing day and night in the way Paul calls us to, enjoying
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.060]   that kind of continual communion with God and that repeated coming to him, we're going
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.860]   to need to develop disciplined times of prayer as well.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.220]   Yeah, yes, we will.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.260]   May God grant us all the discipline and faith of Daniel in our prayer lives.
