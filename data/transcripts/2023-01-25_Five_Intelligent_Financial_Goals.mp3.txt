[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.880]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.680]   My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.860]   Today, I want to share with you some good and useful and productive financial goals
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.160]   that you can establish for the new year.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.460]   Now, clearly, recording and releasing this on Wednesday, January 25, 2023, I'm a little bit late.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.600]   Thank you for your patience. My wife and I have been a little busy
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.280]   welcoming our fifth child to our household.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   Thankfully, we want you to rejoice with us.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.040]   Thankfully, very happy to report that childbirth went well.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.980]   Mom and baby are doing well. Everyone's doing perfectly.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.120]   And settling into our new, larger, expanded family, and everything is going swimmingly.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.260]   So we're doing really well, but obviously, it's a very important time.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.500]   And so I've been off the microphone to be caring for my wife and our children, etc.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.840]   And so forgive me for being just a little bit late.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.500]   But in some ways, and by the way, I was often when we have a baby,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.380]   I come back and I do a podcast about something related to childbirth.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.380]   And I actually spent the last hour sitting here working on one,
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.720]   but I couldn't, not childbirth, but having children, I couldn't get the tone right.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.820]   So I'm canning that episode and doing this episode instead.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.160]   Anyway, it could turn out to be a good thing that I'm creating this podcast
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.660]   about intelligent goals for the new year, because this is a good time to be thinking about it.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.200]   Yes, maybe it would have been better if it were before January 1.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   But here are some things that I want to give you these ideas,
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.600]   because these are intelligent goals to do anytime.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.100]   And there's some things that now that we're well in the swing of the new year,
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.980]   the holiday season is behind us.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.340]   This is prime work time. Middle to end of January, February, March.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.680]   This is just the best work time.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   There's no hassle. You're focused, you're motivated, you're clear on what you're doing,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.280]   and this is a good time to work.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.460]   So I want to give you some good and useful goals for you to consider.
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:33.740]   Perspective goal number one, build an intelligent, workable, useful financial tracking system.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.000]   Now, this one I wish I had gotten to you before, but again, it's fine.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.940]   I'm glad to get it to you now.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.980]   All of us need some kind of intelligent, workable financial tracking system.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.380]   You need to know how much you're making, how much you're spending, and what you're spending it on.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:02.600]   The system that is right for you is going to be different than the system that is right for me.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.100]   More importantly, the system that is right for you today is going to be different
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.300]   than the system that was right for you five or ten years ago.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.340]   And the system that is right for you today is going to be different
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.020]   than the system that is right for you five or ten years from now.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.180]   I've recorded many podcasts about budgeting, budgeting systems, etc.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.020]   This is an area in which I think people labor under the delusion that there is a right way to do it.
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.220]   They think, "I have to budget every cent of my money, every penny of my money.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.700]   I need to know where every dollar goes."
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.780]   No, you don't.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:50.740]   But you must have some kind of intelligent system if you're going to win with money.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.980]   That intelligent system will look different based upon the circumstances of your life,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.940]   where you are financially, and what you're doing.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:09.780]   If you're a hard-working single dad raising three children on $3,000 a month,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.140]   you're going to need a budgeting system that accounts for every dollar.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:23.620]   If you're a hard-working man who is paying off his debt and has a goal of paying off $150,000
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.420]   of student loan debt this year on your $200,000 income,
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.140]   you're going to need a hard-working budgeting system that accounts for most of your dollars.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:40.620]   If you're a well-paid executive earning $350,000 a year,
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.980]   and you don't have any debt except your mortgage, everything is in good shape, etc.,
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.860]   you don't need a budgeting system that's going to track every dollar.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.860]   But you do need to have a system that tells you where you are financially.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:07.380]   Business owners and entrepreneurs go bust when they don't track their company's performance.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:15.220]   Individuals go bust when they don't track the performance of their individual financial enterprise.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.780]   And so you need to have a system that works for you.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:27.620]   So I want you to take a moment and ask yourself, "How well is my current system working for me?"
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.140]   Here are some ideas to help you judge it.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.260]   Number one, if I'm talking to Joshua Sheets, my financial advisor,
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.420]   and Joshua Sheets asks me, "How much money do you spend?"
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.820]   Can I give him an answer?
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.380]   Can I give him an answer very, very quickly?
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.020]   By the way, it's fine with me if you need to open an app or check a spreadsheet or check something,
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.060]   but you need to have some kind of answer.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.100]   How much money do I spend?
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.220]   Well, I spend $10,000 a month.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.340]   I spend $18,000 a month, or I spend $150,000 a year.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.580]   Whatever the number is, you need to have an answer.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.780]   Here's about how much money I spend.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.700]   That's a good thing to know.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.980]   You also need to know how much money you make, etc.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.620]   So you need to have some system that's going to tell you this data quickly and easily.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.340]   This is easy for employees, right?
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.420]   You know your top-line salary number.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.100]   If you have an idea of what your bills are, etc., you can have the number,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.860]   but you need a system that's going to tell you how much you spend.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.180]   Here's another question to analyze your current tracking system.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.180]   Do I know if I'm on track to reach my goals?
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.180]   Is this system helping me to be on track to reach my goals?
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.460]   Am I confident that I'm on track to reach my goals?
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.500]   The reason we track money is so that we can know if we're on track,
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.900]   on course, towards our goals.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.460]   The reason people all of a sudden start budgeting when they want to get out of debt
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.740]   is so that they can get out of debt.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.940]   They set a goal, and you need a new system to know whether you're going to achieve that goal.
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.300]   And so your financial tracking system should tell you
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.220]   whether you are on track to reach your goals.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.780]   Now, how you do this is up to you.
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.740]   There are many good apps that can help you.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.180]   I'm not sure that you need a standalone app in many cases.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.780]   First, let's talk about your income.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.380]   If you are a wage earner, you probably have a fairly standard, consistent income.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.220]   That's good enough.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.340]   If you can just put down your top line W-2 income,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.500]   that tells you how much money you make, great.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.420]   If you're a business owner,
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.980]   you should be able to get your income from your bookkeeping system.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.300]   If you don't have a bookkeeping system that's effective,
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.300]   that's a good sign that you're not doing as well with your business and management
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.700]   as you should be.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.980]   If you're being coached as an entrepreneur,
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.180]   and your coach comes in and assesses your bookkeeping system
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.980]   and finds out that you don't have a dashboard of reports
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.180]   that's going to tell you on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly basis
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.020]   what your profit and loss is, how things are trending, etc.,
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.140]   your coach is going to tell you to fix that.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.660]   So if you can't tell me how much money you're making, fix it.
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.460]   Find some kind of system that's going to work for you to fix it
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.460]   so you know how much money you're making.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.980]   On expenses, a detailed spreadsheet of expenses
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.180]   can be helpful for some people, especially if you enjoy that.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.460]   But for many of us, it's not necessary.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.700]   What you want to think about is a system that allows you to control
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.140]   your expenses adequately.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.540]   So you've heard of pay yourself first.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.140]   The reason pay yourself first is so powerful,
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.580]   is it allows you to spend freely
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.420]   knowing that you've saved and invested.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.700]   In a moment, I'll talk about setting a goal of maxing out your retirement accounts.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.500]   It's a wonderful goal to set. It's a great goal to set.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.100]   Here's what's especially great about it.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.500]   If you earn wages and up front,
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.580]   you divert those wages into your retirement account,
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.620]   and if you're convinced that that's enough money for you,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.580]   you don't need any more money for that,
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.380]   and all of the balance of your wages goes into your checking account,
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.980]   then you can just spend all the money that's in your checking account
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.940]   and you're in good shape.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.900]   If you just set it up so that all your bills are paid on the same day
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.380]   that your paycheck hits your checking account,
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.580]   and you want to know if you can afford to buy something,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.260]   you just pull out your phone, see what the balance is in your checking account,
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.340]   and either swipe your debit card or not swipe your debit card.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.820]   That's a bulletproof system. It's a wonderful system.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.580]   It's going to give you an appropriate dashboard
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.140]   as to whether or not you can afford to spend money.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.940]   Notice in what I've described, you're not using credit cards,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.780]   you're not going into debt, you're saving money first
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.460]   by simply putting it into your retirement account,
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.980]   and then you are just spending money that's in your checking account,
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.900]   and if the money's there, you can spend it. If not, you can't.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.940]   So that works really, really well.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.980]   Now, the cool thing is most of our banks now can produce for you,
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.900]   just like our credit cards have been able to do for years,
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.980]   they can produce for you an end-of-year statement.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.540]   Here at the end of January, with most of your major credit card issuers,
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.260]   you should be able to access your end-of-the-year spending breakdown.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.940]   And a great way to track your money is just to use this.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:42.340]   If you have one card that you spend all your money on, one credit card,
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.460]   and you just always swipe that card at the end of the year,
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.660]   now you can pull open that summary and you can see it there.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.340]   Again, many banks will do this, many credit cards will do this,
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.420]   and you can get an idea of what you spend your money on.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.260]   That works really, really well.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.580]   And as long as there aren't many other systems that cause you problems,
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.820]   meaning as long as you're not spending on too many accounts,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.500]   or as long as you don't have too many transactions that aren't recognized there,
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.620]   then I think this is a great system.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:16.260]   In conclusion, goal number one is simply assess, or establish,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.140]   or restructure your financial tracking system
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:26.500]   so that you can have accurate information about your expenses over the next year.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.220]   Even if you just create the system, having it there as a dashboard
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:37.300]   will automatically start to move you into a better territory with your money.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.180]   Pivot now to goal number two.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.220]   What's goal number two?
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:49.980]   Well, goal number two is analyze your data and see if you are on track for your goals.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.660]   Every person should sit down at least once a year
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.540]   and assess whether or not you are on track towards your financial goals.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.420]   Again, the way that you did this 10 years ago
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.140]   is different than how you should do it today
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.060]   and is different than how you will do it 10 years from now.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.100]   10 years ago, you may have been just getting started
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.380]   and you're sitting down and you're crunching every category.
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.500]   Today, you may be much more comfortable
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.820]   and you just need to make a broad overview and make sure you're on track.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.420]   10 years from now, you may be mega wealthy
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.820]   and so your goal setting is going to be different,
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:30.660]   but you need to analyze how you're doing and whether or not you are on track.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.980]   Now, the best tool of analysis that I know of is what I created,
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.180]   the Radical Personal Finance Framework for Wealth.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.860]   Number one is increase income.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.540]   Two is decrease expenses.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.020]   Three is invest wisely.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.500]   Four is optimize lifestyle.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.220]   Excuse me, four is avoid catastrophe and five is optimize lifestyle.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.340]   Here are your five ideas.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.260]   And the way I do this and the way I encourage people to do this
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.020]   is to sit down and just ask yourself,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.100]   "Where am I weakest right now?
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.580]   Is my income weak?
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.700]   Is my spending weak?
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.740]   Is my investing weak?"
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.260]   Et cetera.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.300]   "Where am I weakest right now?"
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.420]   For most people, income is your biggest opportunity.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.020]   So spend some time analyzing how you can increase your income.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.300]   Maybe that means you go through your company's compensation package
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.940]   and make sure you really, really understand it and ask yourself,
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.540]   "Are there any bonuses that I'm missing out on?"
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.180]   For example, "Can I increase my income if I get a master's degree?
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:33.460]   Could I increase my income if I could lower the complaint reporting
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.780]   on our company's product or if I improve the efficiency by 5%?
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.220]   Could I earn a bonus?
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.340]   Or is there a career change I could start making a plan for?"
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.900]   Et cetera.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.860]   Now, I've talked a lot about income.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.780]   So I'm going to skip quickly to now expenses.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.340]   With expenses, one of the reasons you need a tracking system
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:56.460]   is so that you can look at your expense categories on a category basis.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.300]   So what I encourage you to do is you take your tracking system,
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.820]   you export the categories and put them all on a sheet
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.460]   and you order them from biggest category to littlest category.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.780]   And then ask yourself, looking at each category,
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.460]   starting with the biggest number, "Is there a way I can reduce this?"
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.100]   My favorite question is this, "Can I cut this category by 50%
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.580]   and double my satisfaction with it?"
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:24.820]   So for most of us, the single biggest category is tax, income tax.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.180]   The biggest expense in our lives is income tax or employment tax.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.300]   So ask yourself, "Is there a way I can reduce this expense by 50%
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.260]   and increase my satisfaction?"
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.100]   And this is where you get into tax planning.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.500]   And so simple things like, "This is the year I'm going to set up an S corporation
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.860]   in order to reduce my self-employment tax."
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.580]   Or, "This is the year I'm going to move from one side of town,
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.780]   which is in the high-tax state, to the other side of town,
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.820]   that's in the low-tax state."
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.020]   Or, "This is the year I'm going to change and move to a tax haven."
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.260]   Or, "This is the year I'm going to start the side business
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.140]   and use the-- I'm going to convert my hobbies into a side business
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:04.540]   and use those side business expenses to offset the losses on my primary income."
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.620]   Or, "This is the year I'm going to start tracking my mileage more diligently
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.420]   or tracking my business meals more diligently."
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.540]   And you go through it, you know, all the stuff.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.660]   Taxes, unfortunately, generally involves a lot of little things
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.140]   that when added up can often be a good bit of savings.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.740]   There's no one thing that you can generally apply except often moving.
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.140]   And most people aren't going to move and shouldn't move
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.620]   because tax planning should not be your primary lifestyle driving goal.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.660]   But you look at taxes.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.060]   Then for many people, what next question is housing?
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.980]   "Well, am I happy with the money I'm spending on housing?" Et cetera.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.420]   And go through each category and just ask yourself,
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:46.220]   "Am I satisfied with this or can I get more benefit from this category?"
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.060]   Not all categories should go down.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.660]   The goal is not to always live in a cheaper house.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.740]   The goal is not to always live in a cheaper tax situation.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.500]   The goal is to maximize each category and be really confident
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.420]   that you're doing what is right for you.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.540]   Now, on the investment perspective,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.340]   we do talk quite a lot here at Radical Personal Finance about investing.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.900]   And with investing, it's important that you recognize
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.900]   that your stages of life that you go through as an investor vary a lot.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.980]   And there are different investments that are really, really smart at different times.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:23.700]   So when you're very young, investing in education and credentialization
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.980]   is often your very best investment.
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.340]   Sometimes as you start to get into the workforce,
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.940]   especially if you have some control over a business,
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.420]   investing in marketing is your best investment.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.180]   Investing in growing your brand and growing your customer base
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.860]   is your best investment.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.540]   As you start to acquire money and capital,
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:48.180]   now your best investment comes from optimizing your investment returns.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.980]   And if you got $1,000 in the bank
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.220]   and you can get a 20% rate of return on your money with some great investment,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.060]   oh, big deal, you've made $200.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.500]   On the other hand, if you got a million dollars in the bank,
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.700]   going from a 10% rate of return to a 20% rate of return
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.660]   would make a huge difference in your experience.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.300]   And so as you get older and your capital grows,
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.740]   now you need to give more and more time and more and more attention to investing.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.180]   You can't do the same thing all throughout your life.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.260]   When you're 25, ignore investing.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.780]   Focus on earning and keeping expenses low.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.900]   When you're 55, earning and low expenses are not nearly as important
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.500]   as the rate of return that you make on your capital.
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.340]   Avoid catastrophe.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.340]   Go through all the list of things that you can,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.900]   the bad things that could happen to you.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.300]   Review your coverages, right?
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.500]   Sit down with your property and casualty agent
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.620]   and make that your February goal.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.620]   Let's review all my property and casualty coverages.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.580]   In March, sit with your life insurance agent.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.540]   Let's review my life insurance coverages.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.220]   Ah, sorry.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.020]   This is the perfect spot for my ad.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.020]   In February, we all know what you're going to be doing.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.900]   You're going to be taking the course that we're doing called Hack Proof.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.980]   So let me just take a moment and do my ad.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.980]   Gabriel Custodio and I have teamed up before for our Bitcoin course,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.100]   which by the way, you can buy at bitcoinprivacycourse.com.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.020]   But as we were talking about areas where we think there's a shortage of good information,
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.980]   where we can add good value,
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.500]   we decided to focus on this topic of Hack Proof,
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.620]   how to beat fraudsters, prevent identity theft, and say goodbye to cybercrime.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.980]   Because, and this fits perfectly here as I talk about avoiding catastrophe,
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.780]   because one of the best things you can do to avoid catastrophe
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.260]   is eliminate your identity theft risk.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.380]   So make this your February project.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.220]   You're going to take our course in February.
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.900]   It's going to be a two-part live class where we talk about all the things that you can do
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.540]   to basically button down your document and your financial situation
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.340]   so that you can prevent identity theft and become hack proof
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.860]   and eliminate the huge risk of cybercrime.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.100]   As we talked about in the standalone episode that we did with an ad for the show,
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.620]   it's a huge industry and it's a huge risk.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.700]   And this is one of those things that a few simple things done in advance can protect you.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:02.300]   So sign up today, go to hackproofcourse.com and sign up today, hackproofcourse.com.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:07.140]   Now after the course, then in April, sit with a bankruptcy attorney
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.340]   and do pre-bankruptcy planning as part of your asset protection planning.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.580]   In May, talk to a marriage counselor
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.580]   and ask him how you can bulletproof your marriage
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.020]   so that you don't wind up in divorce course.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:24.340]   In June, take a seminar on child raising and how to keep your kid off drugs.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.940]   In July, take July off and take your kids to the mountains.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.020]   Just go through and ask yourself all the catastrophes that could happen, right?
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.460]   Maybe July, buy prepping items or something.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.100]   Go through and think regularly, how can I avoid catastrophe?
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.740]   What are the hazards that could face me?
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:46.260]   And then optimize lifestyle, regularly getting in touch with your vision for the future,
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.980]   your plans and your dreams for your life one year from now,
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.100]   five years from now, ten years from now,
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.860]   and making sure that you're optimizing how you earn your income,
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.660]   how you spend your money, how you invest your money, etc.,
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:01.580]   how you live your family life, etc., and thinking those things through.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.540]   So goal number two is just analyze your data, look at it.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.060]   You often, one of the reasons I try to give so many ideas
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.380]   is just to inspire you to think creatively.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.380]   At the end of the day, at some point, you got to pull out your own numbers,
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.300]   look at them and analyze them and find opportunities for improving.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.380]   And if you do that aggressively, you'll find that your life can change very, very quickly.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:31.220]   Goal number three that I want you to consider making for this year is very simple.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.620]   Pay off all non-mortgage debt.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.260]   Pay off all non-mortgage debt.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.740]   Some cases, some people want to consider paying off mortgages too,
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.220]   but at the very least, pay off all non-mortgage debt.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.220]   Why do I say this as a potential goal?
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.660]   It's quite simply this.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:58.060]   In my years of financial planning, I have observed that persons who live their life free of debt
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:06.340]   are able to adapt and respond, react quickly and easily to the changing desires that they have.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.740]   And they're not burdened by the commitments and mistakes of the past.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.380]   Folks who use debt never get to respond and pivot to how they want to live today
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.660]   because they're often beholden to the past.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.540]   They're tied to their past decisions.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.220]   So just simply getting free of all non-mortgage debt
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.940]   and making a goal to pay off all non-mortgage debt
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.100]   can be one of the most rewarding things that you can do.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.620]   And it's a wonderful financial goal for you to set.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:41.940]   In most cases, you can accomplish this in less than a year.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.340]   The reason I'm confident in that assertion is very simple.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.060]   You're generally not going to be lent more money
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.500]   under the kind of American system of credit scores, etc.,
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.580]   than what you could pay off in a year of focused effort.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.300]   Most people, you have to go through financial underwriting when you borrow money.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.020]   And if you sit down and you decide, "I'm going to get out of debt.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.780]   I'm going to pay off all my non-mortgage debt."
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.580]   You can sit down and you can get that done in less than a year in most cases.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.820]   Maybe for some it's a year and a half, but probably maximum 18 months.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.580]   So set a goal. Get debt-free.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:29.620]   I want you to imagine how simple and productive your life would be if you had no debt.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.980]   How simple, how stress-free your life would be if you had no debt.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.820]   Remember that example I said earlier about making sure that
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.460]   if the guy who just saves money in his retirement accounts
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.460]   then spends all the rest of his money,
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.980]   you can do that when you're debt-free
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.620]   because you don't have to worry about paying anybody else off.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.060]   So at some point in time, set a goal and say, "I'm going to get out of debt."
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.100]   And make it this year.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.740]   If you have non-mortgage debt, make it this year that I'm going to get out of debt.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.220]   Just pay off all of your non-mortgage debt.
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.260]   If you can't do it easily in a year,
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.300]   then do the things that are necessary for you to accomplish it.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.940]   So most of my listening audience can just decide to do it,
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.380]   start putting extra money at it and get after it.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.860]   Some people need to sell a car,
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.540]   some people need to sell a badly performing investment,
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.180]   some people need to get rid of some stuff.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:30.060]   But just set a goal of this year being free of all debt
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.820]   and then resolve not to go into debt again in the future
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.700]   because then you'll be free.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.460]   Every year you'll be free.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.540]   Debt-free is awesome.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:46.140]   Debt-free is awesome.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.660]   Make this be the year that you set a goal
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:55.100]   of getting rid of all of your non-mortgage debt
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.420]   and make it happen
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.420]   so that for the rest of your life you can live financially free,
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.540]   knowing that if you wanted to spend all of your money,
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.180]   you could responsibly do that
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.980]   because at least you're not beholden to the mistakes of the past
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.180]   or the overspending of the past, which is what debt is.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:16.300]   Quick comment on my distinction of non-mortgage debt versus mortgage debt.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.180]   I think for many people, paying off mortgage debt is a smart idea.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.340]   But mortgage debt can always be paid off by the sale of an asset.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.140]   And so it doesn't cause you the same degree of lack of freedom
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.900]   as non-mortgage debt.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.580]   If you're living in Nashville, Tennessee,
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.380]   and you have a $400,000 mortgage on an $800,000 house
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.420]   and you decide you want to sell and move,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.340]   you can sell the house, pay off the mortgage and move.
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.660]   That's different than if you're living in Nashville, Tennessee,
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.580]   and you've got $80,000 of credit card debt.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.140]   That's harder to deal with.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.740]   So that's why I make the distinction between mortgage debt and non-mortgage debt
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.500]   is when you have debt backed by an asset,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.660]   then anytime you want to get rid of the debt, you could just sell the asset.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.020]   And so that is an option.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.740]   It doesn't keep you as tied down as non-mortgage debt.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.460]   Now for a limited time at Delamo Motorsports.

[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.300]   Goal number four I want you to set for 2023 is this.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:50.020]   I want you to fully fund all available retirement accounts.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:55.220]   I repeat, I want you to fully fund, also known as max out,
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.860]   all available retirement accounts.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.180]   I want you to set that as your goal and I want you to accomplish it
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.100]   regardless of the effort of what it takes you to accomplish it.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:15.620]   I want you to max out every one of your retirement accounts this year in the year 2023.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.820]   Let me explain why this is so important.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:26.660]   If you only do this, this one thing of maxing out all available retirement accounts,
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.940]   if you only do this in virtually all circumstances,
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:39.820]   you will be set for your long-term wealth accumulation needs.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:51.940]   The 2023 401k contribution limit in the United States of America is $22,500 for 2023.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.020]   When you start running a financial calculator,
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:59.340]   let's just assume you're say 35 years old and let's assume we've got 30 years to invest.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.380]   Let's assume you make 7%. We start with no money.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:07.500]   Let's just pretend we start with no money and we just put in $22,500 per year.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.180]   By the way, I'm putting this in as level, no inflation adjustment, etc.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.020]   At 65 years old, you would have $2 million.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.300]   $2 million. That is a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.140]   Now, it would actually be higher because if you maxed out your 401k,
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.380]   in most cases, you would have an employer match.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:32.740]   So your total contribution would probably be more like something like $28,000 or $30,000 or more.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:36.820]   And every year, this contribution limit is going to adjust.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.940]   And so you're going to set a goal every year of maxing
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.740]   based upon that current calendar year contribution limit.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.140]   And oh, by the way, when you get to the catch-up contributions,
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.620]   now you get an extra, was it $6,500 that you can contribute.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.780]   So now you're up to almost $30,000 going in.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.140]   So you can have more and more and more.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.380]   Even if you start late, right?
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.700]   Let's say that you are 50 years old and you have nothing saved for retirement.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.700]   Well, guess what? My answer is still going to be the same.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.300]   Just set a goal of maxing out your retirement accounts.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.740]   Because if you start late and you have nothing saved and you start saving at age 50,
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.100]   you're not going to retire at age 65.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.660]   You're going to retire at 70 or 75, something longer.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.500]   But you'll get there very quickly by saving.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.980]   And now you get the opportunity to do so-called catch-up contributions, right?
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.540]   You have a larger contribution limit.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.780]   Now, what if you also have access to something like a Roth IRA
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.060]   or a spousal traditional IRA or something like that?
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.780]   Well, now you have even more.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:42.700]   So set yourself a goal of maxing out every available retirement account.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.140]   Set that as a goal.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.220]   And then make it happen.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.100]   In order to make it happen, you might need to increase your income.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.300]   In order to make it happen, you might need to decrease your expenses.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.580]   But make it happen and do it every year.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.220]   If that were all the money you saved
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.020]   and that were the only thing you did for wealth building,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:10.620]   if you just do that, you will be on track to be very rich in the fullness of time.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.020]   It's such a clear, simple, tangible goal.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.980]   Set it as a goal and make it happen.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:24.140]   Set a goal to max out every retirement account that is available to you.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.900]   I want to emphasize again, these things scale to size, right?
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.340]   Let's say that you have a dual income family.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.660]   Well, you might have two 401ks.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   You may be able to put money in two Roth IRAs.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:44.340]   That would be $55,000-ish going into retirement accounts.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.700]   You can save more.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.900]   Maybe you have a single income family.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.900]   Well, guess what?
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.380]   You max out one 401k or you max out one
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.420]   and then you do one traditional IRA for your spouse.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.980]   What if you don't have access to a 401k?
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.020]   Well, usually, the reason you don't have access to a 401k
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.340]   is usually because you work in an industry
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.620]   where you have a lower earning threshold.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.300]   So maybe you have an account you could put in $5,000
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.660]   or all you can do is do Roth IRAs.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.500]   Whatever is available to you, do what you can do.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.980]   Max out all available retirement accounts.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.020]   Set that as a goal and make it happen.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:29.220]   And if that were the only thing you do for your long-term wealth production,
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.700]   it's good enough.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.820]   You don't need to save any more money.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.980]   Let me extol the virtues of these accounts for just a moment.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.940]   Number one, these accounts are very tax efficient.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:44.700]   Having the ability to put money into an account pre-tax is incredible.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.300]   For a wage earner, it is the thing you can do to lower your taxes.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.380]   So maximize it.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:56.180]   More importantly, these accounts have great investment options,
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.660]   wonderful investment options.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.780]   It's so easy to go to Vanguard or Fidelity or T. Rowe Price
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.020]   or really almost anywhere and just open an account.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.300]   If you have a 401k, undoubtedly you've got great investment options.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.420]   The market is so competitive that it's hard to find an account
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.780]   that doesn't have good options in it now.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.580]   And mutual funds that are locked up in a 401k where you can't touch them
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.740]   are some of the best managed mutual funds out there
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.820]   because you're not tempted to buy and sell
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.460]   and you're not tempted to tie in the market.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.340]   It can just sit there and grow as the economy grows over time.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.940]   In addition, these accounts are completely protected
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.580]   from the claims of creditors with a few variations depending on states,
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.620]   depending on if you're talking about IRAs, 401ks, etc.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.620]   But money that's in your 401k or in your pension plan is just golden.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:47.100]   It is protected from all but the super creditors of IRS or divorcing spouse.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.700]   It is protected so it's really solid or really, really safe.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.980]   So max out all available retirement accounts.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.220]   Set that as a goal.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.260]   If you have to rejigger your budget to make it happen,
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.420]   well, that's why we have the data.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.380]   That was goal number one.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.100]   Collect the data.
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.220]   Goal number two is analyze it, right?
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.340]   Rejigger your data, rejigger your expenses, change something,
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:11.100]   move to a cheaper house, drive a cheaper car, something.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.020]   Just set it as a non-negotiable.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:18.700]   I'm the guy who maxes out my retirement accounts every year and do it.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.020]   Goal number five.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.220]   Goal number five is this.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:29.540]   I want you to set a goal to increase your income by 20%.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.420]   Increase your income by 20%.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.060]   There's nothing magical about my 20% number.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.300]   In thinking about it, I just chose this and I'll explain why I chose it.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.940]   But if you have a slightly different number, that's fine.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.420]   The key thing is I want you to be focused on increasing your income.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.780]   But I think 20% is a useful way of thinking.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.900]   As you know, I often use larger numbers.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:57.460]   I talk about doubling your income, tripling your income, 10x-ing your income.
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:04.380]   I think those ways of thinking are really powerful because you can't just do more
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.780]   and 5x your income or 10x your income.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.180]   You have to transform.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.780]   You have to redesign.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.700]   And sometimes that's easier.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:17.060]   But I also know there's a significant portion of my listening audience that
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.540]   is a little overwhelmed by thinking of how do I triple my income.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.500]   You can't triple your income at a job.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   It's not going to happen.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.500]   You're going to have to get a different job or retrain for another job
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.260]   in your company, et cetera.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.820]   You can't do it.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.300]   But that doesn't mean you have to just sit back and just accept a cost of living
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.500]   raise.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.420]   Remember, with high inflation, your wages need to be keeping up with inflation
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.740]   significantly.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.100]   So let's say 7%, 10%, depending on the inflation rate where you live.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.900]   So you need at least to keep up with inflation if at all possible.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:54.060]   But set a goal of a 20% increase and then ask yourself, how can I be worth a 20%
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.780]   increase in pay?
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:01.340]   20% is feasible, I think, for many people, especially when you look at it over the
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.620]   course of a year, a one-year project.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.100]   How can I produce more?
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.180]   How can I make my company more money?
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.580]   How can I connect more?
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.980]   How can I shore up my weaknesses and really enhance my strengths?
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:20.300]   Set yourself a goal of increasing your income by 20% and then brainstorm how you
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:25.100]   can do it in your specific opportunity.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:30.220]   Increasing your income is not always feasible.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.140]   It's not always even the right move.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.500]   Frequently, I'll work with private consulting clients and I'll say, "You shouldn't be
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.860]   worried about increasing your income.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.140]   It's not there right now."
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:49.180]   So it's not always the right move, but it is almost always the right thing to focus
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.240]   on in financial planning first and foremost.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.660]   So many people in financial planning live in a world of scarcity.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.860]   I have to budget more.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   I have to save more, etc.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.860]   That's fine.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.220]   It's good.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:07.420]   But the secret path to having a richer and more enjoyable life now while also building
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:12.500]   your plan for financial freedom faster is increasing your income.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.220]   That's where you have the best of both worlds.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:20.460]   If you could increase your income by 20%, you could save half, spend half, wind up getting
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.900]   richer faster while also living better now.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.900]   And you can do it again.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.900]   And you can do it again.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.180]   And you can do it again.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:34.980]   And recognize if you increase your income by 20%, you'll have doubled your income very,
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.380]   very quickly.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:43.060]   If you increase your income by 20%, in five years, you'll have doubled your income.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:50.340]   And in 10 years, you will have 5x'd your income if you could repeat it every single year.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.340]   So focus on this.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:56.300]   I know there are a very small subset of listeners saying, "Joshua, Joshua, it's too much.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.300]   It's too much.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.300]   It's too much."
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.300]   Okay, maybe it is.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.440]   Maybe you can't accomplish it.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.420]   Maybe you can't.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:10.860]   But if you target increasing your income by 20% and you hit increasing your income by
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.460]   13%, isn't that better than what you would if you weren't thinking about it?
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.180]   If you target your income, increasing your income by 20%, and you recognize you can't
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.460]   do it at your current company, you can't do it in your current job, and you spend the
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.920]   next two years job hunting and retraining and recredentialing and whatnot, and you find
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.020]   up getting a job where you do have the chance of doing it, hopefully a job that you like
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.460]   better than the one you're not doing, then you don't...
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.780]   Excuse me, I'm getting tongue-tied.
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:44.100]   The point is, work for it.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.100]   Imagine it.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.100]   Set it as a goal.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.060]   Write it out every day.
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.220]   Exactly how much you earned is 20% higher than where you are.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.700]   It's going to put you on the track for success.
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.100]   There are many other goals that you could set, but I wanted to give you five simple
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.460]   ones that I think are applicable to everyone.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:10.360]   By way of review, goal number one, build an intelligent financial tracking system.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.260]   Make sure that you build for yourself an intelligent, simple financial tracking system that will
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.340]   give you the data that you need to know about your life.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.300]   Goal number two, analyze your data.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.180]   Set yourself a goal of actually sitting down and looking at your numbers.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.180]   Where am I?
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.540]   Plug some numbers into an online retirement calculator.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.020]   Figure out, just look at some stuff.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.020]   Analyze it.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.140]   I like to do it monthly.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.220]   Make yourself a monthly financial planning meeting.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.300]   Sit down on maybe a Sunday afternoon in your home office, or maybe it's Monday morning,
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.820]   the first Monday of the work week.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:48.460]   You go into the office an hour early or something, and pick one category to explore, one thing
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.780]   to think about, one thing to research, et cetera.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:56.220]   Goal number three, set a goal to pay off all non-mortgage debt.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:01.300]   If you have any non-mortgage debt, set a goal to pay off all non-mortgage debt.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:06.000]   Goal number four, set a goal to fully fund your retirement accounts.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.500]   If you just fully fund your retirement accounts, you're going to be rich.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.300]   Then goal number five is set a goal to increase your income by 20%.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.020]   Set a goal to increase your income by 20%.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.340]   If you picked one of these, you're going to be in a better situation.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.580]   Any one of them will massively improve your situation.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:33.420]   If you did all five of these, a year from now, two years from now, three years from
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.180]   now, you'll be on the fast track to wealth.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:43.940]   These are simple, doable, practicable, and practical goals that you can set.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.380]   I hope that you have enjoyed this.
