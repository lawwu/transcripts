[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   So how does how long the house has been on the market play into this?
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.940]   When you see something that's been on for a while, or we'll get to something that just
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.940]   came on after?
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.960]   Hey, I mean, it's just like online dating, right?
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.780]   I don't do online dating, but I know how the thing works.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.660]   If she's been single for 6 days, she's probably not in a rush to take your response to go
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.660]   out with you Friday.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.680]   But if she's been single for 6 months, she's probably going to give you a little bit more
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.580]   attention when you send that message.
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.700]   When a seller first puts their house on the market, they have all the leverage.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.340]   They have tons of interest, people are going to look at their home showings are being scheduled.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.440]   Agents are calling all excited.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   We really love the house.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.440]   Do you have any other offers?
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.980]   It's this frenetic, crazy emotional pace where the sellers are trying to think of how can
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.540]   I leverage this to get as much money as possible, which is really where I'm trying to guide
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.540]   my clients away.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.500]   I don't want you in that feeding frenzy.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.900]   If no one buys that house after 14 to 21 days, interest is starting to slow by day 30, day
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.900]   40.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.900]   They're getting worried.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.960]   It's not who's the best guy that I can take that gets to take me to prom.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.740]   It's am I going to prom at all?
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.740]   I just want a date.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.060]   Does anyone want to buy my house?
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.060]   I'm stuck.
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.060]   I might not be able to move.
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060]   And I write about this in some of the books that I've published for BiggerPockets for
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.060]   agents.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.980]   There's this spectrum of fear and greed.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.540]   We usually all start off on the greed side.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.700]   And as you slide across, you end up in the fear side.
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.900]   You're worried, "I might not sell the house at all."
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.980]   So in most markets, depending on what your average day is on market, this wouldn't apply
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.820]   in an area with $7 million homes that tend to sit on the market for 6 months before they
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.820]   sell.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.420]   But for your regular starter homes, they should be selling in less than 30 days in most markets
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420]   in the country.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.340]   So the minute you get past that point, you're going to start seeing some worry in sellers
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.660]   and they will be open to more aggressive offers or terms that are more favorable to the buyer.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.460]   What happens if you are in a hot market?
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.320]   And let's say you've identified a neighborhood, you've looked, maybe a house comes on every
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.940]   2 or 3 months, and you know, "This is what I want."
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.980]   You say, "The moment that house comes on the market, it's hot.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.660]   It's the worst time."
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.780]   Is there a way to get ahead of that?
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.900]   Is there a way to find homes before they get on the market and buy them?
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.500]   Is that finding the right agent?
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.900]   Or how do you get what might be a hot home before it's hot?
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.220]   Rob, what have you been doing?
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.940]   You've gotten a couple of deals this way.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.940]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.940]   So there are definitely a few.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.940]   I mean, there's...
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.220]   Let's see.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.500]   There's the creative finance and the sub 2 deal.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.220]   And that's effectively where you're cold calling a bunch of property owners and also wholesaling
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.720]   where you cold call property owners and basically try to buy the property directly from them
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.940]   versus going the realtor route.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.180]   That's a very popular niche within real estate.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.020]   But honestly, I think having a really big network of realtors that you're friendly with
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.260]   is super important.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.500]   And more than just having a bunch of realtors in your network, finding a realtor that I
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   see...
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.260]   And this is where the marketing thing comes into play too.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.360]   So finding a realtor that's very good at marketing and having a vast network of realtor friends
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.100]   that can pass each other deals to you or pass deals to each other, that to me is super important.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.420]   Because if you find someone that's very new and very green in the industry, they probably
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.860]   don't have a lot of other real estate colleagues necessarily.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.420]   But if it's someone that's been working in the industry for a while, they have the opportunity
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.660]   to find all these deals before they ever hit the market.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.020]   So I have realtors that are texting me all the time that they're like, "Hey, my bud just
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.020]   sent me this.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.900]   It's gonna hit the market next week.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.220]   They're interested in selling it before even going to market.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.420]   Are you interested?"
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.080]   And I'll look at a deal much quicker, much faster, and much more intentionally knowing
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.940]   that I've got first dibs on it.
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.020]   Do you think that applies for a consumer?
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.020]   Should I...
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.380]   If I'm looking to buy a home in a neighborhood, should I just talk to all the agents in the
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.140]   neighborhood and say, "Hey, I'm looking to buy a home.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.160]   There's nothing on the market I want right now.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.580]   But I just want you to know, if you can find me something, I'm ready to go."
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.420]   And just talk to 10 agents.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.900]   Do agents like that kind of behavior or...?
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.900]   Not really.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900]   No, not really.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.620]   Because you send the message that you're looking for an open relationship and they're wanting
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.100]   a committed relationship.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.540]   So it doesn't benefit me as an agent if you come and you're talking to 12 agents in the
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.540]   years.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.340]   If you find me the deal, I'll buy it from you.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.420]   That sounds great, but I don't need to sell it to you.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.740]   If I get a listing, it's so hot right now, everyone's going to want to buy it.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.580]   I don't have to discount my commission.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.460]   There's people that would probably give me extra commission if they wanted to get that
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.220]   home or I want to be able to go to my seller and tell them I got 10 offers on their home
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.980]   and I want to look like a rock star to them.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.440]   So I don't think the "go wide instead of deep" strategy works unless it's a buyer's market.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.620]   When you are in those situations where it's very difficult to find someone to buy a home
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.180]   --we're talking 2010 when there were for sale signs everywhere.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   Listings were all over the place.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.220]   REO inventory was massive, but there weren't a lot of pre-approved buyers that were willing
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.940]   to step in and buy a house.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.740]   Then that strategy makes a lot more sense.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.460]   That's where you're reaching out to all these agents saying, "Hey, if you get a deal, bring
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.540]   it to me and I'll buy it because you're the prize in that situation."
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.980]   They need a buyer.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.820]   And you're basically saying, "Listen, I'm one of the few buyers that's out there that
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   could do this thing.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.260]   But if you want my business, you're going to have to make it worth my while."
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.540]   That works a lot better than in a market like today, where you're just one out of a whole
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.500]   bunch of other people that are all struggling to try to get a house.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   I'm actually really glad you asked that, Chris.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.140]   I'm glad you clarified, David, because Chris, for reference, I'm in about 16 different markets
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.140]   around the country.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.700]   So I actually have a massive network of realtors in different cities.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.140]   They're all very aware of exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.260]   So when they get a pocket listing or an off-market listing, they text me directly.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.300]   When I'm working in a city, specifically, or in a market specifically, I do want just
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.300]   one realtor.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.980]   And that's why I say, "I want to find a realtor that's got a lot of realtor friends that can
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.860]   help find some of those off-market deals."
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.780]   So it's about finding someone that's connected.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.700]   Is that as simple as just seeing whose name pops up in a neighborhood most for sale signs?
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.140]   Who represented most of the sales or any other tactics for finding that super connected agent?
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.880]   I see why it would look that way.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.060]   But there are so many real estate agents, Chris.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.020]   It's like the ones you see are the tip of the iceberg.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.140]   There's so many of them.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.340]   There's way too many agents.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.620]   We don't need this many.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.860]   It reminds me of a scene in The Office where Dwight and Michael are walking through a crowded
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.980]   room and Dwight says, "There's too many people.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.980]   We need another plague."
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.500]   There's just so many agents that have flooded into the real estate space.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.700]   Like people coming to California in 1849 thinking they're going to strike gold.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.580]   They're all fighting to try to get that seller to think of them.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.860]   It's just this massive marketing campaign that every agent is throwing themselves in
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.420]   front of people.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.420]   And now you've got investors that are also sending letters to those same people saying,
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.420]   "I want to buy your house.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.860]   I want to buy your house."
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.460]   Most home sellers know, in general, they have what everyone wants.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.420]   Their home is valuable.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.940]   You're probably not going to put things in your favor by just talking to every real estate
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.100]   agent out there and saying, "Hey, I want to buy a house if you get one."
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.020]   Because if they can get a listing, it's guaranteed to sell.
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.140]   There's no reason they're going to go to you particularly.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.180]   And then this is a very short question, but it's important.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.620]   How much does the brand behind the agent matter?
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.620]   Is it all about the agent or is it all about the agency they work at or the brokerage firm
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.620]   they work at?
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.580]   The only people that think a broker matters is the broker.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.740]   Your clients never care who your broker is.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.120]   It's 100% the agent.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.860]   So if you're trying to find someone and they're like, "Oh, you can work with my colleague
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.860]   on this."
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.860]   That's a red flag.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.060]   It used to be really useful.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.520]   Just a little history lesson.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.860]   Because there was a time where if you wanted to buy a house that Remax was listing, you
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.840]   had to go to a Remax agent at that office to buy that house.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.220]   So Remax had their listings, Coldwell Banker had theirs, Century 21 had theirs.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.900]   And you would jump from broker to broker and look at their inventory.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.220]   When we created the multiple listing service, this was an agreement between all brokerages
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.060]   that they would all put their listings into one central location that everybody could
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.820]   see which eventually morphed into the online listing portals that we all see when we're
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.140]   looking for homes.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.140]   That eliminated the value of going to an individual broker because now you can see everybody's
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.140]   inventory in the same place.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.540]   And if people that you know had success using those online brokers that are like, "We're
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.780]   just going to cut your rate and give you huge discounts."
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.460]   I know Redfin does that.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.860]   Have you heard success stories there?
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.060]   Is the savings worth it?
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.780]   In our industry, Chris, I'm just going to tell you the brutal truth.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.300]   I look for a Redfin agent to be on the other side of the transaction because I know I'm
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.460]   going to destroy him in negotiation.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.460]   Because they don't make hardly any money on these deals.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.980]   They usually go there when they're desperate for food.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.580]   "I'm starving.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.140]   Please Redfin, give me some deals," or whatever the discount brokerage is.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.140]   I've had massive success, particularly targeting listings that are Redfin listings because
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.540]   those Redfin agents are...
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.540]   Not all the time.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.540]   I'm sure there's going to be a Redfin agent out there who's going to say, "Well, I'm a
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.540]   Redfin agent.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.540]   I'm good."
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.540]   Yes, they do exist.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.540]   But in general, any of those discount brokerages...
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.020]   I sell the most Redfin homes in this neighborhood.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.020]   (laughs)
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.020]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.740]   In fact, that might even be an advantage to tell people to look for those because your
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.940]   agent is going to have a field day with their agent if you have a good one.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.940]   One more tip.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.940]   I got one more tip here.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.820]   If the listing says, "Run, don't walk," it's probably not that great of a listing.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.820]   (laughs)
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.820]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.820]   We were just talking about this yesterday.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:16.300]   Every listing agent is putting their house boast of 5 bedrooms, boast of amazing light,
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.500]   boast of a great view.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.420]   These houses are just boasting all over the place.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.900]   Bay Area real estate has become very arrogant.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.900]   (laughs)
