[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.260]   Well, given your outspoken position on divorce and remarriage, we get a lot of questions
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.200]   in the inbox on this front.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.680]   Here's one from a podcast listener named Lisa.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.640]   "Dear Pastor John, I read your long article about divorce and remarriage and agreed all
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.840]   along.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.080]   Near the end, you restated that only God can end a marriage.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.080]   Yes.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.280]   Then you went on to say that remaining in a second marriage is right.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.580]   I noticed that you did not give scripture to back up that point, and that's where I
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.680]   no longer agreed with you.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.400]   All the other scriptures seem to only prove that marriage is impossible to end.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.640]   Are there any passages to suggest that a divorced spouse should remain in their second marriage?"
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.720]   It's important to point out that this question that's being asked is a question everyone
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.320]   has to face, not just me with my conservative view of divorce and remarriage.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.160]   It's a question that everyone, except those who think that all divorce and remarriage
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.840]   is biblical.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.480]   If you have any limits at all in your view of divorce and remarriage, you will sooner
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:28.360]   or later meet a couple who has transgressed even your limits and are in a marriage that
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.360]   they should not have entered, that you think they should not have entered, not just me.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   This is a question then for almost every Christian.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:49.040]   If the marriage that you are in was entered wrongfully, you shouldn't have entered it,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.840]   but you stay in it.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   That's the question.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.400]   And my answer is yes.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.640]   Repent honestly before God to each other and to him.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.320]   Admit it should not have happened.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:14.680]   Ask for forgiveness from each other and from God, perhaps from former spouses, and then
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:24.720]   keep your promises that you made to each other when you made your vows, rather than a second
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680]   time breaking your word.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.440]   And Lisa's question is, are there texts for that opinion?
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.900]   I mean, you're just saying that, Piper.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.400]   What about the Bible?
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.200]   And I want to say here, I could be wrong about this.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.400]   I could be drawing inference from texts illegitimately, but there do seem to me to be three or four
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.920]   or more pointers in this direction in the Bible, and I'll give them to Lisa now.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   Number one, in Joshua chapter nine, there's the story of the Gibeonites, who you may remember
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.600]   hear about Joshua and the Israelites destroying cities, and they don't want to be destroyed,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.700]   so they know they're going to be next on the list of destruction.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:25.560]   So they pretend to be from a faraway country, and they lie to Joshua, and they get Joshua
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.800]   to promise that he will not kill them because they're not in his territory.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.560]   And Joshua makes a vow and swears to them before God that he won't kill them.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.520]   And then he finds out that they were lying to him.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:52.280]   And it says in chapter nine, verse 19, "All the leaders said to the congregation, 'We
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.960]   have sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.'"
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:08.720]   Now, my point there is that it appears that a vow that you enter wrongfully—there are
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.480]   two reasons why they shouldn't have entered this vow.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.840]   One is because the Gibeonites were lying to them, and two is because it says explicitly
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.920]   they did not consult God, and God explicitly intended for the Gibeonites to be destroyed.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.000]   And now they're keeping the vow they never should have made under horrible circumstances,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.400]   thus elevating the importance of promise-keeping or vow-keeping, even when it was entered into
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.560]   wrongfully.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.720]   And I'm saying that perhaps suggests—I think it does suggest—that a vow you make
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.900]   to a person to be their husband or their wife till death do you part is not something to
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.840]   be taken lightly.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:07.240]   Number two, Jesus talked to the woman at the well in terms that suggest pretty strongly
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:17.040]   that he believed she had five genuine husbands and one non-genuine live-in.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.120]   He put it like this.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.760]   He said to her, "Go call your husband and come here."
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.960]   And the woman answered him, "I have no husband."
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.120]   And Jesus said to her, "You're right saying I have no husband, because you've had five
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.480]   husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.320]   What you have said is true."
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.720]   Now think about that.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   What does that imply?
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.960]   It's true that the Greek—that includes this text here—does not have a different
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.660]   word for husband and man or husband and male.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.280]   So it could be translated, "You've had five men, and the man you now have is not
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.420]   your man."
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.720]   But even if you translate it that way, it doesn't make sense unless you distinguish
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.080]   this sixth man from those other five in some way, because he says, "This is not your
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.520]   man.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   Those were your men.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   This is not your man.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.640]   This is not your husband.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   Those were your husbands."
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.120]   What was the difference?
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.340]   The only thing I know to suggest is that they had somehow formalized the relationship in
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.280]   a ceremony in which they took some promises to create the relationship that was known
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.720]   as marriage or husband-wife.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:50.920]   So it seems Jesus put some stock in calling those five men real husbands, different from
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.360]   five live-in boyfriends that she never married.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.800]   Here's the third one.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.440]   And this one comes, interestingly enough—I was talking this over with all the team of
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.120]   the Together for the Gospel guys, and I won't say who said it, but one of them, I thought,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.520]   very provocatively pointed this out.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:20.440]   Jesus does use the verb "marry" for what they should not do and do do when he's
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.280]   forbidding them from doing it.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.800]   Let me give you—let me show you what I mean.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.480]   Matthew 5:32, "Whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.080]   So he doesn't say, "Whoever presumably marries" or "tries to marry."
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.120]   He says "marries."
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:49.160]   He doesn't say "presumes to marry" or "tries to marry" as if, yes, this is a
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.960]   real marriage being created.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.880]   It should not be created, and it's like committing adultery when you enter it.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.560]   He says the same, similar kind of thing in Mark 10, 12, 11, and 12.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.760]   He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:14.240]   her, and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:24.200]   So if Jesus is willing to call wrongfully entered relationships marriages, then it seems
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:33.360]   to me that we should hold people to the expectations of holiness and permanence implied in the
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.560]   word "marriage" till death do us part.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.480]   So I take the warning that remarriage involves adultery—whoever divorces his wife and marries
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:52.200]   another commits adultery—not to mean that sexual relations in a wrongfully entered relationship
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:00.560]   can never be sanctified through repentance and forgiveness, but rather that an unholy
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.160]   relationship involves unholy sex.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:14.640]   Until that relationship is newly consecrated to God through repentance and forgiveness,
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.680]   that relationship remains tainted at every level.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.900]   One last thought.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:30.040]   If this seems strange, that a prohibited relationship can become a consecrated and holy one, consider
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.320]   the example—and there are several in the Bible—of the kingship of Israel.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.240]   The people came to Samuel in 1 Samuel 8 and said, "Now appoint for us a king to judge
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.140]   us like the nations."
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:50.000]   But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.760]   But Samuel prayed to the Lord, and the Lord said, "Obey the voice of the people in all
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.520]   that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.800]   king over them."
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:14.680]   And yet, in spite of this evil origin of this new relationship of king and people and God,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.080]   God made the kingship an integral part of his plan for Jesus to come as the King of
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.680]   Kings and Lord of Lords and as the Son of David.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:34.320]   So for those four reasons, examples, kinds of texts in the Scripture, I would appeal
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:45.600]   to those in a marriage they should not have entered to remain there and consecrate themselves
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:56.360]   by confession and repentance and consecration so that henceforth they will keep their sacred
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.360]   promises.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.920]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.080]   Everyone should stop and go read that article.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.040]   It's titled Divorce and Remarriage, a position paper written by John Piper back in July of
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   1986.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:17.520]   It's a very key document to read and to understand, and you can find it, of course, at DesiringGod.org.

[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   years.
