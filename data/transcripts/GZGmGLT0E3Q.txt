[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.160]   found in that portion of scripture which we read at the beginning in the book of
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.560]   the Prophet Ezekiel in the 36th chapter and the 16th verse, the 16th verse in the
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:26.480]   36th chapter of the book of the Prophet Ezekiel. Moreover the word of the Lord
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.240]   came unto me saying and then follows the entire section which we read at the
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.120]   beginning. But I want this evening particularly to concentrate on this
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.840]   introductory statement this 16th verse and through it and by means of it have a
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.920]   general look with you also at the entire statement of the whole paragraph which
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.240]   we have already read together. Now the first thing that strikes anybody who's
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.800]   at all familiar with the Bible is that this is a phrase which is found in many
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.840]   places in the Bible. Indeed it is one of the most characteristic statements of
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.800]   phrases especially of the prophecies which are recorded in the Old Testament.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.120]   It's just a typical illustration it's the kind of thing that not only Ezekiel
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.840]   keeps on saying but Jeremiah says it Isaiah says it they all say it. The word
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:44.560]   of the Lord came unto me saying and then there follows the message. Now I want to
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.240]   call attention to this because it seems to me that here we have presented to us
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.640]   very clearly and very plainly what is the message of this entire book. Now the
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.200]   context is always interesting. The children of Israel at this point when
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.840]   this word of God came to Ezekiel were not only in trouble but they were in
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.000]   captivity. Ezekiel is one of those prophets who writes in the midst of
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.520]   captivity. Now the other some of the other prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.280]   they wrote before the captivity while the children of Israel were still in
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.200]   their land but by this time by the time this man Ezekiel came the calamity had
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.320]   happened. Nemesis had descended upon them. Their great city was a mess of rubble
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.520]   and they had been carried away as captives by the Chaldeans to the land of
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.160]   Babylon. Now there they were I say and they were having time thus in misery and
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.800]   in captivity to think and to consider their whole situation and looking back
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   this is what they found. Things had been all right with them for a while. They'd
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.360]   been put into their land by God and they had experienced blessing and prosperity
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.960]   but here they are now in captivity. What's the cause of all this? Well they
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.560]   look back across the history and this is what they saw. Things began to go wrong
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.080]   and in that situation they were addressed by a number of people. There
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.440]   were men whom they called prophets. They were teachers who claimed that they were
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.000]   profound students of affairs and of history and that they as the result of
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.080]   their study and their meditations had arrived at certain conclusions and were
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.680]   able to offer advice to the people and they had been speaking and they had been
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   addressing the people and their message was in effect that though things were
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.760]   not all right well there was nothing very serious nothing to be alarmed about
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.680]   at any rate and that if they made a slight modification here and there all
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.200]   would be well with them. But on the other hand there were certain men who claimed that
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.400]   they had been specially called and sent by God. Men like Isaiah, Jeremiah and
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   others whose works are recorded in this Old Testament canon they had come and
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.400]   they'd said something very different indeed. They had said that the situation
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.840]   was desperately serious and that unless the nation repented in sackcloth and
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.720]   ashes that calamity was bound to come. They're all typified in a sense by a
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.920]   phrase that was uttered by the Prophet Joel. "Rend your hearts and not your
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:19.280]   garments and turn unto the Lord your God." The situation said these men is so
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.720]   desperate it's so urgent that nothing but a most essential renovation a
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.200]   complete humbling before God and a turning back to him can save the
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.280]   position. And as you know there was a great quarrel going on between these two
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.960]   types. These first people the so-called false prophets ridiculed these latter
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.320]   the true prophets. And they comforted the people and the people set at ease in
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.400]   Zion. They rested on their lees as the picturesque expression puts it. And they
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.120]   went on enjoying themselves some of them lying on their ivory beds and indulging
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.800]   in luxury and living for sheer pleasure and drink and dancing and things of that
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.960]   kind. And so the position continued to degenerate from bad to worse until at
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.720]   last the predictions of the two prophets were very literally fulfilled and the
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.480]   Chaldean host came and attacked and demolished the city as I say and carried
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.280]   away the people captive into the land of Babylon. Now that was the thing which
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.800]   they saw when they look back and here they are now in this land of Babylon by
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.960]   strange waters down and out as it were and finished. And what hope is there for
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.680]   them what can they do? They don't want to hear the easy smooth things of the false
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.080]   prophets any longer at last they'd seen through them. But what can they do? They're
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.000]   weak, they're helpless, they don't know what to do nor where to turn. How can they
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.600]   ever get back to their land? How can they ever get back to their great city of
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.840]   Jerusalem? What hope is there for them as a people and as a nation? Here they are
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   disgraced, humbled and humiliated and in shame in the sight of all the nations.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.560]   What hope is there what can be done? And there is none apart from the words of
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:39.240]   our text. But this is how it came. Here is a man amongst them called Ezekiel and
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.040]   suddenly to him comes the word of the Lord. This wasn't the first time it came.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.160]   You read his whole book you'll find how it came repeatedly. He was with them, he
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.720]   was one of the captives, he sat down amongst them in their misery and in
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.840]   their shame he sat down amongst them by the waters of Babylon. But into the utter
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.040]   hopelessness of it all there came to him this word of the Lord opening a door,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:19.600]   giving a hope, showing a way of deliverance. Now I am calling your
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:28.560]   attention to all this because I say it is so typical and characteristic of the
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:35.680]   whole of the biblical message. That is precisely what the Bible does at all
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.440]   times and in all generations. That is what it's doing this very evening.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.720]   Because surely our situation is so strangely analogous to that of the
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.040]   children of Israel in the helplessness and the hopelessness of their captivity
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:04.520]   there in Babylon. Isn't the position exactly the same? Look at the history.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.200]   You've got an exact repetition of what I've just been saying. Final disaster has
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.600]   not overtaken us nor our world but we are in trouble, we are in difficulties.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.960]   And the whole question is as to what is the matter. And again you see the same
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:33.440]   old division as before. You pick up your newspapers and you look at their front
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.880]   pages and you scarcely know what to think nor what to say. Is the world in
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.080]   trouble or isn't it? Look at the latest news, look at the things that have given
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.200]   prominence. What is the situation of the world this evening? Is there anything
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.840]   critical at all? Well there can't be because the great thing is some marriage
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.800]   that's to take place this week and the excitement and the show and the fuss and
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.560]   the pomp. There can't be anything wrong with the world. Why everything's
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:18.360]   wonderful, let's have a good time. You see what I mean, you see the confusion. The
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.760]   general impression given is no no there's nothing very serious about it all.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.280]   And here are these voices that are speaking to the modern men. He's got a
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.400]   feeling that there's something wrong and yet he listens to these various voices.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.480]   I've mentioned one, the voice that comes, the word that comes with his newspaper.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.440]   And he finds it very difficult to know whether he really ought to take things
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.600]   seriously or not. So much is given to sheer pleasure, to that which is animal,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.640]   to sheer sport and things like that. That's given such prominence. He says it
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:03.560]   can't be serious. That's one voice that comes. Oh there are many other voices. The
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.960]   voice comes to him, the word comes to him through the wireless. He takes its
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.560]   programs and he says well now let me see how much is there here which is serious.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.920]   Very little. Most of it's sheer entertainment, very funny. We're told to
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.680]   laugh the whole time and have a marvelous wonderful time together. He
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   says there can't be anything very serious after all. Why should he be
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:34.460]   troubled about it? That's another word that comes. Oh there are many other words.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:41.920]   There's the word of the politician, confused again, uncertain, not seeming to
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:50.320]   know which way to turn or what to do. Confusion all along the line. The word of
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.640]   the philosophers, the words of the poet, and all of them I say when put together
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.680]   they somehow leave you with this impression that while there is a problem
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:06.760]   and while there is trouble there's nothing very desperate here. But above
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.920]   all I say the tragedy is there is no line given, there is no way open. There
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.560]   seems to be no door opening before us. What can we expect? Have we any prospect
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.880]   of anything better? Now I'm just putting these questions to you. As you listen to
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.840]   the various voices that come from various directions to you as a typical
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:35.200]   modern person, what do you make of it all? Isn't it all confusion? Isn't it a
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:43.800]   repetition of this old story? At ease in Zion, people still thinking mainly of
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.600]   having their supposed good time, spending all their money, getting things while
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.300]   they've got it and so on, living for the moment, hand to mouth, day to day. Isn't
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:01.360]   that the picture? Thus I say we are confronted by this baffling, confusing
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:12.680]   situation. And were it not that still we have this word from the Lord there would
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:21.080]   be no hope at all. But here it still is. Here is still the message that keeps on
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:30.880]   coming. As it did then, as it has always done, and as it is still doing. But the
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.200]   tragedy is that the vast majority of people seem to be heedless and
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.320]   unconcerned about this. They feel it's irrelevant, they feel it's far away. The
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.200]   thing they say to do is this, to follow the news, the visit of these men from
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.280]   Russia and so on. This is the relevant thing. Here it is on one hand and on the
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.600]   other. The Bible, well an old book, old-fashioned, out of date, obviously has
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.760]   got nothing to say to us now. And they're looking in every direction except in
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.200]   this direction, exactly as the children of Israel did. Well but the question is,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:11.320]   why do they do that? Why should one listen to the Bible? Why should one
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.760]   listen to this particular word? Why are we met together to consider it this
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.960]   evening? Are we doing something wise or are we being foolish? Are we simply
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:27.320]   perpetuating some ancient custom? Or is this the most relevant word coming to
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   mankind in its confusion this very night? Well now then, another way of
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.920]   putting all that is just to put it like this, that nothing surely is more
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:47.080]   important for us than our whole approach to this book. So many people are not
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:53.240]   Christian and are in trouble and are missing the glories of this salvation
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:00.600]   because their whole fundamental initial approach is wrong. Their whole attitude
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.400]   to this word is wrong. Well what therefore is of importance as we come to
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.160]   consider it? Well let me note some of these things that are suggested here on
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.880]   the surface this evening. The first thing we have for regarding this as special
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:22.440]   and unique is this, that it is a revelation from God. Moreover the word of
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:30.880]   the Lord came unto me saying. Now that's the fundamental reason for listening to
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.320]   this and paying attention to this. It's in a different category from everything
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.000]   else. It's no part of the preaching of the gospel to disparage everything else
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.800]   in and of itself. But we are entitled to say this, that everything else apart from
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:54.080]   this is always human. It's the word of man. It's men's thought. It's men's
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:00.720]   understanding. It's men's idea. It's what a man thinks. But the uniqueness of this
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:08.160]   lies in the fact that it is a revelation from God. It is God himself speaking. And
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.840]   my dear good friends, if it's of interest to you that's my only reason for being a
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.320]   preacher. I wouldn't insult you by standing in front of you and simply
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:23.600]   giving my own ideas in this modern confused situation. I frankly admit that
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.240]   human thought alone cannot give one an understanding of it. This present century
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   seems to have belied all the prophecies. It seems to have broken all the rules. If
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.720]   there is advance, well why are things as they are? Why have they gone wrong? All
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.920]   our scientific notions seem to be turned topsy-turvy. Why are we as we are? That's
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:50.800]   the question. But no, I say this isn't human. This is the word of God. Now that
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.520]   is the claim that is made by all these men who appear in the Old Testament and
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:03.720]   in the New Testament. Ezekiel was just a man like all those other Israelites in
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   captivity. And he was sitting down by their side by the waters of Babylon as
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.880]   disconsolate and as hopeless as they were, when suddenly he tells us he was
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.760]   given a vision. What he writes isn't the result of his cogitation and meditation
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:26.400]   and thought and analysis, not at all. He says I did nothing, it came to me. It's
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.760]   something he received. God began to speak to him. We needn't go in detail into how
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.160]   exactly he did it tonight, but God can speak without audible words. He can speak
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.800]   to the spirit. He can impress truth on the mind. And this man was spoken to by
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:49.160]   God and he gave his message to his fellow countrymen. Now they all claim
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:59.600]   what he claims here. The burden of the Lord, they say. The word of the Lord came
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.560]   to me. And of course this is the whole claim which the Bible makes for itself
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:13.160]   everyone. Now some of these men, they not only tell us that it isn't their own
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.400]   thought and their own idea, some of them are quite honest enough and frank enough
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.080]   enough to tell us this, that when God did speak to them and give them their
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:29.040]   message, they themselves decided that they wouldn't speak it. They knew it was
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.400]   going to be unpopular. Jeremiah tells us that very honestly. He says if I say that
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.680]   I know exactly what will happen to me. I'll be hounded out of the country.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.360]   They'll throw me into prison. And they did that sort of thing to them. And he
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.480]   didn't want to be unpopular. He didn't want to speak. Oh how nice it is to be
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.560]   praised by everybody and to say the thing that man likes us to say to him.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.200]   How nice to be told by the newspaper always how wonderful we are and so on.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.280]   How different from being told that we are fools, that we are names, that we are
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:05.880]   madmen in our falling away from God. So they said I'm not going to speak it. It
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:12.200]   isn't their word, it's God's word. And the New Testament you know says exactly the
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:19.080]   same thing. The Lord Jesus Christ said the words that I speak unto you I speak
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:25.320]   not of myself but the Father that sent me he giveth the words. The works that I
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.560]   do I do not of myself the Father that sent me he doeth the works. Even he the
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:40.720]   Son of God says he's but a messenger, a voice. And you've got explicit statements.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:49.920]   All scripture is given by inspiration of God. This word claims that it's breathed
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:58.160]   in by God. Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost says the
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.880]   Apostle Peter. No prophecy of the scripture he says is of any private
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.560]   interpretation by which he means this. That all these prophetic messages are
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.000]   not as I say the excogitations of a man's mind, not something that man spins
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.160]   out. No word of prophecy is of any private interpretation. It isn't a man's
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.840]   insight, it isn't his understanding into history or philosophy. No no, holy men of
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:34.800]   God spake as they were moved, inspired, carried along, born along by the Holy
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:41.720]   Spirit. Now that is something of course which is obviously quite basic in our
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:48.360]   whole position. My message to you tonight, my challenge to you is this, that in your
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:53.720]   modern confusion, whether personal or general, you are being addressed by these
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   two schools of thought. Here is this which claims to be from God, there is all
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.360]   else which is but from men, whatever it may be said. There is no difference you
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.920]   see ultimately between those philosophies. You look at your newspaper
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.320]   front page I say again, half of it is devoted to the wedding, half of it is
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.960]   devoted to the two men from Russia. And I don't care which you say is the thing,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:28.920]   they're all men, it's all human. Now here is something which is absolutely
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:41.080]   different. The Bible starts on this supposition, that man as he is cannot
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:47.160]   attain unto truth. Now this is a very drastic statement, I'm well aware of it,
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:55.280]   but it is the first statement of the scripture. Man as he is in his sin, in his
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:04.360]   misery, and in his shame, cannot arrive at the truth about himself, his need, his
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.280]   way of deliverance. He cannot. Now that is something which I suggest to you the
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:17.480]   modern world is proving. The world has been trying to solve its problems now
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.280]   for a very long time, and is anyone foolish enough to suggest that it's any
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.360]   nearer to solving it tonight than it's ever been? The confusion is greater than
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.600]   ever. What's it mean? Well I say the world itself is proving this fundamental
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:41.840]   postulate, that man in and of himself cannot arrive at truth concerning his
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:47.400]   greatest needs. The Bible puts that in many ways. It says can a man by searching
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:57.720]   find out God? It puts it positively by saying the world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:05.360]   That is man's essential problem. So that the first thing we have to realize is
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:13.640]   this, that we are entirely dependent upon the revelation of God. Now the Bible
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:19.760]   tells you that at the very beginning. You either come to this prepared to accept
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:27.160]   it, or else you don't. I see no other alternative. It's one or the other. You
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.320]   either belong to the people who say God has spoken, and I listen, and I believe, or
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.200]   else you say now then I don't agree with this, I'll accept this and reject that,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:45.800]   and already you've denied revelation. You see how basic this is, how fundamental.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:55.040]   Man in his helplessness is shut up to revelation. The Lord Jesus Christ said,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:01.680]   "Unless he be converted and become as little children, he shall in no wise
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:07.360]   enter into the kingdom of God." He said to a learned man called Nicodemus, "You must
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.000]   be born again." You don't just stand where you are and say I've got so far then go
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.760]   on tiptoes and being given a little help get into the kingdom. Not at all. You've
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:24.680]   got to go right down. That means you confess your complete failure, you wait
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:33.920]   upon revelation. Like Ezekiel sitting by the waters of Babylon with the others in
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:44.280]   captivity, the word comes. Now that is the whole message of the Bible, that man
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:51.080]   himself cannot aspire unto God and unto salvation, but that God in his infinite
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:59.920]   grace and mercy gives it, reveals it. The word of the Lord came. I mustn't keep you
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.400]   tonight with proofs of this, but surely the moment you begin to think of it you
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:12.080]   can see how inevitable this is. The very greatness of God makes it quite
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:20.560]   impossible for men by his own efforts ever to arrive at God. Can you think of
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:29.240]   pure, absolute spirit? For God is spirit. Can you think of a person who is
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:39.200]   omnipresent and omniscient and omnipotent? It's impossible. The very
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.560]   greatness of God makes it quite impossible for us to grasp it, and yet
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.880]   men in his folly today says, "I will understand God." He puts God on the bench
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.400]   as it were, and proceeds to dissect him, that he may encompass God with his mind.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:01.960]   God is in his hands. How monstrous it is. The very greatness of God precludes the
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:11.280]   possibility. Can you think of utter, absolute holiness? Can you look into the
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.840]   sun and go on doing so without being blinded? Well, how can men look into the
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:26.000]   face of God? Eternal, absolute light, endless, everlasting holiness. Who is man
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.880]   that he can rise and stand and look God in the face? My dear friends, the thing by
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:42.720]   definition is a complete and an utter impossibility. Man will never find God.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:49.320]   I again quote you what Paul said to the Corinthians, "The world by wisdom knew
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:55.440]   not God." There has never been a man in this world who by his own efforts has
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.440]   arrived at God. Your greatest philosophers have all tried and have all
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.880]   failed equally, and they're failing as miserably today. Man, because of the very
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:12.200]   greatness of God, is shut up to revelation. If God doesn't speak, we know
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:21.240]   nothing. And then when you add to that man's nature in sin, man's condition in
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:29.440]   sin, you see how utterly impossible it is. For none of our faculties have escaped
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:38.760]   the fall. When man fell, his every faculty fell. Men's mind has fallen, his
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.640]   will has fallen, his heart has fallen, everything in men has fallen. Our brains
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:49.320]   get tired, our minds begin to show fatigue. We can follow an argument so far
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.600]   then we suddenly fail. We need training, we get it, we still can't follow. If we
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.040]   have had training, can it? How can the other person who hasn't? How can such a
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.520]   person possibly do it? No, no. The whole state and condition of men, as well as
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.780]   the greatness of God, makes it an utter and an absolute impossibility. The Bible
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:13.040]   starts by telling us all that. It says, "Look here, in your need, in your misery,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:22.760]   in your helplessness, listen. Listen to the voice of God." That is to accept our
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:31.800]   utter dependence upon revelation. This book claims to be a revelation of God
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.400]   and his eternal mind. That's the first thing. The second thing is this. It is
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.760]   always a contemporary revelation. So that this argument about the Bible, because
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.600]   it's an old book being out of date and irrelevant, falls in exactly the same
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.840]   way. Why is this message always contemporary and always relevant? Well,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:00.160]   for this good reason. Take your Bible itself and read through it, and this is
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.560]   what will strike you at once. That the Bible seems to go on saying the same
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:11.880]   thing always. It starts in the very beginning of Genesis, it says certain
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:17.200]   things. God made men, God spoke to him, men disobeyed, got into misery, and there he
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.800]   was helpless. God came and spoke to him. There it is at the beginning. We'll then
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.640]   go on to the time of the flood, same thing again. Hundreds of years have passed, but
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.600]   the same message. Time of Abram, same again, with all these kings and prophets,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.160]   same thing. Come to the New Testament, exactly the same thing. It's an
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:40.040]   astounding book that, it's a long book. It was written at different periods, by
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   different men, who didn't know one another, had no connection with one
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.880]   another, and yet they're all saying exactly the same thing. Why is that? Well
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:56.040]   the answer is clear, isn't it? Because it's always God who's speaking, and God
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.720]   doesn't change. We talk about the changes in the world, and the changes in men. I'll
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.280]   deal with that in a moment, but before you see you come to consider this, you
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:12.040]   start with this. If this is a message from God, God speaking to Abel, God
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.560]   speaking to Adam before that, God speaking to Noah, God speaking to Abram,
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.600]   God speaking to David, God speaking to the prophets, and if God is everlastingly
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.800]   the same, if God is the father of lights in whom is no variableness, neither
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   shadow of turning, and if God cannot change, well then I would expect God's
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:42.000]   message to be always the same, and it is the same. But the fact of the matter is
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.280]   also that man doesn't change either. So here's another good reason why the
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.920]   message shouldn't change. Go through those illustrations I've just been
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:03.000]   giving you, don't you see the same thing? Adam exercised his own will instead of
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.600]   obeying God's. That's the very thing we are all in our folly still doing. Cain
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:17.360]   murdered his brother. Men are still murdering one another in various ways.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.600]   David fell into grievous sin adultery.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:31.760]   The newspapers are still full of it. So why should the message change? God
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.440]   doesn't change, man doesn't change. The situation is still the same. I read of
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:42.960]   the children of Israel in the captivity of Babylon. I see the modern world. I see
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.960]   no difference. It's the different country. It's only the form. The situation is
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:52.880]   identical. God the same, man the same, in sin the same message therefore. And here
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:32:01.520]   it is, it's always contemporary. For its message you see comes to this, that the
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:09.160]   one thing that matters for us all is our relationship to God. And it doesn't matter
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.600]   whether you're alive now or whether you lived a thousand years ago or two
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.480]   thousand or six thousand. It's God and yourself and the relationship between
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:23.400]   you that really matter. So it comes to pass you see that this section which I
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.560]   read to you just now from verse 16 to the end of this chapter is a perfect
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:34.480]   statement of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It's all here. You
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.000]   can take almost any paragraph you like in the Bible and you'll find the whole
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.720]   message there. What is it? What is the message? Well it's this. What is this
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:51.760]   revelation? Well it's always the whole message, the whole statement. It's first
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:33:00.560]   and foremost the truth about God himself. That's what you don't find you see in
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.360]   these other voices. They don't tell you about him. They are interested in other
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.800]   things, human qualities, human calculations, human interests. Stop a
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   minute says the Bible. God! The word of the Lord came. And I say again that you and I
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.720]   know nothing about God apart from what we know in this book. You can say of
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.280]   course I don't think God should do this and I don't understand a God who does
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.520]   that. All right say it all but you know you know nothing about God neither do I
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   apart from what you have in this book. On what you base your knowledge of God?
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:45.840]   What right have you to put down your definitions of God? Do you know him? Have
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.120]   you spoken to him? Have you heard his voice? Have you felt his presence? Have
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:57.920]   you seen him? Of course you haven't. We know nothing about God except what he
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:04.280]   has graciously been pleased to reveal and to manifest himself to us. And he has
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:11.440]   done so. It's plain and clear. He is a holy God. Read your Ten Commandments and
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:16.400]   there you'll have some inkling of God. He's the maker and the creator of the
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.960]   world. He's the judge eternal. He is the one who sits upon the whole universe and
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:35.640]   before whom we all stand. God! Listen to the word of God my dear friend. Stop your
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:42.200]   ears to all these other voices. All this raucous laughter. All this jocularity and
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.320]   all this pretense that all is marvelous and wonderful and thrilling and exciting.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:57.360]   Shut it out I say. And begin to listen to what God tells you about
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:07.280]   himself. God in his eternal glory. Then he tells you about God creating the world
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   and creating man. You must start with these things. And then he goes on to tell
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.880]   you the truth about man himself. Oh that's the tragedy of this folly of
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.640]   listening to these other voices. They don't tell us the truth about ourselves.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   They don't tell us the truth about man. Read your newspapers and what you think
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:38.040]   man is. Well I suggest to you the only conclusion you can come to is that man
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:48.400]   is an animal. And that the most important thing for men is food and drink and sex.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:58.000]   The world is full of sex and the interest and the excitement. Sex! Is man
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.720]   but an animal? Is he a creature of the jungle? Is that all? That's the impression
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:15.600]   given. A mass of complexes. A kind of beast I say that doesn't know what to do
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:24.960]   with himself. Oh my dear friend. Begin to listen to the word of God that will tell
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:32.680]   you the truth about yourself. Man was never meant to be as he is. That was
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:37.200]   never meant to be life that you see depicted there. That isn't life. That's
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.560]   hell. That's what man is made of life. It's only here you'll realize the
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:49.240]   greatness and the glory of man. His true nature. What he was meant for. What his
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.480]   life was designed for. What he was intended to be and to do. Oh I plead with
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:02.640]   you listen to the truth about yourself as you find it here. It's all here. And
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.200]   likewise you'll find the truth about history. You'll find the truth about
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:13.120]   eternity. You'll find it all. But very especially this is the thing that this
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:19.000]   paragraph will make us concentrate on as in God's good time and in God's will we
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.400]   come to listen to it and to deal with it in detail. It will tell us very
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:31.640]   especially about this. Why is man as he is? Now let me give you a foretaste.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:38.960]   Listen to how it's put. Son of man. This was the first word. Son of man. Listen.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:48.160]   When the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:56.000]   way and by their doings. That's why things are as they are. As if God had
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.280]   said to Ezekiel, Ezekiel you are sitting with your contemporaries with your
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.560]   fellow countrymen by the waters of Babylon and you're all miserable and
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:11.760]   unhappy but men the question is why are you here instead of being there? And the
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.880]   answer is quite plain it's your own folly. You polluted your own land you
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.200]   defiled it. You rebelled against God and his way. You brought this upon yourselves.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.760]   It's you are the cause not your circumstances not anything else. You've
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:34.840]   done it yourself. It makes that very plain and clear to us and then it tells
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.920]   us how God hates that and condemns it. Oh yes it's all here we'll have to expound
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:45.640]   it. God hates that sort of thing and he hates it to this extent that he punishes
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:51.040]   it. He does condemn it. He tells them here that he it was through the Chaldeans who
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:58.280]   flung them out of their own land and threw them out amongst the nations. You
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:07.640]   can't trifle with God and you can't escape him and God punishes sin. He's
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.560]   done it from the very beginning as he threw Adam out of the Garden of Eden he
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:21.520]   threw his own people out of the land of Israel. But all thank God it doesn't stop
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:30.600]   there. The word of the Lord came unto me saying and after it had told them about
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.040]   God and about themselves and why they were as they were and why God had
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:43.560]   punished them. It goes on to tell them that in spite of it God is going to
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:51.160]   deliver them not because they deserved it but for his own glory's sake for his
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:57.980]   own name's sake. The word of the Lord came oh that's the glory of this book it
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.520]   keeps on saying that you and I had we been in the position of God we would
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.920]   have dismissed these children of Israel repeatedly and shot them out of our
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:13.760]   sight but God comes down to them and speaks to them. And there's the whole
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:24.920]   message of the gospel. When the fullness of the times had come God sent forth his
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:32.880]   own son. The word of God himself the expression of God's love God's final
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:39.840]   word to men in the person of his only son. He came and he spoke and he did and
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.720]   this bread and wine speak it's all speaking the same thing God's way of
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:52.600]   deliverance for us in spite of ourselves. And finally God's word to us in the
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:41:01.920]   light of all this which is a word that calls us to repent to think again. Oh
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.200]   said God to Ezekiel go and tell those people when they see it they'll hate
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.360]   themselves and their sins they'll abominate themselves call them to
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:19.760]   repentance and the turning back to me. That's its message it's a full message
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:26.640]   and I finally want to say this therefore it is a message which which must be
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:36.840]   accepted as it is and as a whole. That is absolutely essential. This message all
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:43.120]   hangs together. You can't pick out parts of it and say I'll take that and leave
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:48.720]   out the rest. You cannot it's impossible. This as I've started by saying is a
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.400]   revelation from God. It isn't what men have arrived at it isn't what men have
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:58.320]   discovered it's what God has revealed concerning himself. If I accept it as
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:04.900]   revelation well to be consistent to be logical I must accept it all. But you say
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:09.080]   I don't like that doctrine of sin. I'm not asking you what you like I'm asking
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:15.840]   you to believe what God has said and take it from me my friend. If you don't
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:21.960]   start by accepting what the Bible tells you about the holiness of God you'll
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:29.880]   never know his love. Never. The false prophets you see said to Israel oh they
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.000]   said it's all right God is love don't you take this too seriously carry on
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.960]   God's love but they found that God was just also and that's why they were
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:46.840]   carried away to Babylon. God is love yes but God is holy God is light and in him
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:52.600]   is no darkness at all. You must take the whole message you say I don't like that
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.200]   message about sin it seems to me to be rather degrading to ask a man to admit
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:06.640]   that he's a miserable vile sinner I don't believe that sort of stuff. I say
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.120]   to you again that it's not a question of what you like when you really get to
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:17.400]   know yourself you'll know it's true but even until you do get to know it believe
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:23.040]   it because it's God's diagnosis of you it's what God has revealed. Take it from
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:30.080]   me no man has ever known Christ as his Savior until he has known his need of a
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:36.320]   Savior. That was the whole trouble with the Pharisees. They didn't like to think
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.280]   they were sinners and they didn't see the need of his Savior and they rejected
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:45.560]   him. It's the man who sees his need who thanks God for the salvation. You can't
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:50.040]   pick and choose in this salvation. It's all here it's an entire message and
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:57.840]   every single part must be taken. If you don't what you think is gospel is
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:04.760]   something else. There are people who hate the doctrine of the blood of Christ. They
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:11.000]   say I don't like it this insistence upon the blood very well I say if you don't
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.920]   like it I can't help it but you'll never go to heaven without it. There is only
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:27.320]   one way of entering into the holiest of all it is by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:34.600]   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. That wasn't an idea
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.960]   concocted by these prophets or by any priests it was the revelation of God. God
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.880]   called Moses up onto the mountain said Moses listen I want to give you a
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:49.520]   pattern of a temple tabernacle offerings tells him all about the animals which to
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.000]   take and which to reject how to put their hands on the head of the animal
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.600]   how to slay him how to burn the carcass how to offer the blood it's God who's
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:13.160]   good. And it's always God and it must all be taken together and as a whole shall I
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:19.440]   therefore end by putting it to you in this way and this is the message of the
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:27.080]   gospel to any troubled unhappy and miserable soul in this congregation. You
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:35.360]   are like Ezekiel you are sitting in shame and in sorrow. You had your ideas
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.000]   about life and about what you could do you said you've got a strong will and
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.720]   that you could play with sin but you've discovered that it was sin that was
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.960]   playing with you and you've lost your character you've lost your reputation
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:53.400]   you feel you've discovered at last that you can't master things you are down and
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:46:03.920]   you're in shame sitting by the waters of Babylon. My dear friend listen can't you
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:12.880]   hear it can't you hear the Word of God speaking to you and telling you that in
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:19.200]   spite of all your folly and all your arrogance and all your shame and all
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:29.840]   you've brought upon yourself for his own namesake God sent his Son into the world
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:37.920]   to die for you and for your sins. He comes to you where you are sitting by
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.200]   the waters of Babylon just where you are in the midst of your failure in the
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.560]   midst of your degradation he comes to you there he tells you why you're there
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:58.640]   and he tells you how he can lift you out of it and take you back into himself
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:05.480]   cleanse you, wash you, fill you with his Spirit give you a new heart a heart of
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:15.640]   flesh and shower his mighty blessings upon you. Have you heard him? Has the Word
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:25.320]   of God in Jesus Christ come to you? That is what he's saying. God so loved the
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:31.960]   world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever whosoever believeth in
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:45.320]   him should not perish but have everlasting life. Listen. Amen.
