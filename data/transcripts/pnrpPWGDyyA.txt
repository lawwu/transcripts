[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.560]   All right, next question is from M. "What advice would you give somebody who is currently
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.440]   in a role that meets every job satisfaction criteria but is struggling with motivation?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.240]   I consistently lack motivation to do deep work and have to force myself to focus.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.760]   This at times feels almost physically impossible, especially when working from home and leads
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.200]   me to cycling between burnout, stress, boredom, and guilt."
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.560]   Well, M, this is common, especially right now, especially post-pandemic.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.320]   There's two potential forces that might be at play here that is causing this amotivation
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320]   issue.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.920]   I don't know which of these at play.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.000]   It's likely that both are maybe at play and they're mixed together, but let's talk about
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400]   both separately.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.960]   The first is what I call deep procrastination, which is an issue I wrote about originally
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.080]   back when I focused my blog just on students because it was in the student population that
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.660]   I first observed this issue.
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.440]   Deep procrastination is where you find yourself unable to work up the motivation to do work
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.560]   that needs to be done.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.120]   And for students, it'll be a paper that has to be submitted or a take-home exam that has
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.880]   to go back, and they just can't do it.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.840]   They cannot muster the internal motivation to even get started.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.400]   Deadlines will be passed.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.840]   Professors will give them extensions.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   Oftentimes they maybe end up even having to withdraw from that semester.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.640]   They just can't push themselves to work.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.200]   So I observed this when I was, especially at MIT where I was at the time among high
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.480]   achieving students, it was different than depression because in other aspects of their
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.460]   life they were not a hedonic.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.080]   So it wasn't an overall flattening of their ability to have sort of excitement or hope
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.360]   or positive feelings.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.440]   There's other things are still very exciting to them, but they couldn't do schoolwork.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.680]   So deep procrastination could be at play here.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.840]   I'll talk in a second about how to service that, but let me mention the other possible
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.520]   force at play here, which would be the idea that your mind might be dopamine sick.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:12.160]   So dopamine sick is where you have so frazzled your brain with constant targeted distraction
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.920]   at the slightest hint of boredom delivered through your phone, delivered through your
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.360]   computer screen that is now unable to work up the proper motivation to do something that's
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.000]   longer form, deeper and more complicated.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.480]   That is so frazzled from just being stimuli bombarded with all of these algorithmically
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.080]   expertly aimed sources of stimuli, these digital darts right to the base of your brainstem
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.640]   that give you that metaphorical electrical charge that when it comes time to do something
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.680]   that is comparably more stayed, that's comparably more boring, like let's start gathering sources
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.400]   and writing this memo, your brain just can't do it.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.200]   And there's been an uptick anecdotally, an uptick in dopamine sickness, especially post
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.720]   pandemic because of how much and how many people fell into a pattern of much more hyperactive
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.920]   exposure to distraction that they would have before.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.200]   Because maybe they're now at home and they're working remotely so they can have the phone
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.260]   out and things feel more haphazard.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.040]   Maybe also there is an escape what's happening.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.600]   You're anxious about things that are happening in the world and you can't confront them.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.880]   And so let me just look at the phone, let me just look at these distractions and get
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120]   that numbing in the moment.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.960]   So I think we have a lot more dopamine sickness than we had before.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.400]   Students are getting this very strongly because they got so embedded with their devices that
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.920]   now their brains are struggling.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.680]   You say, here's a senior thesis you have to write as a high school student and their brain
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.760]   is tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.120]   How can I go from seven seconds before I swipe to spending hours trying to research Charles
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.120]   DeGrete or something like this?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.600]   So both of these things might be a play.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.720]   Deep procrastination, dopamine sickness.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.060]   Let's talk about solutions to both and you can mix and match these solutions as they
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.760]   seem to fit.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.520]   So what I learned about deep procrastination is that its source tends to be a combination
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.600]   of the locus of control and motivation being away from the internal and more towards the
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   external.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.800]   So extrinsic motivation, you're like, I don't really, this feels arbitrary to me or it's
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.480]   not something I really want to do.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.680]   But it's being for a student, it might be, I don't know, my parents wanted me to be a
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   pre-med major and this chemistry class is really hard.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.880]   I never even wanted to be a doctor and this class is not something I went after because
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   I was excited about it.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.520]   And in work it could be, I don't even understand why I'm writing this self-assessment report.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.520]   So I just put it on my plate.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.960]   No one's even going to read this thing.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.080]   So you have this lack of intrinsic motivation for the work coupled with the work being hard.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.680]   So the chem class is really hard and I never wanted to be a doctor in the first place.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.160]   This report is going to be a real pain.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   I don't even really know.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.280]   There's a lot of ambiguities around how do I even do this?
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.240]   And it wasn't my idea to do this in the first place.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.640]   No one's really going to read it.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.320]   That combination can trigger deep procrastination.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.600]   So a couple of things you can do here.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.240]   One you have to reduce the hardness.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.880]   That does help.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.840]   Lock it in your organizational system.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.480]   Here is how I keep track of what's on my plate.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.680]   Here's how I plan my time during the day.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.080]   Maybe I'm doing capture, configure, control style system of professional workplace management.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.040]   I have processes in place for common collaborations.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.920]   There's a sense your brain gets of I am in control of how I approach my work that gives
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.000]   it more confidence and reduces the sense of this is some ambiguous, hard, impossible task.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.760]   So when the hard thing gets reduced to time blocks that show up in time block plans for
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.640]   the days and you sort of execute your time blocks for the days, it's not as hard to execute.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.480]   So that can help.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.240]   Simplifying obligations also helps.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.680]   So there's a sense of hardness that sometimes come here from just you're overwhelmed, you're
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.440]   overloaded, and your brain says this is enough.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.240]   Like, I don't even know what all this stuff is.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   This is impossible.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.960]   Uncle, I'm going to do deep procrastination.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.320]   So it's a good time because it's a serious problem.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.760]   You're not able to just get normal work done.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.760]   It's causing you real subjective distress.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.280]   You have to be ready to make some actual big changes here and a real simplification on
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.520]   what's on your plate, even if it ruffles some feathers, may be what you need here.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.200]   Makes your workload seem manageable or possible to your mind.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.000]   And then finally, I think you need some sort of target that your professional life is serving.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.840]   This goes back to something like lifestyle centric career planning, right?
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.920]   So here's the chain of influence I want here.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.160]   I want you to have this vision you're excited about for your life that you're not there
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.720]   yet, but a lifestyle that's different, that resonates.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.360]   Okay, there's some things I need to change.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.840]   You need to figure out how your work fits into there.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.960]   This may require some changes.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.360]   I need to shift over from this work to that work or change my focus within the organization
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.640]   because that's going to open up these options, which lets me get closer to my lifestyle.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.960]   But what you're trying to get here is a chain of influence from a motivating image of a
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.120]   desired lifestyle and have that chain of influence come all the way back to the work you're doing
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.560]   right now.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.720]   And it seems like that's arbitrary, but for the motivational sensors in our brain, that
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.920]   makes a big difference.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.860]   Now you get intrinsic motivation.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.740]   This self-assessment report is going to be a pain to write, but it's part of my plan
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.180]   to get this next promotion, which I'll then negotiate the shift over to this type of work,
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.780]   which I'll negotiate to do remotely.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:33.860]   And then I'm going to move to the upper peninsula of Michigan as my plan all specifies I should
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.860]   do.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.300]   Now the hard, hard effort deployed towards a goal you believe in is not, not hard.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.700]   It's not going to cause deep procrastination.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.820]   We appreciate hard things if we know why we're doing them.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.580]   You have to, you have to fit a why in there.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.820]   If you're just going through your job, this should be a good job.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.940]   I'm paid well, it's satisfying.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.140]   I like the people, but it's just a job.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.540]   Then doing the effort could fall into this deep procrastination trap.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.820]   So you have to connect it to a bigger positive vision.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.820]   All right.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.140]   So what about dopamine sickness?
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.340]   If that is the issue here?
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.820]   Well, you need boredom therapy.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.780]   I talk about this in my book, Deep Work.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.060]   This means a regular periods throughout your day where your mind craves distractions and
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.740]   you do not give those distractions to your mind.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.280]   This includes, for example, going on at least one walk or errand a day without your phone.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.460]   So you have no option of looking at your phone or listening to something.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.060]   I would also suggest the phone foyer method.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.500]   My phone gets plugged in by the front door in the kitchen.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.140]   When I get home, if I need to look something up or check text messages, I have to walk
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.700]   over there and read it there.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.020]   It is not with me on the couch.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.020]   It is not with me at the dinner table.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.220]   God forbid it's not with me in the bathroom.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.100]   So you still have the phone in your apartment, in your house.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.660]   You still have the conveniences of, oh, I need to look up what time this thing is tomorrow
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.900]   or text someone on meeting later, but it's not on your person.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.900]   And that makes all the difference.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.700]   So now your brain is getting used to this idea.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.820]   Sometimes we get distraction when we're bored.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.820]   Sometimes we don't.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.560]   And this is a withdrawal period.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.140]   Give that a couple of weeks and your brain will get much more comfortable with it.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.380]   You can also do interval training with your ability to concentrate on hard things.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.220]   Let me just do 20 minutes, 20 minutes with a timer.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.020]   And if I break and check email or my phone, I have to reset the timer.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.660]   Your brain says that I can do.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.140]   I might freeze when you say, right, this thing is going to take five hours, but 20 minutes
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.140]   I can do.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.820]   And you start with that 20 minutes with a timer, intensely working on things until you
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.660]   can do that pretty regularly without it being too horrifying.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.980]   20 minutes doesn't seem too bad.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.780]   And then you add 10 more minutes.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.980]   And then once 30 minutes becomes comfortable, you add 10 more minutes.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:41.140]   So you might literally need to retrain your brain for longer and longer intervals of focus
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.460]   as you escape dopamine sickness.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.900]   Finally, I think you need to care about location.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.060]   You need to care about rituals for your work.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:55.260]   So you mentioned that working from home is a big part of work seeming very hard for you
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.380]   to get started with.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.980]   This is a tricky thing.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.420]   When your home environment, your work environment is the same.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.100]   You're trying to wrench your mind from a domestic context into professional context.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.520]   It's hard to do.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.540]   Your mind is still largely ensnared in the domestic context.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.540]   It's hard.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.080]   Therefore, you don't have as much resources to actually focus on the thing ahead.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.700]   It messes with your motivational senses.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.760]   So Em, I would say go radical here.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.300]   You need a really different location.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:28.980]   You do your work, renovate the garden shed, rent some office space in a small town, spend
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.980]   money on this.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.980]   You have a big problem.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.620]   You're unable to get work started.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.580]   So you have to see this as an issue that might require big solutions and build much more
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.320]   elaborate rituals around your work.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320]   This is my work day.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.140]   I have a big walk I do to get coffee where I think I plan my day at the coffee shop.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.080]   And when I get back to my desk and my exotic location near my house, I immediately start
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.060]   working at the end of the day.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:54.120]   I go to that same coffee shop and do a shutdown routine and then do another walk to switch
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.120]   my mindset.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120]   You need radical rituals.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.300]   You need radical locations to help your mind separate work from non-work, to help your
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.500]   mind more automatically generate the motivation it needs to get going.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.900]   You're not just forcing it, white knuckling it.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.820]   Hey, let me just put this laundry basket down, walk past my kid over here who's homesick
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.160]   and just say, "Concentrate now."
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.560]   And you're staring at the computer amidst all of that chaos.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.020]   So I don't know if you have deep procrastination.
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.780]   I don't know if you have dopamine sickness.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.800]   I don't know if it's some mix of those two things.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.580]   But think about those solutions and the types of solutions that seem to resonate with you.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.580]   Go with those.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.880]   That'll probably point you towards what the real problem actually is.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.460]   Did you come up with a term, dopamine sickness?
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.460]   I think so.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.460]   Yeah, I think you did too.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.460]   I mean, it might be around.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.460]   I just made it up, but-
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.460]   I like it.
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.800]   You come up with a lot of terms.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   I like terms.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.860]   Well, there's a show about the opioid crisis called Dope Sick.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.860]   Oh, there is?
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.860]   Yes.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.780]   That's probably what I'm implicitly playing off of.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.600]   (upbeat music)
