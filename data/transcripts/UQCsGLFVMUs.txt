[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.120]   The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, has spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.840]   to its setting.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.120]   Out of Zion the perfection of beauty God has shown forth.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.040]   May our God come and not be silent.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.080]   May the fire of fire devour us before him and the storm whirls around him.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.240]   He calls the heavens above and the earth to render justice to his people.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.920]   Gather my holy ones to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.440]   In the heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge, Selah.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.480]   Hear, O my people, and I will speak.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.560]   O Israel, I will testify against you.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.120]   Your God, I do not reprove you for your sacrifices, and your burnt offerings are continually before
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   me.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.200]   I shall take no young bull out of your house, nor male goats out of your foals.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.560]   For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.440]   I know every bird of the mountains, and everything that moves in the field is mine.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.160]   If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine as well as its fullness.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.520]   Shall I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of male goats?
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.000]   Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400]   Call upon me in the day of distress.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.640]   I shall rescue you, and you will glorify me.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.600]   But to the wicked, God says, what right have you to recount my statutes, and to take my
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.640]   covenant in your mouth?
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.320]   For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.760]   When you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you associate with adulterers.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.880]   You let your mouth loose in evil, and you harness your tongue for deceit.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.360]   You sit and speak against your brother.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.160]   You slander your own mother's son.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.440]   These things you have done, and I kept silent.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.760]   You thought that I was just like you.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.400]   I will reprove you and state the case in order before your eyes.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.600]   Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there will be none
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   to deliver.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.220]   He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, and he who orders his way, I
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.880]   shall show the salvation of God.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.380]   Amen.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
