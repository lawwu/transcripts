[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who joined the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.480]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.880]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.120]   You heard about it here again.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.640]   That's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.200]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.120]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.800]   If you're new here, I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.120]   And each week I sit down with the world's best experts to learn the
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.680]   strategies, tactics, and frameworks you can use to have a happier,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.320]   healthier, and wealthier life.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.560]   This week, I'm talking to Jordan Grumet.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.760]   He's a hospice doctor whose passion for personal finance and storytelling
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.920]   has led him to educate others on living mindfully when it comes
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.640]   to money, time, and meaning.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.560]   As a hospice doctor, he's had an intimate look at people's regrets,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.920]   mistakes, and decisions at the end of life.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.800]   He's also the host of the award-winning podcast that I've had the pleasure
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.240]   of joining, Earn and Invest.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.360]   And he's got a new book, Taking Stock, a Hospice Doctor's Advice on
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.040]   Financial Independence, Building Wealth, and Living a Regret-Free Life.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   The book shares some of his advice about making the most at the end of life,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.120]   about our finances, our relationships, and our time.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.480]   Today, we're going to talk about what some of the biggest regrets people
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.480]   have are at the end of their life and what you can do to avoid them.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.480]   What Jordan calls the money mind meld and how to get away from focusing too
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.440]   much on money and not enough on the life you want, why the best financial
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.120]   plans are like a dining room table, why it's hard to talk about the issues
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.720]   of death, both with ourselves and our family members, why time perception
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.400]   work might be more useful than productivity hacks.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.120]   So without further ado, Jordan, welcome to the show.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.760]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.280]   I'm so excited for this conversation.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.480]   Yeah, me too.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.720]   So this isn't the first time we've talked about regret on the podcast.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.640]   Dan Pink and I talked about his book, which is all about regret.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.800]   Ben Nempton had a bunch of learnings about regrets of the dying that sparked
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.000]   him to totally change and upend his career and his life, but both of them
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.880]   approached it from surveys and data, which I'm sure you've read, but you've
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.040]   also sat down with thousands of patients at the end of their life and had these
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.960]   conversations.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.160]   So what have you learned that might not have come out in the data that many
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.840]   of us have heard?
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.440]   So in hospice care, when we're taking care of the terminally ill, it is a
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.480]   very normal thing for us to sit down with patients and talk to them about
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.960]   their lives.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.200]   We call it a life review.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.440]   So as opposed to a quantitative look, this is very qualitative.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.400]   We sit down with people and we ask what was important in your life.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   What did you achieve?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.200]   What didn't you achieve?
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.240]   What do you hope to achieve in the next few months?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.880]   What are some of your regrets?
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.440]   And the interesting thing about this is it's completely unstructured.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.040]   I mean, the questions we ask are somewhat structured, but above and beyond that, it
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.560]   gives people a chance to tell their stories.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.320]   And so this is where you get past the numbers and you start hearing about what
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.400]   people's lives were like, what they accomplished and what they didn't
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.000]   accomplish.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.960]   And so no surprise here, almost no one says, I wish I worked more nights and
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.360]   weekends.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.560]   Like I've never heard that with any of my patients.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.800]   Almost no one refers to certain economic goals.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.440]   No one says, I wish I hit a net worth of a million dollars, right?
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.120]   I only made it to 500,000 and really, I wish I made it to a million.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.760]   It is true that people have regrets when they're dying, if they don't have enough
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.320]   to cover some basic needs, but above and beyond that, it's a lot more about the
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.600]   things that were purposeful to them, that they never strive towards, that they
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.280]   never looked in the mirror and said, okay, life is finite.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.800]   I only have a certain amount of time on this earth.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.080]   And these are the real important things to me.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.960]   First and foremost, people don't want to spend time even thinking about what
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.920]   purpose and identity look like in their life.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.000]   So a lot of people don't even ask themselves the question because it's hard
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.520]   work and it's scary and the answers aren't simple.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.880]   Next, if people do kind of say, oh, you know, I really like to do this at some
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.160]   point, whether that's climbing Mount Everest or starting a certain hobby or
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.120]   writing that book, a lot of times we put it off.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.480]   We figure we're always going to have more time.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.600]   So what I get to experience when I talk to people is because death is around the
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.440]   corner, it relieves them of all society's expectations.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.880]   It relieves them all of family expectations.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.320]   They get to drop all the junk and look at their lives and say, what was important
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.720]   to me and did I accomplish it?
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.400]   And often those things are what I like to call the climb, right?
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.920]   There are things that have to do with what purpose is in our lives.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.880]   There are things that we're deeply interested in doing.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.720]   There are things that bring us happiness.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.440]   And often at the end of life, what people really regret is that they didn't spend
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.920]   enough time doing those things, right?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   They didn't write that book.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.720]   They didn't spend more time with those people who are important to them.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.560]   They didn't resolve that fight they had with their best friend from 20 years ago.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.840]   These are the kinds of things that really weigh on people.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.480]   And what happens is they really then have to try to catch up and achieve some of
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.080]   those things in whatever the weeks or months they have, right?
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   Can I get back in contact with this person and make amends?
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.440]   Maybe I wanted to go to climb Mount Everest.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.640]   I obviously don't feel good enough to do that, but maybe I want to try to make a
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.440]   trip to Nepal just to see it, right?
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.640]   What are the things we can do to try to bring some closure to these purposeful,
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.280]   meaningful things in our life that we never addressed?
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.360]   And I think that's what people really regret.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.920]   Interestingly enough, they don't regret failing you on your deathbed.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.440]   We'll sit there and say, you know what?
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.160]   I gave it my best and I didn't succeed.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.720]   I failed, but at least I tried.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.560]   It's the things that we never had the courage to try that I think really.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   Gets to us when we find out that we have a terminal on this.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.720]   In the book, you say living a regret-free life, but is it really more about assessing
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.520]   and tackling the regrets you've had than trying to completely avoid them?
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.280]   And is it about learning from them so that you can live more intentionally than
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.960]   trying to pretend that they don't exist?
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.000]   I think the problem is we often take these things that are deeply important to us and
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.040]   put them off, and maybe that's because we're trying to make money.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.600]   Maybe that's because we're trying to build a career.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.760]   Maybe, like I said, it's because they're scary and they're hard.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.680]   And so when we get to the end of this life and we haven't addressed these issues, we
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.760]   do feel regret.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.680]   I think if we can start thinking about these things much earlier, the regrets won't
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   form because then we can start taking action earlier in our lives today.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.880]   Not when we're on our deathbeds, not when we need that sudden plot twist that fixes
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.240]   everything. But in a sense, I think the way to avoid regrets is to start thinking about
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.880]   purpose and meaning now, because that's what people regret in the end is that they
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.120]   didn't address it earlier.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.720]   So, yes, when I'm 40, I can look back and say, hey, I really regret that I didn't
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.440]   think about these things when I'm 20.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.520]   But hopefully if you live to 70 or 80.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.600]   If you started thinking about these things at 40, you're not going to have a lot of
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.840]   regrets when you get to 60, 70 or 80.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.640]   So, yes, even in the middle of life, we have regrets and we can start addressing them.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.560]   But I think when we get towards the end of life and we start doing that life
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.800]   evaluation and we have to come face to face with our own mortality, if we think about
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.440]   these things earlier on, we are a lot less likely to have regrets.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.200]   You said they're hard conversations.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.960]   They're difficult. The question you just posed of what is my purpose?
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.840]   Like these are difficult things.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.520]   How would someone listening in their 20s, 30s or 40s start to approach to understand
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.880]   that, to process it?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.200]   Do you have suggestions?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.320]   Well, this is exactly why I found it so amazing that my life as a hospice doctor could
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.680]   start informing my life as a personal finance person and someone thinking about quality
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.440]   of life today.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.200]   I think the dying have a lot to teach us about how to look for purpose in life today,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.520]   decades and decades before we're going to deal with that kind of stuff.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.080]   With the dying, we do something called the life review, which, as I said, is the
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.560]   structured series of questions where people kind of look at their life, what was
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.040]   meaningful to them and did they pursue it?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.360]   I think we should start trying to do these life reviews way earlier.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.320]   Like we should probably do them yearly starting in our 20s.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.960]   I talk in the book exactly about how to go through a life review, but a quick exercise
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.200]   a quick visualization that I think any young person can do right now is to start with
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   the basic question.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.160]   If you were lying in your deathbed, bemoaning your life and thinking to yourself, I
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.720]   really regret that I never had the energy, courage or time to like whatever comes next
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.640]   in that sentence is germane to your sense of purpose.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.920]   And the sooner we start thinking about these things, the sooner we can start striving
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.640]   towards them now, as opposed to waiting to a later time.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.520]   There are all sorts of other exercises that you can do or questions you can ask
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.320]   yourself that start getting you working on this idea of purpose.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.720]   Now, one that I love to ask people, which is just so simple as like, when was the last
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.600]   time you woke up in the middle of the night with this idea and you were so excited you
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.520]   couldn't fall asleep?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.280]   Did you pursue that idea?
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.000]   Like how many times that happened in your life and what came of it?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.680]   Because those kind of things, too, are the messages to us of what our purpose is.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.080]   If that doesn't work, then you have to start doing other stuff.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.800]   Like I often tell people like you got to start saying yes to new experiences that you've
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.880]   never done before, right?
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.960]   People ask you to go do something that normally you'd say no to.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.160]   You have to say yes to people in places and things you've never done.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.600]   You have to start experiencing life and see what sticks.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.120]   It's like throwing spaghetti against the wall.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.440]   What ends up being meaningful to you?
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.160]   What brings you joy when you do it?
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.280]   And how can you then start building that as a bigger part of your life?
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   In the book trailer, you said your patients often die as they live.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.120]   You know, some express sorrow, hope, but it's a time of thoughtfulness.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.920]   It seemed the way you said that, like that was a revelation for you.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.960]   Did that change the way you lived when you process that thought and how has it?
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.320]   Well, so it's this interesting idea, right?
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.280]   People die as they live, and so people often ask me, like, is death painful?
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   Is it scary?
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.480]   How is it going to feel for me?
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.840]   So what I see in hospice patients is people who are anxious and uptight and unhappy in
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.200]   life tend to be anxious, uptight and unhappy in death.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.400]   And vice versa, people who are at peace, people who feel content, who have strong
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.120]   relationships and a sense and purpose in life tend to feel the same way in death.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.720]   So if the germane question is, how do I die a good death?
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.160]   The answer is, let's start working on living a good life.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.320]   So I think if we come to terms with some of these issues at a much younger age, the
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.920]   process of dying becomes a lot easier because you're a lot more at peace with what
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.880]   happened in your life.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.360]   So, yeah, it was kind of a revelation because it, again, made me start to look back and
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.520]   say, we're doing this too late.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.000]   We're having these conversations and thinking about these things when we're old and
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.240]   retired or getting a terminal illness.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.160]   And we should really be talking about these things in our 20s when we're setting off on
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.560]   our career journey and trying to decide what kind of life to build.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.880]   And someone listening to this right now might not think, oh, this is a personal finance
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.440]   conversation, right? It maybe hasn't gone there yet, but where I think a lot of people
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.240]   get held up is so much of your younger career is tied into
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.360]   earning, making money, progressing, and maybe for some people that is their passion,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.560]   maybe for others it's not.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.440]   How did all of these learnings kind of intersect for you with personal finance and
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.840]   come together to be the same conversation?
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.040]   So the problem is we're doing it all wrong.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   We're putting money first and then figuring out once we get our career and our money in
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.280]   order, we can start working on life.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.680]   My argument in this book and my argument from my experience as a hospice doctor and a
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.640]   personal finance expert is we need to put the money aside, especially when we're young,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.760]   just for a moment.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.040]   That doesn't mean we're going to stop working, that doesn't mean we're going to stop
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.120]   thinking about how we're going to build wealth, but we need to put those ideas aside and
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.080]   start thinking about purpose, identity, and connections first.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.200]   And the reason why is we make this mistake that money is the end goal, where my argument
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.160]   is money is a tool and money is a tool ultimately so that we can live lives of purpose,
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.400]   identity, and connections, right?
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.920]   The fire movement, financial independence, retire early.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.280]   We are all rushing, rushing, rushing to make enough money so we can stop working so we
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.880]   can do what?
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.520]   Live purposeful lives.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.360]   I'm trying to flip the switch and say, let's start with purpose, identity, and
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.840]   connections.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.680]   Let's start doing some of those exercises and the hard work and figuring out what that
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.560]   means.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:44.280]   And then once we're on that path, that's when you start looking at your finances and
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.640]   saying, how can I now build a path to financial independence or a financial structure that
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.800]   supports that purpose, identity, and connections?
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.680]   And that way we can be really intentional about why we make money, how we make money,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.040]   and what we're doing this all for.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:03.160]   When we don't do that purpose and identity work first, we are chasing after money as
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.680]   a goal, and often we don't even know why.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.360]   We get this idea of a certain net worth, we get this idea of a certain job position, and
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.240]   it sounds great, and it sounds meaningful.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.800]   But a lot of times when we get to that place, we get to that net worth, or we get to that
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.360]   job we were so excited about, we actually feel more depressed as opposed to happy.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.480]   And there's a few reasons for that.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.800]   One is because money is a little bit of a false goal.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.760]   Looking at your bank account isn't going to make you feel more purposeful or give you
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.040]   a better sense of identity.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.840]   So when you get to that place, you thought that was so great, like a million dollars
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.800]   in the bank, most likely two things are going to happen.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.000]   One, you're going to start saying, oh, well, I don't feel as good as I thought I'd feel.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.560]   Maybe I have to start going after 1.5 or 2 million.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.000]   So before you know it, you're right back on the treadmill trying to make more.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.240]   The other thing is this idea of loss aversion.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.320]   The fear of losing is almost twice as bad as the fear of never getting there in the
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:51.800]   first place.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.840]   The minute you get to that million dollar net worth, or you get to that job promotion
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.880]   that was so exciting, you start worrying about losing it.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.280]   Like, oh my God, the market's going to change.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.160]   Something's going to happen.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.560]   I'm going to have this big expense and all of a sudden I'm not going to have my million
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.600]   dollars anymore.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.400]   And that actually causes us to be more fearful than happy.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.960]   And I see this, especially in the financial independence movement.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.720]   When people get to financial independence, they get to that net worth number and they
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.680]   find themselves crushed, anxious and afraid.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.200]   And the reason why is because none of those things really have a real sense of purpose
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.000]   and identity.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.680]   There's no meaning in those things.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.000]   They're just these easy goals we set up.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.800]   And they're really easy because they keep us from doing the hard work of trying to figure
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.320]   out purpose and identity.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.720]   It's really easy to go for the low hanging fruit.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.680]   It's really comfortable.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.400]   It's what society expects of us.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.000]   We can go on Instagram and see all the pictures of people taking beautiful vacations and having
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.800]   beautiful things.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.000]   And it's really easy to strive for all that.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.760]   But in the end, I don't think it makes us happy.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.120]   And so that's kind of where I'm coming at this from.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.720]   That's why I realized when I started looking into personal finance, I started blogging
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.360]   and podcasting.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.640]   I was already financially independent.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.400]   So to me, it wasn't really exciting to go, OK, how do I invest?
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.120]   How do I save?
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.560]   How do I set up my 401k?
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.920]   I felt like those one-on-one conversations are important, but they weren't what I wanted
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.480]   to have.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.640]   I want to have those two-on-one conversations now that I'm starting to get a hold of my
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.280]   finances.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.080]   What do I do?
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.800]   But in having these conversations, I realized I was a little bit late to the game, like
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   my life would have been served much better if I had started thinking about what was purposeful
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.400]   first and then started building my financial framework.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.040]   Let's say we're all bought in with we need to figure this purposeful conversation out
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.080]   at the beginning.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.680]   Is that just the life review?
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.240]   Are there more steps to that process before if you've set money aside, bring it back into
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.120]   the conversation?
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   Or how long should someone expect it to take to figure that out?
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.320]   So I think figuring out your purpose and identity are things that take years.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.120]   But I actually suggest that people take a few months to really start doing some meditation,
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.240]   some thought and some of these purpose and identity exercises.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.960]   And we can go into some other ones like identity exercises if you want.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.720]   Once you start doing that and start saying, okay, these are the things in my life I feel
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.760]   that are important.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.920]   I think then it's fine to start looking at your financial structure and saying, okay,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.360]   I need to build a financial pathway, but let's see how I can at least take this idea of purpose
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.960]   and identity and build it into that.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.480]   So what kind of jobs am I doing?
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.600]   What's my end goal?
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.240]   What am I going to take this tool of money that I'm making and how am I going to use
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:23.880]   it?
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.920]   The important question is how are we going to, instead of deferring all of our gratification
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.360]   and spending all of our time front-loading the sacrifice and grinding it out to do well
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.080]   at work and make lots of money, the idea is how can we enjoy today and tomorrow, not just
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.920]   kind of put it off till later.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:44.520]   And so I think this happens simultaneously, but I think you need at least a few months
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.200]   of thinking about purpose and identity before you really start jumping into how you're going
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.720]   to change your financial life.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.920]   So in the book, you mentioned these three brothers, and one of them sounds like the
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.960]   one you just referenced, right?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   The eldest brother front-loads all this effort and work to enjoy all the fruits of his labor
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.160]   or her labor at the end.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.520]   The middle brother takes breaks along the way, like sabbaticals, and the youngest one
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.800]   just enjoys the journey.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.520]   When I read that, I thought, okay, well, there's multiple ways to enjoy this journey.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:15.000]   Is the message that all three ways could work or is the message that the first one is not
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.360]   really as good as it seems?
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.160]   The message is that all three ways could work.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:23.960]   So my hypothesis is once you start thinking about purpose, identity, and connections and
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.280]   start getting a hold of what those things are in your life, now is the time then to
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.720]   use that information to help you build a path towards financial independence.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.680]   The parable of the three brothers talks about three ways of doing it.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.200]   The eldest brother, which we talked about, was more front-loading the sacrifice, that
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.880]   traditional fire movement, grind it out, make it high net worth.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.920]   Once you hit that net worth, quit and let your money support you.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.320]   The middle brother was much more like the passive income and side hustles.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.880]   Financial independence wasn't some big net worth number.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.520]   It was actually making enough money through passive income and side hustles each month
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.440]   to pretty much support your needs.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.000]   And then the youngest brothers, the passion play.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.680]   This is the idea that if the goal of financial independence is to live a life of purpose,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.920]   identity, and connections, if you're lucky enough to come out of college or high school
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.600]   and find a job that fulfills your sense of purpose, identity, and connections, something
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.680]   you do, even if you weren't getting paid for, but you happen to get paid enough to cover
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.800]   your monthly needs.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.160]   In a sense, you're immediately financially independent, although you may work till 60
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.000]   or 70 because you're probably not saving a lot and you're just covering what you need.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.240]   Any of these three mechanisms, these archetypes are fine.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.520]   In fact, I argue that we may switch back and forth from time to time, or we might even
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.720]   borrow some of the different techniques of each of these brothers.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.840]   So when I look at my own trajectory, my father died when he was 40 and I was seven and he
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.960]   was a doctor.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.040]   And all I wanted to do was be a doctor like him.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.240]   I had no care about money.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.920]   So in a sense, I was very much a youngest brother.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.600]   I wanted to enjoy the past.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.720]   I thought that medicine would give me a sense of purpose, identity, and connections.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.880]   I could care less about money.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.480]   This is what I wanted to do with my life.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.280]   Something happened though.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.560]   I went to medical school residency.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.120]   I started practicing it and I burned out and I'm like, I can't live this life anymore.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.320]   But I also realized that to leave my job in medicine, I needed to build up a certain amount
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.280]   of money so that I could quit my job.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.960]   So I started grinding it out and doing things to make lots of money.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   So I transitioned from a youngest brother to an eldest brother, right?
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.400]   All of a sudden I was grinding it out, front-loading the sacrifice, making as much money as I could
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.560]   so I could quit and then find my sense of purpose, identity, and connections because
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.600]   I was done working.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.160]   But in the midst of doing that, I started picking up these little medical side hustles
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.600]   to make a little extra money on the side.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.800]   One of them was hospice.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.560]   Hospice was something that I really enjoyed that ended up being a side hustle.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.560]   So in a sense, I also took a little bit of the road of the middle brother.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.480]   Interestingly enough, hospice also became the thing I would do even if I wasn't getting
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.040]   paid for it.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.160]   So by doing the side hustle, I learned that I had a new passion.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.280]   So then again, I started back looking like a youngest brother.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:03.320]   The point is you can change from time to time to time, but those pathways need to be in
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.840]   service of your purpose and identity.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.200]   And the mistake that we make is we don't even consider purpose and identity a lot of times
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.760]   when we start going towards a career pathway.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:17.960]   We just zoom off into it thinking that we'll achieve some status of either wealth or position
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.760]   and that becomes what we think is meaningful or important to us.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.840]   And for a small subset of people, it may be.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.600]   But for the majority of us, all that does is delay the hard work.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:32.200]   Do you have an example of someone that you've met along this journey of writing the book
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.720]   and blogging and podcasting that kind of ran through this exercise maybe for a month or
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.440]   two of purpose and the kinds of changes that came after it?
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.760]   I mean, I did.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.840]   That's exactly what I did.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.040]   So what happened with me is I realized I was burning out of medicine.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.480]   I didn't want to be a doctor anymore.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.800]   I went to my accountant, my financial advisor said, "How much money do I need to retire
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.680]   early and start pursuing the life I want to pursue?"
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.280]   They gave me all sorts of cockamamie numbers that made no sense.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.880]   But eventually, Jim Dolly, the White Coat Investor, sent me his book to review for my
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.080]   medical blog.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.720]   And that gave me the vocabulary to understand financial independence.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.160]   And I realized I had enough money.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.240]   My net worth was high enough to actually leave work right away.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.040]   The problem was I hadn't done any of that purpose and identity work.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.040]   So I had no clue what I wanted to do with myself.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.720]   So I became depressed and anxious.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.680]   I didn't know what to do.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.320]   Like I could walk away from this identity that had been my whole life after my father
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.200]   died.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   But then who was I and what was life about?
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.360]   So instead of leaving work, I slowly started subtracting the things out of work I didn't
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.720]   like that were giving me friction.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.480]   But then I had to do the hard work of figuring out purpose and identity.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.400]   And I did a lot of the exercise in the book.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.240]   At that point, I was treating hospice patients.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.880]   And I was thinking about what has purpose for me.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:57.000]   I also started writing a blog where I daily wrote about finances and life and what they
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.400]   meant to me.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.400]   It was almost like an online diary.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.880]   And then I had to do the hard identity work.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.280]   What I suggest in the book is the great identity exercises to ask yourself or say the statement
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.520]   I am and then fill in the blank, right?
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.360]   So the first thing that came to my mind is I am a doctor, which is how I totally identified
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:12.920]   most of my life.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.040]   But then I realized that's just what I do for a living.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.640]   It's not all of who I am.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.640]   Eventually, I kept asking myself that question.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.360]   I am, you know, a father, a son, a spouse.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.120]   Okay, those are my family relationships.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.920]   I am a Plutus Award winner for the Yearning to Invest podcast.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.720]   That's an achievement.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.760]   But is it really who I am?
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.560]   After doing all this hard work, doing these exercises, I came to I am a podcaster, a public
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.320]   speaker, a writer, and that kind of coalesced into I am a communicator.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.120]   And that identity fit.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:48.760]   So now I had a sense of purpose was to have these great, amazing conversations where we
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.960]   talked about important things.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.440]   Identity was that of being a communicator.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.760]   And I had to get there before I could actually transition fully out of being a doctor and
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.680]   start subtracting more and more out of my job until I was left with the one thing that
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.960]   was still very purposeful for me, which was the hospice work.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.320]   So I've done this exact process.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:13.080]   The interesting thought when it comes to my career is when I started medical school, I
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.200]   actually volunteered in hospice the first week of my medical career.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.320]   So my first patient I ever saw was as a hospice volunteer.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.520]   Something in my chest was telling me hospice work is for you.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.520]   But instead, I ignored that.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.640]   And part of the reason I ignored it is because it wasn't as prestigious and it didn't make
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.640]   as much money as all the other things I could do.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:36.280]   But I go back now and I say, if I had understood purpose and identity, if I had done some of
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.600]   this hard work at a much younger age, I might have started my medical career in hospice
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.160]   and I probably would have never burned out.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.880]   And interestingly enough, I probably would have made a lot less money.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:51.000]   I probably wouldn't have made it to financial independence, maybe into my 50s and 60s, as
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.280]   opposed to now.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.880]   I kind of made it in my early 40s.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:59.400]   But I probably would have enjoyed my career more and it would have been an alternate pathway
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.040]   that probably would have saved me a lot of pain and anxiety that I got as I burned out
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.600]   in medicine when it wasn't really meeting my expectations.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.400]   So I had to do this work and I'm a perfect example of why putting purpose and identity
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.520]   first might have made my trajectory easier and less painful.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.960]   I feel like I have a similar experience where I meet people that have known me well and
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.520]   tell them that I started this podcast and they're like, "Yeah, you were supposed to
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.560]   do this 10 years ago."
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.880]   And I was like, "Well, why didn't you tell me 10 years ago?"
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.440]   It seems like everyone I know thought that this is what I should be doing, but somehow
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.120]   I was the last person to figure it out.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.840]   I don't remember if I read the exercise in the book, but sometimes I like asking other
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.760]   people who know you really well to talk about you because it was shocking to me that everyone
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.560]   thought I should be doing this before I knew it.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.080]   And I thought, "Man, if I could just have somehow interviewed them and asked them."
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.880]   So now, I regularly ask people that know me well, like, "What are things that you think
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.480]   that I should be doing more of?
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.960]   What are the things I'm doing that you wonder why I'm doing?"
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.600]   To try to pull that information out.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.640]   I mentioned that in the identity section in the book.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.800]   And if you're having trouble with the statement, "I am" and filling in the blanks, it's
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.400]   a great time to do exactly that.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.000]   Go ask family and friends and be aspirational.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Like, "Not only what am I today, but what could I be?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.720]   Like, what am I in my most heroic life?"
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.400]   And I think, again, those type of exercises, interviewing your family, say, "Well, how
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.840]   do you see me as?"
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.760]   It's very powerful because you're right, we ourselves have these blind spots.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:35.240]   And again, I think sometimes we spend a lot of our time pursuing things and worrying about
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.840]   what we think we're supposed to be doing as opposed to what we want.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.160]   And so, we do so little work trying to figure out what we want.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.640]   Again, the dying, it's amazing.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.480]   You find out you're dying and all of a sudden, all you can think about is what you want.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.560]   And so, I'm trying to bring some of that urgency a little earlier in our lives so that
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.440]   it can help guide us.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.680]   Science has shown that being charitable can actually have a huge impact on your happiness,
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.040]   which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.120]   They're a not-for-profit community built around a new modern way to give and they have
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:13.720]   a mission I think we can all get behind, helping people be more generous more often.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:18.040]   Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving because they offer an account that makes it
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.440]   easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.000]   You can make a one-time contribution or you can set a little aside each week or month
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.760]   and all your contributions are tax deductible, except you don't actually have to know exactly
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.920]   where you want to give the money right away.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.640]   In fact, you can make your tax deductible contribution now and invest that money into
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.240]   stocks or even crypto so it can grow tax-free and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   Then, whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more than 1.5 million charities,
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.520]   schools, or faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.680]   So, head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving today.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:04.200]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give to the
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.240]   charity of your choice.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.800]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   If you want to keep learning from the world's best minds anytime, anywhere, and at your
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.440]   own pace, you have to check out Masterclass, who I'm excited to partner with for this
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.240]   episode.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   With over 100 classes from a range of world-class instructors like Steph Curry, Richard Branson,
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.440]   and Martin Scorsese, that thing you've always wanted to do is way closer than you think.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.760]   When I signed up a few years ago, I jumped straight into an amazing cooking class by
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.280]   Thomas Keller that has totally leveled up my skills in the kitchen.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.880]   I also really enjoyed FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss' class on the art of negotiation.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.200]   And with every class I've taken, I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge the instructors
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.680]   have and the quality of the experience.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.520]   And a Masterclass membership makes such a good gift for someone that's hard to shop
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.000]   for.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.600]   I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.000]   Get unlimited access to every Masterclass.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.920]   And as an AllTheHacks listener, you get 15% off an annual membership.

[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:20.840]   Along the journey you shared for yourself, you talked about this trap that in the book
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.120]   you call "The Money Mind Meld", where you care way more about the money.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.800]   And I found myself in the same trap.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.160]   It's like, we got to get to this net worth.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.680]   We got to get to this net worth.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.440]   I recently read "Die With Zero" and I was like, maybe the net worth I'm really targeting
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.800]   is ending with zero.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.480]   Like, maybe the number doesn't matter.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.360]   But how did you get out of it?
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.440]   A lot of people that I think listen to the show, people that I know are optimizers stuck
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.000]   in that.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.440]   Can you talk about that transition?
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.500]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.440]   So, I talk about the money mind meld.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.600]   It's this idea that we become mesmerized with so much about money that especially when we're
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.640]   in the pursuit of it, it's the only thing we can see, right?
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.120]   We forget about everything else that's important to us.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:03.720]   The problem with the money mind meld is once you reach that goal, you get to that place
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.200]   that you thought was so vaunted, you don't find yourself happy.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.960]   And this is really what it comes down to.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.800]   Money doesn't really ultimately make us happy.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:19.560]   And so we have to change our mindset and really start thinking about money as a tool instead
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.440]   of a goal, right?
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.000]   Money itself does nothing for us, right?
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.480]   There are numbers on a computer screen or useless pieces of green paper if you happen
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.200]   to have cash.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.440]   But when you think about it, that doesn't mean anything.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.920]   What it means in society today is money is a currency, right?
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.640]   It's a storing of energy, potential energy.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.200]   It's a storing of goods and services.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.720]   So we can use that money to buy goods and services.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.760]   But what we're really talking about is freeing up our life with that money so we can pursue
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.520]   our sense of purpose and meaning.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.040]   That's all it really does for us.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:57.320]   So in order to really get past the money mind meld, you have to realize that money is not
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.200]   making you happy.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.480]   Money will solve your basic money problems, but nothing else.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.680]   And that money is a tool, one of many tools, right?
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.720]   So we have our youth.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.520]   We have our energy.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.560]   We have our intelligence.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.080]   We have our communities.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.600]   We have all these tools and all of these tools are in the pursuit of a goal of living a purposeful
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:14.920]   life.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:21.160]   We have to stop looking at money as the only tool or the goal and start realizing where
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.040]   it fits.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.600]   One of the ways I really tell people is, you know, think about what happens when you reach
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.560]   that money goal.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.720]   How will you feel?
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.280]   And at first people like, oh, I'd be so excited and happy.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.200]   And then you kind of say, well, what next?
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.520]   What would you do?
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.800]   What would that money get you?
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.160]   Why would your life be better because of that?
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:41.640]   Right?
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.520]   And so on some level, people are going to say, I could take that great vacation or I
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.800]   could fly first class.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.040]   But when you really drill down, you realize that those things aren't truly the key to
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:50.520]   happiness.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.880]   Like they're nice perks, right?
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.720]   But they're not the true key to happiness.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.320]   So then you start pushing further and saying, okay, what would this really allow you to
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:57.480]   do?
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.640]   And if people are really thoughtful, they'll eventually get to this point where they're
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.320]   like, it'll allow me to do this thing.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.360]   I always wanted to do that.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.680]   I was so scared that I never had time.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.760]   And then you start saying, well, why couldn't you do those things now?
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.840]   Like, is it really money that's holding you back?
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.000]   And what you realize is that money often becomes an excuse, right?
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.640]   Yes.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.760]   If you had all the money in the world, you could stop working completely.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.120]   And that would give you a certain amount of more time to pursue things.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.000]   But most people realize that when they actually get a hold of what's purposeful and has meaning
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.760]   for them in their life, they could start bringing those things into their life now.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.880]   And that the money is just an enabler.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   But again, we have some of these other enablers.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.800]   And when you only focus on the money, a lot of times when we get to that point where we
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.360]   have enough money, instead of actually allowing it to enable us, it makes us more fearful.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.840]   And we either go for more money because we don't know what the heck we want to do with
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.160]   our lives.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.760]   Or we just get afraid that we're going to lose it.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.280]   This is part of my gripe with the fire movement.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.120]   Now, I'll caveat.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.560]   So I was in a documentary on it, playing with fire.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.080]   I'm guessing you've seen it because a lot of the community has watched it.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.480]   If anyone hasn't, I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:13.320]   But in the recent past, especially through your book, I really struggle with the RE part.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   Like this idea that we should get all this money so that we can stop working and just
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.640]   kind of do nothing or travel or whatever it is.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.720]   And I think the word retirement is too messy.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   Many people I think say, "Oh, retirement.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.840]   No more work."
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:34.280]   For me, I think if we could reframe that concept as financial independence is just when money
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.200]   lets you do the thing you want to do.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.120]   And if you're already doing it, then you already are.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.640]   Like you said, if you had been a hospice doctor from the beginning, maybe you had been financially
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.480]   independent out of medical school.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.560]   Or maybe once you paid your medical bills, but maybe not.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:51.000]   And so, that stresses me out thinking about people trying to have this goal of just doing
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:51.480]   nothing.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.880]   How do you feel about that RE part of the movement?
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:00.520]   I think that was both the greatest thing for the movement because it made it exciting and
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.840]   fun to talk about, but also the most detrimental to the real message.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.280]   Because the real message is not retire early.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.880]   Most of us got here because we actually enjoy some kind of work.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.080]   And I think we find purpose in work.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.960]   The point being is that what really matters is not whether you're working or not.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.560]   Because I think we work most of our lives.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.880]   And I think most of us enjoy doing some kind of work.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.200]   It's more about the autonomy and the mastery and the independence.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.520]   All those things that make us feel good about work.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.040]   I think that's what, when we're talking about retiring early, we're not really talking about
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.600]   not doing things.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.760]   We're talking about reclaiming our control of doing things that make us feel good.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.320]   Those things may actually create money.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.200]   Often they do or create some kind of content or product, right?
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.680]   We build something, we make something, we write something.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.960]   This is all very important to our sense of identity and our sense of waking up in the
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.600]   morning and feeling like we have something productive and exciting to do.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.600]   But what we're really looking for is control.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.120]   Control and independence.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.480]   And so, it's really, you get to financial independence and then you have control of
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:11.080]   what type of work you do, when you do it, and what the end goal of that work is.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.560]   And that's something that most people feel is lacking in traditional employment today.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:22.040]   I would challenge anyone listening that feels like they want to achieve this fire journey
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.760]   goal to stop worrying about trying to save enough that you could stop working for the
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.640]   rest of your life.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.960]   I think what you said about people often end up being able to monetize whatever they would
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.680]   do if they stopped working is very true.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.960]   So, I try to challenge people to say, "What if you just took a year off, did the thing
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.840]   you love?"
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.320]   I think for a good number of people, not everyone, but for a good number of people they'd find
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:47.480]   within a year, that thing that they love actually does generate income.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.560]   And all of the math of, "Oh, I need to save enough to live on 4%."
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.880]   Well, that's true if you're not working.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.200]   But that goal of maybe if you're on the coast, maybe you think you need $10 million, but
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.400]   if you take a year off, find out that the thing you love doing makes more than $0, well,
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.040]   then the amount you actually need to do that full time could be half of what you need.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   It could be nothing because it makes enough money to sustain your lifestyle.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:19.000]   So, I think that far too often we assume that in retirement, we make no money, when in reality,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.160]   if your retirement is just doing something you would do for free, many of us can get
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:27.080]   paid to do that thing also and it changes the entire equation.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:32.840]   When I have these conversations, I want to be really clear about this because people
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   look at my story and even probably your story, a lot of our stories and people say, "Well,
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.960]   duh, it's really easy to say that when you have money, right?
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.280]   You have space, you've made money, you have savings, you have investments, it's really
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.560]   easy for you to say these things, but I'm a 22-year-old out of college, I have just
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.880]   enough money to cover my rent, I'm barely putting food on the table, you know, it might
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.600]   be easy for you, but for me, I don't have time to do all this stuff."
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.840]   And this is the conversation I really want to have, right?
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.920]   Because again, it's easy for us in our 40s and our 50s when we have some savings to start
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.160]   talking about meaning and purpose and side hustling and monetizing things so that we
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.680]   can stop doing what we don't like.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.560]   But, you know, the 20-year-olds, the people who are struggling to put money on the table
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.240]   are looking at us and saying, "Yeah, that's a real privileged version of life that we
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:17.720]   don't have."
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.440]   But I want to start thinking about those people too, because I think it's really important.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:29.480]   We talk about money as if it is the and only tool, but the truth of the matter is we have
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.760]   lots of tools that help us live a purposeful and meaningful life.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.720]   So, if you are 22, you just got out of school or you didn't go to school and you're just
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.280]   working that eight to six, barely getting by.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.360]   And you're like, "I don't have space in my life for side hustles.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.800]   I don't have space in my life for these things."
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.200]   I would like to look at those people and say, "Well, money is one tool.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.040]   But again, you have other tools.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.240]   You've got your energy.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.280]   You've got your youth.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.960]   You've got your communities.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.400]   You've got your skills.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.360]   So, maybe you work your eight to six Monday through Friday.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.520]   And then on Saturday night for three hours, pick something you're really passionate about
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.200]   and start a side hustle, right?
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.440]   Three hours on a Saturday.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   Let's see what happens with this in six months.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.080]   If after six months, you've been doing this passionate side hustle three hours every Saturday
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.840]   and you make zero money from it, guess what?
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.480]   You still just added purpose into your life by doing something you like and you're passionate
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:19.720]   about.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.040]   So, you've won even if you haven't made any money.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.480]   But let's say you were lucky enough to make a little money doing this side hustle.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.760]   You used your tool of energy, which I don't have in my 50s.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.720]   I've got kids.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.760]   I'm busy.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   I don't have nearly as much energy, but you're in your 20s.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.600]   So, you have a little more energy.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.760]   You use that tool of energy instead of the tool of money.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.800]   You created the side hustle.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.560]   The side hustle made a little money.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.240]   You hate your eight to five.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.960]   Maybe it becomes a nine to five.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.600]   Or maybe it becomes a four day a week instead of a five day a week.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.880]   And then because you have a little more energy now and you're really liking that side hustle
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.280]   because you're passionate about it, you keep building it out.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.400]   Maybe in three or four years, it's covering 50% of your income and you drop your job even
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.960]   further.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.360]   Or maybe it allows you to go to a job that you make a little less, but you like doing
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.240]   it a lot more.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.520]   So the point is, how do we use purpose to create space in our life?
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:20.360]   How do we use all these other tools we have, including money, to start being more thoughtful
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.200]   about what we're doing with our time now?
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.760]   So you and I can look as we get older, as we have more money and say, OK, now we have
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.360]   this tool of money to get us to this place where we have more control.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.960]   But I'd like younger people also to start thinking about ways they can take more control
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.800]   too of the lives they're living so they don't get caught in that rut where they're 40 or
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.160]   50 and they have tons of money, but they've never really spent any time thinking about
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.440]   what's really meaningful to them.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.360]   So you mentioned money is a tool.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.800]   It's an important tool.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.680]   I do want to spend some of the conversation to talk about that tool.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.160]   You spent a lot of time in the book talking about financial planning and after you do
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.080]   the hard work about how to do it.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.600]   And I like this idea of bringing something fun to the conversation.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.960]   So it's a dining room table.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.480]   You said it's not a flamingo.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.760]   It's not a three legged stool.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.560]   Talk a little bit about what that is.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.920]   What is the financial plan to you?
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.960]   Because I think as someone who started a financial planning company, it can be a big thing that's
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.200]   daunting, that is complicated and takes hours and hours to go through.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   Or you can kind of think about it in a more simple framework like I think you present.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:25.560]   So the idea is, you know, the American table, the dining room table is an institution in
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.200]   our country, right?
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.040]   This idea that the family sits around it.
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.680]   And I like it as a model for how our financial plans should be because it's stable, right?
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   It's hard to knock over a dining room table.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.040]   It's solid, well built, and it supports us.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.240]   And I think we should look at our financial plan the same way.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.000]   So a lot of people build a financial plan that looks a lot like a flamingo, right?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.960]   Think about a flamingo.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.000]   They've got their one leg.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.600]   They're incredibly unstable.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.120]   Anything could knock them over.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:54.040]   This is a person who really puts all their eggs in one basket, right?
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.480]   They have their W2 job.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.760]   They work for some company.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:03.000]   And maybe if they do invest at all in stock, maybe it's through their 401K.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.240]   Maybe it's actually in that company itself.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.600]   And so everything depends on this one company.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.240]   And God forbid, a la Enron, this company goes down, something happens to it.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.520]   The flamingo is incredibly easy to knock over.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.800]   So then you can think about a two-legged table or stool.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.680]   Still not that stable, but a little bit better.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.080]   That might be someone who has a W2 job.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.080]   And maybe they now have a 401K with some broad-based index funds, right?
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.360]   Or maybe some bonds.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.600]   So again, a little bit more stability, but still not perfect.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.480]   And then we start thinking, how can we even make it more stable?
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.520]   Like a three-legged stool.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.720]   Now, maybe we add in a side hustle or some real estate, right?
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.000]   And so then again, we're now creating more space.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.320]   And then the four-legged dining room table, something that even if you knock a leg off
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:56.120]   is still going to be incredibly stable is your W2 job plus the broad-based index funds,
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.920]   plus some real estate, plus a side hustle.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.000]   Maybe if you're excited about some alternatives, you have a little crypto here or there.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.880]   Again, the idea is you're creating these different legs.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.480]   It's this idea of a diversification, but it makes it a little bit more obvious.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:17.000]   And again, the whole point of this is really what we want to do is we want to build a financial
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.600]   plan that supports our sense of purpose, identity, and connections.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.040]   We want to build meaning into our life.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.160]   To do that, we build a stable financial plan, and then we practice risk medication, right?
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.960]   What we're really doing is trying to protect ourselves against the unknown risks, like
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.640]   you suddenly lose your job, like an economic downturn, like a healthcare crisis or problem.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.200]   Like all of these things, we want to create that dining room table that's going to support
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.520]   us so that we can withstand whatever trauma, whatever black swan, or I call them white
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.720]   swan events that happen, right, these events that a black swan event is a totally unexpected
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.120]   event that can really ruin our financial lives.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.120]   White swan events are events that can ruin our financial lives, but they're not totally
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.200]   unexpected, like a healthcare problem, right?
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.440]   People get sick and end up spending a lot of money on healthcare.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:02.840]   It's common.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.320]   A divorce, right?
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.800]   The whole point of all this is to build a solid financial foundation so you can mitigate
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   your risk and withstand the winds of change that are going to affect you and your financial
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.840]   plan so that you can continue using that money to do what it's supposed to do, which is give
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.840]   you the space and time to do meaningful things.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:28.600]   So at its core, would it be fair to say a lot of times people think of the financial
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.760]   plan as what do I do with my savings?
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.480]   And your point is, you have your income, you have your savings, but then you might also
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.320]   have some other assets you own, whether it's a business, whether it's real estate, and
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.680]   you might also have not just your job, but your other income.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:48.040]   And the more you can start to build different buckets of money that aren't just your savings,
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.400]   the more stable you can be.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.960]   You mentioned the dining room table was four.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.320]   At some point, maybe you don't need your 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.440]   Like if you can get four, which if one falls off, three is still a little stable, four
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.640]   kind of solid pieces of financial wealth, if you will, whether it's a job or that's
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.080]   kind of a place to strive for.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   Yeah, and perfect is the enemy of good.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:14.040]   I love these posts on social media where you have someone in the personal finance world
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.680]   that says, I've got nine forms of income, and they love to say the different side hustles
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.640]   and the difference.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.440]   That's great.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:26.440]   But for the majority of us, four or five revenue streams that are stable, that are diversified,
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.840]   that are uncorrelated, like I don't want to go too far, but how can we start building
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.680]   these streams and be thoughtful about it, right?
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.320]   So, OK, I'm going to retire.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.440]   Do I have a pension?
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.560]   Do I have a 401(k) that I can start taking distributions from?
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.760]   Do I want to set up an insurance policy that'll pay me like a spia?
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.400]   There are different ways of doing this so that when one revenue stream drops off, you
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.920]   can create another revenue stream.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.960]   And therefore, again, you can protect yourself from change because that's ultimately we have
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.160]   no control over change.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.400]   We have only control over the best planning we can do and then what we do with our lives.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.680]   So that's the planning piece.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:06.600]   But you do talk a little bit about how one of the ways to tackle your finances is to
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.240]   spend less.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.040]   A lot of these tactics are, OK, you can get a side hustle, you can make more.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:15.080]   But you talk about not just trying to do the small things, but really building that kind
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.960]   of savings frugality mindset into your daily life.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.960]   Can you share some examples of how you've done it and how people might do that to make
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.200]   their finances a little more automated in terms of how they save for the future?
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.640]   Yeah, you know, there's some tips in the book about just simple things.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.000]   I especially talk about it when I talk about budgeting, because I think budgeting is something
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.440]   that people really struggle with.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.120]   And my family has never been a good spreadsheet budgeter.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.680]   So there's great apps nowadays and you can do all sorts of spreadsheets on budgeting.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:50.920]   But I think there's some really easy things you can do that help streamline your budget
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.400]   to make sure that you're not spending frivolously.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.880]   So with my wife and I, we were lucky enough to both be employed and have two decent jobs.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:03.000]   So a basic rule for us is we lived always off of one salary and the other salary went
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.840]   directly into either savings accounts or into investment accounts with us not even seeing
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.400]   them.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.040]   So it was as easy as you want to buy something.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.920]   There's either money in that checking account or there isn't.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:20.280]   We took half this money off the table before we even had a chance to think about it.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.640]   So simple things like that.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.880]   Other little things, you don't have this as much today, but it used to be back in the
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.960]   day, if you wanted to buy something from a vending machine or something, you had to have
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.840]   the money on you, right?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.720]   You used to have to have cash.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.440]   It was before the days where we all had phones and we could just hold our phone up to the
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.000]   vending machine.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.720]   So an easy thing I did is I never carried cash.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.160]   Some people never carry credit cards.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.280]   It's like, okay, I'll have my one safety credit card, but I'm not even going to give myself
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.240]   the means to spend.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:51.080]   Other things you can do is like, we rarely make big purchases on a whim or on a spur.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.240]   So if we're at Target or if we're at some place and we see something that's $500 or
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:00.360]   even $250, we're unlikely to go buy at the moment we see it and think we need it.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.880]   So often there's a cooling off period, especially with something new that we want to buy, where
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.880]   we give ourselves a week to think about it, just to make sure we truly need and want this
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.120]   thing.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:12.920]   I think there are a bunch of other different hacks we can use.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.400]   We can automate, we can, again, make sure that our money is going right out of our paycheck
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.960]   into things like our 401k so we don't even see it.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.440]   But I always say with savings that you can only squeeze so much water out of a stone,
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:24.680]   right?
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.080]   There's only a certain amount of movement we can make there.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.240]   And it doesn't make sense to squeeze so hard that life is painful.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.200]   If you have the choice, right?
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.960]   If you don't have the choice, you don't have the choice.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.800]   But if you have the choice, you don't want to squeeze so hard that you're not enjoying
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.160]   your days and that you're suffering.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.960]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.760]   I get it.
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.800]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.440]   hang.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:59.560]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.040]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.920]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.680]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:11.000]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.640]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:18.280]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:23.160]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.400]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.360]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.520]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:39.720]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.480]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.360]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.440]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.400]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:59.000]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.800]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.760]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.080]   So I'm going to transition a little bit here.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.440]   We talked about our personal finances as people listening, thinking about it.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:23.800]   But another important thing is thinking about others' finances, especially the legacy you
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.160]   leave, the legacy your family leaves.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.320]   You intentionally don't use estate planning as much as financial legacy documents.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.080]   So I'd love to hear that story because I think it makes it a little easier.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:37.880]   But how do you think people should approach that as well as the conversation with their
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.960]   loved ones who maybe aren't thinking about it?
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:45.640]   I think when we talk about estate planning, it's this big, scary idea, and it's really
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.440]   easy to put that off or not pay attention to it because it seems so complicated.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.600]   And again, let's not forget when we're talking about estate planning, what we're really talking
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.480]   about is what's going to happen when we or our loved one dies.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.320]   And no one likes to talk about that, right?
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.280]   Because you start thinking about what's going to happen when this important person is gone.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:08.120]   I like to talk about our legacy documents instead, because as opposed to thinking about
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.760]   when someone's gone and no longer with us, I like to approach it as this is the way you're
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.440]   going to stay positively in people's lives, right?
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:21.720]   By planning appropriately, by doing these financial legacy planning or the financial
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:27.400]   legacy documents or the medical legal legacy documents, this is so that your impact remains,
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.800]   that you still affect those people you love and that even God forbid when you die or a
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:37.480]   family member dies, that that positive effect is still out there in the world for years
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.280]   and years later.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.120]   So this is your mark on the world.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.760]   But it's a difficult conversation to have.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.760]   And I especially think for people in our age group, a lot of us are in that sandwich generation
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.440]   where we have young kids, but we also have parents who are getting older.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.840]   And I'm dealing with this right now with my in-laws who are currently moving.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:01.720]   It's really hard to talk to your parents about money issues in your money situation.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:07.000]   So in the book, I talk about a few tactics that help you start these conversations.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.560]   In a way that's non-confrontational.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:15.000]   So one of my favorite ways to start these conversations is you ask for advice, right?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.280]   So people are very open to having us ask them for advice.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.680]   So let's say you actually understand this legacy planning yourself.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.120]   You actually have a good hold on it, but you want to start broaching it with your parents.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:30.040]   The easiest way to say, look, I was thinking about doing a will and maybe a trust.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.360]   Mom and dad, what did you guys do?
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.880]   Like, what should I do with this?
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.720]   It's kind of foggy in my mind.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.840]   I don't know what to do.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.880]   It's a really great way of assessing where your parents are,
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.040]   because then they're going to feel like they're giving you advice.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.080]   So they're going to be open.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.760]   They're not thinking you're like, mom, dad, when you die, what am I going to get of yours?
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.720]   That's not what you're asking them.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.520]   You're saying, I need to do this for my family.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.960]   You know, what should we do?
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:56.040]   It's a great way to broach the subject and get a feel for how much thinking they've done on this.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.320]   You may find that they've done tons of thinking about it.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.480]   They have their wills and their trust, and they can actually tell you and help you do it yourself.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.880]   Or they might look at you and say, hmm, we've never thought about this before.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.040]   And that's a perfect chance to say, well, I'm doing it.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.160]   You want to do this together?
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.120]   It's a great way to start the conversation.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.640]   That's one way to do it.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.040]   Another way I really like to broach the conversation is being in hospice.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.480]   I've seen some real tragedies.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.800]   So it's easy for me to approach my parents and say,
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:30.760]   I was taking care of this guy and his mom was sick and she had Alzheimer's.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   And the dad had taken over everything, the medical power of attorney.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.800]   He had taken over the finances for the family.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   My patient, he was really happy.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.080]   His parents were managing all these things because his mom was getting sick and he just
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.440]   wanted to be with his mom.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:48.120]   Then COVID came along and all of a sudden his dad got sick and was on a ventilator.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.480]   And guess what?
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.600]   I didn't have the financial power of attorney.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:57.160]   My patient couldn't pay for his mom's needs because his dad was on a ventilator.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.440]   And he didn't have any rights to all the financial paperwork,
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.280]   to the checking account, to any of that.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.680]   So I've experienced these things.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.120]   And I could go to my parents and say, you know what?
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.280]   The funniest thing happened to one of my patients.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.080]   Tell that story and say, gosh, I hope that kind of thing doesn't happen to us.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:17.800]   And so by talking about how other people have had these bad experiences,
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.320]   it's a wonderful way to actually breach the conversation with your loved ones.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.120]   And it's a real non-confrontational easy way.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.320]   So that's another way to do it.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.560]   And the last way I really like to do it is to talk about it in terms of legacy.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:33.000]   So instead of saying, when you die, who's going to get what stuff of yours
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.200]   to go to your parents and say, you know what?
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.440]   My kids are young.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:45.880]   And I, as well as I want my kids to really remember you the way you are after you're gone.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.080]   Let's talk about how you want to be remembered.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.480]   What do you want the kids to have of you?
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.840]   What do you want them to remember?
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.880]   What is your legacy?
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:59.080]   And a lot of times that leads to talking about things, even like property, like mom and dad.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:05.080]   Every year we take all the grandkids and we go to that cabin that you guys own in Wisconsin.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.800]   After you die, what should be done with that?
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.120]   Like, do you want us to still do that and think of you every year when we go do this?
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.240]   Do you want us to sell it?
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.160]   What would you want done with this thing?
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.880]   But by framing it in terms of their legacy,
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.040]   I think then you can open up a difficult conversation
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:27.080]   and make it about celebrating the people we're talking about.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.120]   Because the idea behind this, and no one thinks of it this way, but
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.280]   really estate planning should be a celebration of people's lives, right?
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.480]   We should celebrate with their medical legacy planning, like
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   living will, medical power of attorney.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.760]   What we're doing is we're celebrating their dignity and what they want
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.600]   done for them when they can't speak for themselves.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.160]   With their financial legacy documents, like their wills and their trust,
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:56.680]   we're celebrating all they've achieved economically, all the things they've acquired,
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.480]   and how those things are going to continue in the world after they're gone,
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.320]   and they're going to stay present in our lives.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.880]   So, if we can reframe this as a celebration,
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.960]   it makes it much more approachable and it makes the conversations much easier.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.320]   - You just gave me an idea, which I think is really interesting.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.400]   So, two things came from this when I was just listening.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:17.400]   One, something I want to make sure my wife and I do is,
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.760]   and I wish that we had done with my grandparents,
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.960]   is take some time to capture who they are, their story,
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.080]   whether that's on video, whether that's written, so you have something to share.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.880]   So, that's just something that's top of mind for me is,
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:36.120]   I saw Sean, I think from My First Million, posted that he did a podcast with his mom,
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.840]   where he interviewed his mom like he was doing an interview.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.200]   But he didn't publish it, right?
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.600]   He didn't go out and share it with the world.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.000]   He just did it because he wanted to have an archive of a conversation he had.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.080]   So, that was one, which I thought was just really interesting,
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.040]   was trying to document these people that are important in your lives
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.560]   that won't be there forever.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:58.840]   But the other is talking about ways that you could keep alive things.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.800]   So, in your case, there's an actual physical cabin, right?
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:05.080]   That might be something that's a lot easier and tangible.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.880]   But if your family has really loved going to a cabin, but always renting it,
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:13.480]   maybe you could ask your parents, if you have money left over,
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.440]   yeah, you could give it to someone.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.800]   But is there anything you want to do with it?
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.720]   You think about people with tons of money and they grant these scholarships,
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.200]   so kids could go to school under a program.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.920]   Or I remember my sister's college, someone donated a pool of money
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.240]   and the whole purpose of it was, it was enough money that the interest on the donation
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.240]   would be able to buy a passport for every kid at the university that never had one.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.760]   And I thought that was so cool.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.200]   And I'm now thinking, oh, if I have money when I die,
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   I would love to not just leave it, but also leave a purpose for it.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.520]   I would love you to take this money and take a trip every year
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.840]   like we took when we were kids, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.560]   So, trying to talk about this with your parents,
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.920]   but maybe to turn their legacy into something tangible
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.080]   that you can bring to life with your family
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.440]   and can be passed on is a really interesting idea that I'd never thought about.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.840]   I think our lives are like a stone being dropped in the ocean.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:11.640]   We are here for so little time and once we break the water, we're gone.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:17.640]   But the ripple effect of that stone can carry on for miles and miles and miles.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:23.480]   And so, a lot of the thought is, what is going to be the ripple of my life?
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.600]   And so, I'm convinced that living this life of meaning and purpose
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:31.640]   is going to affect those people around you by thinking about your legacy planning,
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.360]   by setting aside money to do those important things,
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.400]   that's going to be your ripple that will carry on after you're gone.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.040]   And I personally find that extremely comforting.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:47.320]   I imagine those in their final days would find it comforting to know that
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:51.960]   what they care about is going to kind of transcend their own life into others.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.600]   Yeah, totally. I mean, it's about legacy and that's why I think we should call it legacy planning.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.400]   Are there any things that you think are commonly missed in legacy planning that
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:05.880]   aren't as daunting to go tackle as maybe an entire estate plan or maybe you've done that?
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:08.920]   Things that you're like, "Hey, even if you think you've done it,
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.360]   make sure to think about X or Y or Z that might not be the obvious."
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.920]   I hate to say it and it's so estate planning 101, but it's so straightforward.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.040]   Everyone needs to go check their beneficiaries.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:25.560]   You need to of all your policies and you need transfer on death for all your bank accounts.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.400]   Right? It's just such an easy thing to do
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:33.880]   that everyone forgets to do and it can save you a huge amount of hassle.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.520]   I talk about in the book and I actually interviewed someone on my podcast
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:42.760]   whose husband died and they were both very young and he never changed the beneficiary on his life
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.760]   insurance policy because he had set it up a decade earlier and he had an ex-girlfriend's name on it.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.760]   And think about how painful and difficult that could be.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.320]   A life insurance policy is supposed to, God forbid,
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:58.280]   you die, it's supposed to make your family's life easier and then you find out that this
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.680]   money is all set to go to a stranger. Lucky enough, the stranger in this case
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.360]   transferred the money over to the true beneficiary, to the person's wife.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:11.480]   But these are easy things and we forget to do them.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:16.760]   So do the easy things first and then we can start looking at the wills and the trusts and the big
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:21.640]   stuff. But do the easy things first. One thing that really resonated with me in
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:26.600]   Silicon Valley where lots of people have earnouts and golden handcuffs is this one more year syndrome.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:33.400]   So the one more year syndrome is - the idea is that it becomes really easy to convince yourself
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:38.040]   to put off doing the hard work, to pursuing a life of real meaning and purpose for you
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:42.440]   because you're just going to stick around one more year so the things are a little more solid.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:46.360]   So your net worth goes up a little bit more. So you have insurance for one more year.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.840]   You start convincing yourself, "Hey, this job isn't so bad. I don't love it. It's easy to
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:56.120]   stick around." And a corollary to that is the what-if syndrome. What if the stock market drops?
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:00.600]   What if I have a healthcare crisis? What if all these bad things happen the minute I leave my job?
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:06.120]   And so what this allows us to do is to stay in jobs that we don't like, that aren't fulfilling
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:12.280]   a sense of purpose or meaning for us. And years turn into decades and we still haven't left.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:18.440]   It's like it allows us to put off doing the hard work and it becomes an excuse.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.760]   And so we do this because we don't want to do the real hard work. Life is finite,
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.400]   time is finite and at some point you run out of years. And especially when you get to the end,
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.080]   you really will wish that you would utilize those years instead of sticking around at a
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.440]   job you really didn't need. Any help for someone struggling with that right now of how do I
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:41.480]   stop worrying and get out when I feel like it's the right thing but I keep saying one more year?
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:48.040]   So what I've done and what I certainly did in my career is instead of taking the full plunge
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.840]   of just going from working full-time being a doctor to not being a doctor at all, I started
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.920]   just subtracting out stuff I didn't like at work. So I took the middle ground. I just said, okay,
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.280]   let's look at all the things in my job I don't like and start getting rid of them. So can you
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.960]   go part-time? Can you go half-time? Can you get rid of the clients you don't like anymore?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:09.000]   Can you hire someone out within your job to do all the things you don't like and just spend
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.640]   the time doing things you do like? How can we bring more purpose even within that work setting?
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.160]   That's one way. The other way is to just at some point bite the bullet and say, you know what?
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.680]   If I leave my job and I don't like what's happening, I can always go back to work.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:27.480]   And for a lot of people, they can. And so a lot of times you have to turn it around
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:35.400]   and stop saying, what if this bad thing happens? And start saying, what if I don't have that much
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.440]   time left? Like people worry about running out of money, but what if you run out of life?
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.320]   And I think when you start framing things in those terms, they realize that yes,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.320]   if your finances are iffy, maybe you do need one more year, but if it's pretty clear cut and you're
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:56.120]   like, this is pretty good, realize that life and time are finite. And the only thing we can control
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.960]   is what we spend doing in those time units, those little slots of time we have, you are specifically
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.800]   choosing to do something you don't like in that time slot for no other reason than it's easy.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.360]   And so, how can we change that mindset?
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:15.080]   A lot of the purpose of this entire conversation has been around the fact that there is some
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.840]   finite amount of time. And some people find out it's less than they thought. Some people have a
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.320]   lot of it, but even when you have a lot, the days, the weeks, the months, they always feel like you
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.560]   don't. And you have a whole section of the book about time perception and the way you think about
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.840]   time is really important in a well-rounded life. So, I'm curious what some of the best ways people
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.800]   should approach their time differently or alter that perception to be happier and to live that
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:45.400]   well-rounded life. In personal finance, we always talk about time as if it's a commodity, right?
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:51.080]   You can buy it, you can sell it, you can trade it. Nothing is farther from the truth. Time passes no
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:56.280]   matter what we do. We have no control. We don't know how much time we have on this earth, right?
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.680]   We don't know if it's 50 years or 80 years or 70 years. We don't know, but that's out of our
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   control mostly, right? We can exercise, we can do a few things, but we've got a set amount of time
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:10.440]   on this earth that time passes and you can't do a thing about it. So, there are really two choices
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.880]   here. If you look at time as a series of time slots, because it's just easier, days, weeks,
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.920]   months, hours, however you want to look at it, we can try to control the activities we place in
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:27.800]   those time slots or we can try to mess with our perception of time and that's it, right? So,
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.680]   when it comes to what activities we place in those time slots, this gets back to trying to figure out
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.560]   what's purposeful to us and then building a financial life around it so that we can fill up
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:43.240]   as many of those time slots as possible with things that are purposeful to us and subtract
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.680]   out as many as possible of those things that have no meaning or give us friction, right? So, that's
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.840]   the one thing we can do and that's what the book is mostly about is learning to bring more purpose
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.360]   in your life, whether you have money or not, but then ultimately bringing money as a tool to even
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.680]   help you do that further. That's point one. Then we can mess with the perception of time and this
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.160]   is a little bit harder to understand. There are all these sayings that kind of touch on this idea
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.160]   but aren't clear about it, like when you have kids, you say the days are long but the years
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.560]   are short. We always talk about this idea that when you're young, time lasts forever, but when
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:22.840]   you're old, time flies by. The point about thinking about this is just if we know how we feel about
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:28.680]   time, we can change some things to help us perceive it a little bit better, right? And a lot
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:36.600]   of this is very personal. It depends who you are. So, for like me, I was very cognizant of the fact
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:42.280]   that time felt like forever when I was a kid, but as I get older, time seems to fly by. So, for me,
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.240]   the path of the eldest brother actually made a lot of sense because I didn't mind grinding it out
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:52.280]   when I was a kid. I thought I had all the time in the world as I was in my 20s and 30s. I didn't
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.280]   mind doing the hard work of being a physician. That allowed me to accrue a lot of money so that
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.120]   eventually I could retire early. Now, time seems to fly by, but I have so much more control over
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.240]   my time than I ever did at any other time in life. So, the perception is that time is flying,
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.200]   but I feel so much more freedom and space because I don't have that many things I have to put in my
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.680]   time slots anymore. It's all up to me. Like, I don't have any official things. I don't have to
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:22.280]   do anything for work. Really, I get a lot more control over this. That was especially the thinking
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:27.400]   of the financial independence fire people of old was to do that, right? Because they perceived that
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:34.200]   sometime in the future would be more valuable than time today. Funny, younger people who are
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.680]   entering the fire movement today look at it the exact opposite. They perceive that time today is
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:44.360]   just as important and they don't want to put off purpose and identity and connections. So, for them,
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:48.360]   they're looking at the path of the middle or the youngest brother because they want to enjoy today.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.160]   They don't want to grind it out. They don't want to waste a second. So, they perceive today as
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:58.280]   more important or at least just as important as tomorrow. So, for them, they're not going to really
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.800]   do that path of the eldest brother. They're going to really look to be a middle or a youngest
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.840]   brother. So, we can play with what we put in those time slots and we can look at how we perceive time
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.680]   and what feels more important to us. And that's the only control we have of this most important
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.600]   thing in our life that pretty much is going to pass and happen no matter what we do.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:22.840]   And are there things you do that you haven't mentioned whether it's daily or annual or weekly
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:29.320]   routine that you think make your use of time more optimal now than it maybe was in the past?
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:37.080]   So, strangely enough, I feel like I have all the time in the world. So, I feel really now a place
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:43.560]   of time abundance. And I think there are a few reasons for that. One is I wake up really early.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.200]   I love waking up early. And the strange thing when you wake up at 4.35 in the morning,
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:53.000]   you just feel like your days last forever. So, for me, that's a great way to
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.640]   combat these worries about time. The other thing is because I've been real thoughtful over the
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.640]   years and have been financially successful as well as in other realms of my life, I've really
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.600]   been able to subtract out the things I hate. And so, I feel like partially I have an abundance
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.280]   of time because I've been able to get rid of the things I don't like. All those things about work
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:17.560]   I didn't like, being on call, working weekends, all those stressors in my life. So, I think that's
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.880]   a good thing for us to do whether we have lots of money or not is to say, "How can we substitute
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:27.400]   things we like in place of things we don't like and start getting rid of those things we don't
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.320]   like?" I've also do some other kind of daily habits that really help me. I like something
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:39.080]   called work bursting. So, as opposed to spending lots of time doing important things, I like to
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:45.480]   set a good two hours aside or an hour and do really hard stuff in a real concentrated burst
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.600]   of energy. And then I put it down and I do something leisurely for the next few hours.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.800]   So, it makes me feel like I have a lot of time in my days because that really hard,
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:01.240]   concentrated work I do in short bursts. And so, I really enjoy doing that. There are also some
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.840]   hacks. In the book, I talk a little bit about Parkinson's Law and the Pareto Principle. We can
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:11.080]   talk about that now if you want, but this idea that we can take advantage of these principles
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:18.440]   like Parkinson's Law says that basically the time you have to do a task will end up being the amount
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.600]   of time it takes to do that task, right? So, if you have a task and you have five hours to do it,
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.640]   it's going to take you five hours to do. On the other hand, if the same task, you only have two
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.000]   hours to do it, it's going to take you two hours to do. So, you can play around with this a little
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.760]   bit by for instance, halving the amount of time you give yourself to do things. So, if something
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:40.280]   normally takes you five hours, say "okay, I'm only going to do it in two hours". Most likely,
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.760]   you'll get 80 to 90% of the quality by spending a lot less time doing it. And there's some other
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.000]   tricks you can do. A big part of that, especially when you're doing these tasks, especially if
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.160]   they're burdensome, is being really clear about defining what done looks like. And so, making a
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.400]   goal of what done looks like and then deciding that when you hit that point, you'll stop and
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:05.080]   it's unrelated to time because often we go way past what's appropriate, especially if we feel
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.920]   like we have five hours allotted to something instead of two. So, I think there's some other
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:14.360]   tricks and hacks you can do, but the idea is to be thoughtful about how you use time most
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.880]   efficiently and then put those things in place to give you the sense of time abundance.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.840]   You mentioned that you used to be in a place where you were filled with time stress and
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.520]   running around trying to get more and more done and now you've gotten comfortable letting go and
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:36.280]   letting your wife, your kids set the pace for things. For people that are type A out there,
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.520]   and that sounds crazy, any advice?
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:45.320]   I think it's about being really thoughtful. I mean, a lot of us who are successful are used
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.760]   to being super efficient. It's how we got to our success because we could do three things at once
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:56.200]   or we could get more done in a day than other people. And I love that, right? I think that's
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:02.440]   really served me at times in my career, but the other side is you become so super efficient that
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.480]   it becomes anxiety provoking. And then instead of feeling time abundance, you start feeling
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:13.480]   time scarcity. And it's the oddest thing that the more efficient we get, the more we start cramping
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.560]   more and more into smaller spaces and start convincing yourself we don't have enough time
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:24.280]   so we start rushing through things. So, for me, I've had to really let go of the reins and really
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.240]   put things in place so that I don't have as much control over time. So, one of those ways is again,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.920]   like as opposed to rushing around to go somewhere, I now let someone else decide our time frame
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:43.160]   and make myself stick to what they want. And so unload that worry about time because I've
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.920]   gotten so good and efficient at time that I'm rushing everywhere and I knew that had to stop.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.720]   So, it's two signs of a coin, right? In one way, it's really great because it allows us to do a
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:57.080]   lot of things. But if you get too crazy about time, then you're no longer enjoying yourself
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.000]   and you're rushing to get through what you're doing now to get to the next thing, which kills
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.840]   all sorts of enjoyment or being present in what you're doing. And that's no good either.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.320]   We didn't talk much about the fact that you have children. I now have children.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.840]   You've spent a lot of time thinking about money at a level and purpose and identity
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:19.480]   at a level that I haven't yet. And I certainly haven't for my kids. Two months, two years old,
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.800]   maybe it's too early. But given what you've thought and for any parents listening,
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.640]   what advice do you have for taking some of these lessons, whether they're purpose-driven,
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.640]   whether they're financial-driven and teaching them to children as parents?
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:39.320]   Get it together yourself and then model that behavior and your kids will follow suit.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.240]   I think we often talk about what exercises we should do with our children,
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:49.000]   what we specifically should teach them didactically, what we should get them involved
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.920]   in. I'm thoroughly convinced that the way your kids actually learn is watching how you navigate
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:00.920]   the world. So, it sounds a little funny, but I think that we as adults should concentrate on
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:08.280]   ourselves, develop these great meaningful habits and live them out in front of our children so
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.120]   they can see. And I think that more than anything else will give them a good handle on what living
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.880]   a purposeful life, a full life looks like. I'll add a caveat to what you said, which is
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:27.480]   for some of these lessons, just doing them only works if you also expose your children to it.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.280]   So, from a financial standpoint, I might be organized and thoughtful about my personal
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:37.160]   finances and maybe at two years old and two months old, it's not the time. But at some point,
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.600]   I can't just live that, I also have to bring the family into it. Making sure that you're
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.840]   not just doing it, but you're also sharing that you're doing it. For some of these things matters.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.040]   Maybe for doing a job you're fulfilled, people will kind of get that through osmosis with you
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:57.320]   in the house. But I do think that when it comes to finances, some of the things that I want to do in
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.800]   the future, at least just not make them taboo topics that we don't talk about as a family.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.880]   Yeah. And I think also part of that modeling good behavior to go the next step forward and be a
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.960]   little more explicit is also giving them the space to then try those techniques and fail safely. So,
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.840]   in our household, one way we did that is our kids could watch how we dealt with things financially,
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.320]   but then we started giving them a yearly allowance, which we gave to them the first of the year.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.200]   We clearly stated what they were responsible for and what we were responsible for. And then
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.960]   they had to decide what to do with that allowance the whole year. They weren't getting any more from
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:37.480]   us. And so, that was a way we'd been modeling for years good behavior, but then we could actually
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:43.640]   set up a controlled experiment where the truth of the matter was there was no real risk for them,
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.520]   but they could then experiment, try some of those things, those techniques that we had been modeling,
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.080]   see what worked for them, see that hadn't, make some mistakes, have a little egg on their face
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.320]   when they did something wrong and then learn. So, I think that's part of that modeling is then to
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:04.120]   give them some space. - And how did the allowance for the year up front experiment go? - In some
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.280]   ways, it did some unexpected things, but then at least we could address it. So, for instance,
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:13.720]   my daughter, we found became ultra scared of spending and always had way more left at the
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:18.760]   end of the year than she probably should have. My son, on the other hand, was confident everything
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.160]   would work and often spent too much in the beginning and then a catastrophe would hit and
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.640]   he'd find that he didn't have enough money. A perfect example is he spent most of his money,
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.000]   he had just a little bit left and he had about three or four months left, and then he dropped
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.400]   his phone into a lake when we were paddle boarding. And so, all of a sudden, he's like,
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.120]   "I have zero money. I can't buy a used phone. I can't do anything, but I didn't foresee this
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.280]   coming because I thought I was doing a good job, but I didn't see that something unexpected might
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.440]   happen." It plays out differently with different kids, but the idea then is then to have those
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.000]   gentle conversations. With my daughter, it might be, "Hmm, you know, it's great. You had a lot of
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.840]   money left over. Your bank account's really growing, but are you enjoying that money?"
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.920]   Right? And then for my son, it might be like, "Yeah, money's a powerful tool, but if you're
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.840]   not careful and a good steward of it, you may find you don't have it when you need it." And so,
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.280]   those are different conversations you can have, but it all starts with the modeling,
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.320]   then kind of those simple experiments, and then the talking to him.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:19.160]   So, did you loan your son money against his future year of allowance? How do you handle that one?
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.720]   The darn problem with my son is he's so goddarn innovative. Here's a perfect example. Like,
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.960]   my son is known as the electronics guy on the neighborhood. So, people give him old
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.960]   or broken electronics. The other day, someone gave him an old or broken phone,
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.880]   and he realized it was still under warranty, sent it back to an Apple, and they sent him a new phone.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.920]   [Laughter]
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.360]   Okay. So, he figured it out himself.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.000]   So, he's a pretty savvy guy. He figures out either how to fix most things
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.040]   or to find his way into something new. The problem with this phone is it ended
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.040]   up at the bottom of the lake. He couldn't get it back.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.600]   This has been fantastic. There's a lot more in the book, and I want to hear more about where
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.960]   to find everything you're working on. But before that, one thing I like to do is ask people to pick
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:04.600]   a place that they know well, anywhere in the world, and share with listeners who may go there someday,
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:09.320]   a place to eat, a place to grab a drink, and maybe an unusual activity that they should check out
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.800]   to kind of fulfill their inspiration for travel. Is there a place you have in mind?
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:22.040]   I'm not a big travel guy, okay? But here has been my joy with my family and I've spent so much time
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.600]   remembering and thinking about these vacations. So, it's added a huge amount of joy in my life.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.600]   Once a year, especially before COVID, my whole family would take a week and go to Mexico. A lot
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.040]   of times we go to like Playa del Carmen or someone in the Cancun sign, and we go to an
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:42.600]   all-inclusive hotel, and we would literally sit by the pool for a week altogether. The all-inclusives
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.360]   have good restaurants, and the wonderful thing about it is it costs a lot up front, but once
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:51.000]   you pay for it, everything's paid for, right? So, you get pretty much all the food, all the drinks,
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.400]   all the sun, all the pool, all the spa that you want. So, it's expensive up front,
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:02.280]   but I've had so many joyful weeks. It's still the one thing I look forward to every single year.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.880]   It's the thing I dream about in the middle of the winter in Chicago when it's cold and we're
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.680]   all like snuggled up in our beds. And the time I got with my family, with the kids,
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.320]   to think about the progression every year and how they changed and how we were together
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:20.440]   is priceless. So, I guess the moral of the story is if you get the chance,
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:26.200]   take some time to go somewhere where you don't have a lot of things planned, but that's just
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:31.560]   a fun place to be, where you can be with your family with no responsibilities and no worries
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.800]   about money and just be for a week. And it's really, really valuable.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.320]   - I don't know if this has always been the case, but there are some
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:45.000]   really nice all-inclusive resorts. I think my assumption is always that they're all like these
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.600]   cheap crappy resorts. That is not the case. - Oh no, there are some nice ones if you're
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.440]   willing to pay for it. But again, if people are listening to your show, they probably understand
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.600]   how to travel hack, they probably get free flights, they'll probably get some bonuses
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.680]   and some free things from the hotel they go to. So, for them, it may not actually end up being
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.800]   that expensive, but it's a wonderful luxury. And I suggest anyone, especially with a family,
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.000]   do it if you can. - Wonderful. You could go find the book
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.320]   anywhere books are sold, but where can people stay on top of everything you're doing and working on?
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:19.560]   - So, the easiest way is to go to jordangrumet.com. That's J-O-R-D-A-N-G-R-U-M-E-T.com.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:24.360]   There you can see links to the book. You can also see links to the three ways in which I create
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:31.880]   content. So, from 2005 to 2018 or so, I wrote a medical blog, over a thousand posts there about
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.880]   being a doctor, about life in general. That's linked there. The diversify blog was the blog
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.040]   I started about personal finance, that's linked there. And then the earn and invest podcast is
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.440]   what I spend my most time doing right now, which is the most current, and that's also linked there.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.760]   Or you can just go to earnandinvest.com. But jordangrumet.com or earnandinvest.com are the
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.720]   easiest ways. You can see links to all my socials there and everything.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.880]   - Yeah. And you're on a podcast now, so you can also just search for the earn and invest podcast.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.520]   While you're listening, there's a great episode with me, of course.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.000]   - Well, of course. That was a great episode.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.160]   - Well, Jordan, thank you so much for being here.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.000]   - Thanks for having me. This was a blast.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.440]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you so much for listening.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.400]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:21.480]   I would really appreciate it. And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me,
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.160]   or just want to say hi, I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.680]   That's it for this week. I'll see you next week.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:40.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.820]   you
