[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.120]   On Monday, we took a question from Rose,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.000]   a woman who has emailed us several times over the years.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.680]   She's emailed us the same brief question,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.420]   how do I pray for my husband to be saved?
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.240]   It's a question from desperation
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.200]   and maybe from weariness too.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.320]   So how does a woman, how does a wife like Rose
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.960]   not lose heart in praying for her husband over years?
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.760]   And maybe even over decades?
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.840]   Pastor John there ended his answer
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800]   with a brief mention of Luke 18 verses one to eight,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000]   a parable, a great parable for those
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.500]   who need motivation to endure in prayer.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.560]   But it's also a very odd parable.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.160]   It has sometimes been called the parable
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.560]   of the unjust judge,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.280]   which is where one of the problems rests.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   How and why is God likened to a godless, unjust judge?
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.880]   Because of this, we often just skirt that problem
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.560]   and we just call it preferably
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.080]   the parable of the persistent widow.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.280]   That's cleaner.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.640]   But no matter what we call it,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.360]   this remains perhaps the oddest parable
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.960]   that Jesus ever told.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.880]   Odd because of how many false correlations
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080]   we need to untangle to understand it.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.660]   And that's what we do today in a clip
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.680]   from a sermon preached on January 9th
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.320]   at the end of the first week of 1983.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.000]   So way back the first week of 1983.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.520]   Here's a very young Pastor John
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.960]   preaching during a pretty intense season
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.960]   of focused prayer for himself and for his church.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.920]   Here's what he said.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.760]   - It's one of the few parables to be interpreted
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.220]   right at the outset, lest we miss the point.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.300]   Verse one of chapter 18 of Luke
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.840]   is the interpretation to the parable.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.520]   He said, "Tell them a parable to the effect
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   "that they ought always to pray and not lose heart."
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.000]   Jesus' answer to the question,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.120]   "How can you endure to the end and be saved?"
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.960]   is pray, pray, pray,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.600]   and don't lose heart in your praying.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.200]   The parable goes like this.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.080]   In a certain city, there was a judge
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.020]   who neither feared God nor regarded man,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.180]   and there was a widow in that city
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.720]   who kept coming to him and saying,
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.180]   "Vindicate me against my adversary."
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.940]   For a while, he refused, and afterward he said,
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.200]   "Although I neither fear God nor regard man,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080]   "yet because this widow bothers me,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.600]   "I'll vindicate her, or she'll wear me out
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.920]   "by this continual coming."
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.400]   Now, don't be offended that Jesus
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   compares God, the Father, to an unjust judge.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.680]   That happens several times in the Bible.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.780]   For example, the most familiar one,
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.880]   Jesus' coming is called the coming of what in the night?
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.560]   A thief, which is not very complimentary to Jesus.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.040]   But clearly, when the New Testament talks like that,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.880]   it doesn't mean Jesus is a thief.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.400]   It means that the point of comparison
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.760]   is suddenness, unexpectedness.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   So here, the point of comparison is not that God is unjust,
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.480]   but that he gives in to prevailing prayer.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560]   Verse seven draws out the lesson very clearly,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.480]   which was stated in verse one,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.880]   "And will not God vindicate his elect
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.560]   "who cry to him day and night?"
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.500]   The answer, of course, is obviously God will vindicate
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.800]   his elect who cry to him day and night,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.480]   that is, who always pray.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.280]   Therefore, the point of the parable is,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.080]   cry to God day and night.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   Show yourself to be the elect
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.000]   by acting like the way the elect always act,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.320]   cry to God day and night,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.440]   or to use the words of verse one,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.720]   pray always.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.880]   Don't lose heart.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.120]   And if you do that, you will not become like Lot's wife,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.880]   in love with the world and turned back
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.780]   into a pillar of salt.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.960]   You will not be left in judgment
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.120]   as one is snatched away from your home.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.540]   You will endure in faith and love,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.080]   and God will vindicate you when the Son of Man
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.560]   flashes from one horizon to the other.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.840]   So always pray, and don't lose heart.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.280]   Now, what's driving me this morning in this sermon
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.920]   is that this is the last day of a week of concerted prayer.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.240]   So we're at the end, right?
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.160]   The end of prayer week.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.320]   That's a dangerous place to be,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.080]   according to this parable.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.560]   Don't end, is what this parable is saying.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.000]   If we end praying, we're in trouble, deep trouble.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.240]   Some of us this week have had a great time.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.260]   I've prayed more hours in the first week of 83
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.640]   than any week in my life, and many of you have too.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.480]   Now what?
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   The word of Jesus to us this morning is don't stop praying.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.600]   Don't peter out.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.840]   Don't be fickle.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.160]   Always, always, always pray.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.080]   Cry to God day and night.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.680]   Here's the way Peter put it in his first letter.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.480]   The end of all things as at hand.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   Therefore, be sane and sober for your prayers.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.200]   The closer the end draws near,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.160]   the more threat against the warmth of the faith
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.240]   of the church, and the greater the need
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.560]   for persevering prayer.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.960]   The pressures of worldliness will be so great
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.240]   as the end draws near that only a few,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.840]   Jesus said, most men's love will grow cold.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.360]   Only a few will make it.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.620]   I hope we're among the number.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.440]   Now how does this parable, how does this parable
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.500]   help us and encourage us to pray continually?
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.120]   The widow comes to an unjust judge
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.400]   and she pleads for help.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.680]   Evidently, she's being oppressed by some rascal
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.860]   and she's helpless, and she asks the judge,
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.620]   vindicate me, help me, tell him to stop that.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.600]   And that's us, right?
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.420]   The widow, weak, poor, no husband to stand up for her.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.260]   Her only recourse, the judge, even though he's unjust,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.260]   and our only recourse, God.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.700]   Now the argument of the parable is not,
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.660]   well, if you can get on the case of the judge long enough,
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.340]   he'll try to get you off his back by vindicating you.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.500]   Therefore, if you get on God's case long enough,
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.340]   then to get you off his back, he will vindicate you.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.660]   You could interpret the parable that way,
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.020]   but there are two reasons why you shouldn't.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.740]   The first is that that would contradict clearly Luke 12,
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.980]   32, where it says, "It is your father's good pleasure
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.700]   to give you the kingdom."
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.780]   He's not reneging on any promises.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.620]   He's just eager to give you the kingdom.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.780]   But the main reason why we shouldn't construe the parable
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.660]   that way is that there are two clues right here
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.740]   in the parable for the fact that God isn't like that judge.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.580]   Notice in verse 2, "This judge neither feared God
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.860]   nor regarded man."
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.180]   And those two things are repeated in verse 4,
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.300]   "Though I neither fear God nor regard man,
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.860]   yet I will vindicate her."
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.220]   Now, when it says, "Yet I will vindicate her,"
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.260]   that must mean that fearing God or not fearing God
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:09.260]   and not regarding men are big obstacles to helping the widow.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.700]   Right?
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.620]   If you don't fear God, it's an obstacle
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.180]   to get over to help her.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.580]   He gets over it by ulterior motives.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.660]   But notice first, he doesn't fear God.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.620]   And if fearing God is an obstacle to helping the widow,
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.540]   then presumably, if you did fear God,
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.740]   you would incline naturally to help the widow.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.820]   Right?
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.260]   That must mean that God isn't at all like this judge.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.340]   Because if he inclines the people who fear him
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.140]   to give to the widow liberally and quickly,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.580]   he must be that kind of God.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.020]   And so by saying that this judge doesn't fear God
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.100]   and therefore doesn't answer her readily,
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.940]   he shows that God isn't at all like the unjust judge.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.540]   And so the argument of the parable
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.500]   is an argument from lesser to greater.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.340]   If by knocking on the door of the judge who
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.580]   doesn't have an ounce of justice in his body,
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.580]   you can still get your answer, how much more by knocking
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.460]   on God's door continually will you most certainly be answered?
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.260]   Because he's not like a judge at all.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.300]   The second thing it says about the judge
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.540]   is that he has no regard for man.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:37.740]   Now, we need to ask, since he doesn't know this widow
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.900]   and therefore doesn't care about her at all, has no regard to her,
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.660]   is God like that?
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.100]   When we approach him and pray to him,
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.940]   verse 7 makes it very, very clear that that's not the case.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.260]   Because verse 7 says, Jesus says,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:10:00.300]   "And will not God vindicate his elect?"
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   When they cry to him night and day, see that word "elect"?
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.820]   That's a dynamite word.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.740]   That means when we come to God and pray to him,
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.060]   we're not coming like a stranger, a widow whom
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.700]   he doesn't know or care about.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:24.780]   He has chosen us, elected us, set his favor upon us,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.020]   adopted us into his family, made us his children.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.620]   When we knock on the door and say, it's me,
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.900]   he's very different than when a strange widow knocks
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.940]   on an unjust judge's door and says, it's me.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.380]   Who?
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.180]   God knows our voice.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.380]   We're his children.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.460]   We're the chosen.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.140]   We're the elect.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.020]   And therefore, Jesus argues, same from lesser to greater,
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.740]   if an unjust judge who has a stranger whom he doesn't care
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.420]   about at all knocking on his door will give in to her,
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:07.060]   how much more will God, who not only knows us but chose us,
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:13.700]   loves us, adopts us readily and lovingly answer our request?
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.500]   So the parable is intended to encourage
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.380]   us to get on with the business of praying
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.580]   because we have such a hopeful prospect of being answered.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.740]   When Jesus asks at the end of the parable now in verse 8,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.260]   "When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.340]   Coming at the end of this parable,
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.420]   that could be also phrased like this.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.300]   When the Son of Man comes, will he
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:49.060]   find that we have kept praying or not?
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.140]   Evidently, in Jesus' mind, prayer and faith
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.780]   stand and fall together.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.140]   Yeah, that's a fascinating connection with verse 8
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.860]   in the parable.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.860]   Persistent prayer and enduring faith
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.460]   are correlated as the same thing.
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.580]   Persistent prayer and enduring faith
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.340]   are correlated as basically the same thing.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.460]   Such an important parable to understand.
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.980]   That was from John Piper's sermon
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:24.260]   preached on January 9, 1983, titled "Always Pray and Do Not
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.980]   Lose Heart."
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.860]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.980]   Today, I am your host, Tony Reike,
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.540]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.540]   when we return on Friday to close out this week.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.420]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:44.480]   [ Silence ]
