[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   If you graph the number of deaths from war, man-made deaths, starting in the 18th century,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.000]   it's almost exponential up to 1943, when 15 million people died between the war itself
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.920]   and the Holocaust. And then it starts to decline as the war begins to come to an end. In 1945,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.760]   it drops down to about one to two million deaths, and it stays there ever after. We lose six to
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.320]   seven million people in the world every year from smoking. So in a curious way, the introduction of
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.960]   how to control nuclear energy changed the nature of nation-states, such that they could no longer,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   at the limit, defend their borders with war. All the countries that worked on the bomb at
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.400]   some level were thinking, "Oh my God, we're going to have a weapon that will surpass them all."
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.960]   They thought it would grandize national power, but what it did was put a limit to national power.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.160]   For the first time in the history of the world, war became something that was historical,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520]   rather than universal. And who did that? Scientists.
