[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.640]   Is your cash stash big enough?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.960]   I want you to pile that stuff up to the ceiling.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.560]   When you travel in foreign parts,

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.840]   My guess does.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.920]   Are you walking around uninsured or underinsured
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.560]   for a $4 million, $6 million, or $10 million asset you own?
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.040]   Unless you thoroughly understand
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   your disability income insurance,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560]   it's likely that you are.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.280]   What about physical preparation?
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.560]   How did you fare through

[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.800]   It's a lighthearted question,
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.480]   and I ask it to highlight the importance
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.200]   of financial and physical preparedness.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.280]   If you weren't financially prepared for 2020
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.640]   in your lifestyle and career,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.460]   this has been a tough year.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.200]   And if you weren't physically prepared,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.560]   it's been a headache.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.960]   Today's show focuses on what you can do
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.480]   to meet any exigency the world sends your way.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.040]   It's how to wade through the manure
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.440]   and come up smelling like a rose.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.200]   Hey, and welcome to the Life Meets Money podcast.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.760]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.600]   I'm Matt Miner, your money guide,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.120]   and Life Meets Money exists
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.360]   to help you plan to fund the life you love.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.740]   It's the show for MBAs, entrepreneurs,
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.760]   and other professionals who want their financial plan
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.120]   to work as hard as they do.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.720]   Today's Money Guide Quick Tip is in two parts.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.360]   First, on disability insurance,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.280]   and then on applying the lessons of COVID-19 pandemic
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.480]   to your financial plan.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.960]   Disability insurance is a cornerstone of financial planning.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.920]   In your life, make sure the disability insurance you carry,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.120]   whether through your employer or privately,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.540]   addresses your family's actual needs and goals.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.160]   I'll go on the record right now, along with my guest,
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.760]   and say that I would do without any other type of insurance
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.660]   in order to have the disability income insurance
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.120]   my family needs.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.880]   I prefer to give a TED Talk in Spiderman underpants
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.480]   rather than be uninsured for disability.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.560]   I don't sell the stuff,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.360]   but if you or your family counts on your income to live,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.820]   DI is incredibly important.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.120]   Now, as you've lived through COVID-19 in 2020,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.620]   what have you learned about your life or your money?
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.260]   Where, for example, can you cut back your spending
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.520]   to increase your cash on hand?
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.360]   Alternately, what areas of your life
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.480]   cry out for increased spending?
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.700]   Do you need to make your home office
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.280]   more comfortable or professional?
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.360]   Would you enjoy converting your back deck to a screen porch
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.000]   so you can take some of your calls in the fresh air?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.120]   While COVID is still fresh in your mind,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.240]   take stock of what you've learned
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   and prepare some changes for the future.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.120]   Today's show features an influential voice in my life
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.720]   as I made the switch from corporate work
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.440]   to financial planning.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.720]   And as you radicals know,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.280]   my guest's opinions generate strong feelings,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.200]   and he's not bashful sharing ideas
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.240]   that push the boundaries of our thinking.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.600]   I know you'll enjoy listening in on our conversation
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.000]   addressing the broad topic of risk management,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.540]   including emergency funds, insurance planning,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.400]   and physical preparedness.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.760]   Today's episode was recorded on September 24th, 2020,
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.720]   and released on the Life Meets Money podcast in two parts,
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.600]   October 8th and 15th, 2020.

[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.040]   Joshua, I am absolutely delighted to be here with you today.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.800]   I feel like this is a huge milestone on the show
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.640]   to have you on.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.180]   Thank you so much for spending some time
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.680]   with the Life Meets Money listeners.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.080]   - Thank you for having me.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.260]   - So I always start by asking my guests
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.940]   to give us a little bit of background on their history,
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.320]   both personally and professionally,
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.120]   whatever you'd like to share on this show
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.740]   to introduce yourself to people who haven't met you before.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.840]   - Yeah, I have an interesting background in the sense
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.300]   that especially for a financial show,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.080]   that I feel like I have a decent understanding
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.800]   of most parts of finance.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.480]   And really, that really crosses the gamut.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   When I was younger,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.800]   I was very interested in personal finance.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.480]   I remember being a teenager
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.640]   and getting all the classic mainstream personal finance books
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.280]   from the library and from the bookstore.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.580]   I would read "The Automatic Millionaire."
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.640]   And I remember when I was in high school,
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.120]   I would go to tickets.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.040]   I went to T. Harv Ecker's Millionaire Mind weekend event,
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   and I was really interested in becoming wealthy.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.280]   And so I studied most personal finance stuff
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   from the perspective of a consumer.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.560]   After college, I went and joined a marketing
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.160]   and brand management consulting company,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.760]   and I got laid off from that job in 2008,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.480]   and I didn't know what I wanted to do.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.760]   I knew I wanted to run my own business in some capacity.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.320]   And my former boss suggested
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.960]   that I consider becoming a financial advisor,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.680]   'cause he knew about my interest in personal finance.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.880]   I was the nerd who I would hand out
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.480]   personal finance books at work.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   And I'm not making that up.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.240]   I remember I gave him a copy of "My Total Money Makeover"
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.040]   by Dave Ramsey, had been very influential for me.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.160]   It's like, "Here, you should read this."
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.040]   And so he read it, and we talked about it
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.320]   when he was done with it.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   And so he said, "You should go be a financial advisor."
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   And so I went and started interviewing
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.760]   around the financial advice industry,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.240]   and I realized that I could probably build
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.800]   a lot of my personal lifestyle ambitions
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.120]   by becoming a professional financial advisor.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.360]   So in 2008, I started that process.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   I started with a life insurance company,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.720]   primarily selling life insurance, disability insurance,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   long-term care insurance,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.520]   little bit of health insurance on the side.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.120]   And then I went on and started working my way
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.840]   through the process of becoming licensed
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.000]   with the securities, on the security side of the business,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.680]   became a financial advisor,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.920]   started managing portfolios, et cetera.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.240]   And along the way, I invested heavily
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.480]   in my professional education.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.120]   I became a certified financial planner,
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.200]   a chartered life underwriter,
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.840]   a chartered financial consultant.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.640]   I studied group benefits, I studied health insurance,
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.720]   I studied charitable planning.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.680]   I wound up getting a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.840]   And in that context, I learned a lot
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.720]   that in some ways enhanced what I had learned
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.200]   as a personal finance aficionado,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.400]   but in some cases, contradicted it.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.360]   And along the way, I continued to consume
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.440]   mainstream personal finance stuff.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.520]   I listened to Clark Howard, I listened to Dave Ramsey,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   I enjoyed that kind of content,
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.880]   but I would find myself shaking my fist at the radio saying,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.280]   "Come on, Dave," or "Come on, Clark,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.840]   "you don't understand this,"
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.520]   or "You're not articulating that."
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.960]   And so in 2014, I decided to start a podcast
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.200]   and I launched a show called Radical Personal Finance.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.680]   My goal was to take some of my background and knowledge
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.520]   and bridge the gap between personal financial advice
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.880]   and professional financial advice.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.200]   Because in my experience, that gap was very, very large.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.280]   That professional financial advisors
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   with a deep background in the technical forms of analysis,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.520]   number one, they can't really talk to the public,
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.200]   legally speaking, about a lot of the intricate stuff.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.720]   Number two, when they do talk to the public,
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.880]   everybody just zones out
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.440]   because it's horribly uninteresting.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.540]   But yet in the personal finance world,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.780]   that's where the listeners are,
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.440]   that's where the education is,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.080]   but a lot of times, the people speaking
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.240]   don't have the deep technical background.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.840]   And a professional advisor wants to beat their head
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.680]   against the wall sometimes in listening to it.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.120]   And I thought, "Somebody with my background
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.860]   "should cross the divide."
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.760]   So I had to leave the financial planning advice industry
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.120]   in order to be able to do it effectively
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.460]   the way that I wanted to.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.640]   So I closed my firm
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.680]   and I launched Radical Personal Finance in 2014.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.800]   And so now, about six years later,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.500]   I have a podcast, it's a primary outlet,
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.100]   a podcast of about 750 episodes
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.720]   where I teach financial planning in public.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.200]   And the tagline of the show
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.040]   is how to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.440]   in 10 years or less.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.460]   What I try to do is I try to show
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.520]   how having a clear understanding
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.440]   of what you're working towards in personal finance
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.080]   is the foundation.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.880]   And then having a good understanding
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.800]   of the technical tools involved
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.020]   and how that understanding and that education
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.760]   will help you achieve those goals faster.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.840]   So that's my personal story.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.480]   - This is a fun and poignant interview for me
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.880]   because one of your key tenets,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.440]   or at least one of the ones that I love most from your show,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.840]   and I've been following along since about 2015,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.040]   is the idea of doing work that you would do
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.680]   if you would never retire.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.640]   And that was a key kind of philosophical motivator
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.500]   to the big career switch that I made
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.600]   about two and a half years ago,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.460]   following you into the financial advice profession
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.880]   where I plan to stay.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.420]   But I found a way to do this media stuff on the side
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.640]   and in a compliant way and in a way that's helpful.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.440]   And I'm enjoying doing both right now.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.560]   So thank you for all the service that you've rendered to me
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.080]   and my career and to my family along the way.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.920]   - My pleasure.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.320]   I think that's one of the ideas
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.160]   that I have sought to popularize
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.820]   because if you're working at work that you care about
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.960]   for reasons that are important to you
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.460]   and you don't want to retire,
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.320]   then in many cases, all of your financial planning
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.640]   becomes simpler and easier.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.600]   And it's dramatically easier to find and develop a job
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.040]   or a business that you love
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.760]   that provides you with a really excellent lifestyle
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.960]   than it is for many people to accumulate
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.280]   the millions of dollars that most of us need
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.720]   to never work again.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   And so I'm all about doing an 80/20 analysis on life
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.940]   and going with the few things
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.360]   that are gonna make the biggest difference.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.880]   And I'm convinced that that's a cornerstone idea.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.960]   And I applaud you for being willing to engage in the training
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.520]   and the hard work necessary to make that career switch.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.200]   - One of your go-to pieces
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.420]   and another one of the things that I enjoy from your show
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.520]   is your framework for the stages of financial independence.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.720]   And I'll save you mentioning
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.560]   that you cribbed this from Tony Robbins.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.280]   And anyway, I like the way you say it
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.320]   better than the way he says it.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.760]   And your advice is better than his too.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.400]   So even if he owns more islands,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.920]   I'm interested in your ideas.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.120]   I wonder if you'd walk us through those stages.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.280]   - Yeah, this came from reading the money book
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.440]   that Tony Robbins wrote
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.220]   after many years of not writing books.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.280]   He published a book called "Money, Master the Game."
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.880]   In that book, he was talking about
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.680]   the stages of financial independence.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.080]   And I was inspired by what he said,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.320]   but I disagreed with some of it.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.800]   And so I wrote my own.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.360]   And the basic idea behind developing stages
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   is to break down large goals into more meaningful steps.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.520]   Because most of us understand
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.120]   that the way that you accomplish a big challenging goal
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.000]   is by understanding the basic steps
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.840]   and the levels to that goal.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.660]   And in my experience
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.520]   working as a professional financial advisor,
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.400]   I learned that if I just told someone,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.120]   "Oh, look, you need $4 million,"
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.440]   and they had $30,000,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.600]   they would often walk out of my office demotivated
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.700]   and lacking clarity on anything that they needed to do
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.060]   because the goal wasn't tangible.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.240]   It was far off.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.920]   It wasn't meaningful to their life.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.060]   And it was just a number,
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.160]   which is hard for the human brain to grasp.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   And so I developed these stages
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.560]   to try to give somebody an idea
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.080]   that when you're working
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   towards personal financial independence,
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.280]   it comes at different levels.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   It's not like you're either dependent or independent.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.280]   Rather, we're dealing with ranges
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.040]   or percentages of independence.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.640]   And so I began it with stage zero,
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   which is financial dependence.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.380]   We all begin our financial lives
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.920]   from a place of financial dependence.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.920]   My children are totally dependent on me for their living,
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.580]   for their food, for everything.
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.480]   They're totally dependent on me.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.120]   And this can apply to adults as well.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.820]   We might be a dependent adult.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.160]   Perhaps we've suffered some kind of setback,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.280]   lost a job, went through a health scare of some kind,
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.480]   and we find ourselves depending
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.760]   on other people to provide for us.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.920]   That's where we begin.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.360]   So the first goal is to move from stage zero,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.800]   which is financial dependence,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.040]   to stage one, which is financial solvency.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.800]   And I define financial solvency
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.520]   as simply the ability to pay for your living expenses
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.840]   and being current on your debts.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.240]   One place of dependence that many people find themselves
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.920]   is they find themselves behind on debts,
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   unable to make their required payments.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.340]   And so the first goal is to get current,
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.500]   get current on your debts,
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.040]   and to be able to cover your own living expenses.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.880]   And that's solvency, stage one, financial solvency.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.800]   Then from financial solvency,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.240]   we wanna move on to financial stability, which is stage two.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.360]   Financial stability simply means
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   that you have some margin in your finances.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.680]   And this means you have some savings.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.000]   This can be as simple as developing
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.100]   a beginning emergency fund.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.440]   For a young person, perhaps you have an 18-year-old son
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.480]   who is leaving the house.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.980]   Well, if he doesn't have any debts
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.480]   and he's able to get a job to pay his living expenses,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.560]   he's solvent, he's no longer dependent on you.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.760]   And if that same son saves $1,000,
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.440]   he's now starting to accumulate
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.680]   some measure of financial stability.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.520]   If he needs a new tire on his car,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.400]   it's not gonna sink him.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.000]   He's not gonna fall into debt for that.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.800]   And so that's financial stability.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.080]   For most of us who are adults,
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.800]   financial stability brings in some larger numbers.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.960]   But the basic idea is you wanna figure out
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.360]   how much of an emergency fund do I want to have?
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.480]   How much savings do I want to have?
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.240]   And start to accumulate that.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.000]   I think there are a number of numbers that are useful.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.920]   Might be $1,000, might be $10,000,
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.560]   might be three months of expenses
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.720]   or six months of expenses.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.160]   For some people, maybe a year's worth of expenses.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.880]   But you want to develop some form of savings
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.120]   so that you are financially stable.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.520]   That's stage two.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.160]   Now, the next thing that I talk about,
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.600]   and I put it at stage three,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.560]   although it may not go at stage three,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.000]   is debt freedom.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.080]   The goal that many of us have of living a life
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.120]   free from the encumbrances of debt
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   is a very worthy goal.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.200]   Because if somebody is debt free,
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.240]   that means they have full control over their future.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.160]   I'm not arguing that debt may not be a very useful tool
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.760]   at some points in life.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.440]   But any form of debt commits you
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.640]   to certain actions in the future.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.600]   And so if you want freedom and independence in your life,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.120]   being debt free should be on your list of priorities.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.440]   And so I put it here as stage three,
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.280]   that the goal is to be debt free.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.400]   If somebody has enough money to pay their living expenses,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.520]   if they're current on all their bills,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.160]   if they have an emergency fund of,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.000]   let's just say $10,000,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.360]   and if they don't have any debt,
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.240]   or at least don't have any consumer debt,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.160]   they may have a mortgage on their house,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.240]   but they don't have car debt, credit card debt, et cetera,
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.520]   that person is very, very independent.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.480]   That person has the ability to change
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.560]   almost anything in their life.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.160]   They can leave one career,
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.680]   retrain and start another career.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.000]   They can move across the country.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.200]   They can move from a house that doesn't suit them
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.280]   into a better house that does suit them.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.200]   If their elderly mother gets sick
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.480]   and they want to go and nurse their elderly mother,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.640]   they can submit their notice at their work
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.200]   and go and nurse their elderly mother.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.880]   They have independence.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.080]   And so independence can be won fairly simply
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.280]   through those basic steps.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.200]   Now there are four remaining stages,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.560]   and the next three, stage four, five, and six,
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.040]   are basically variations on a theme.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.760]   Most of my listeners and clients
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.200]   have a goal of being able to work because they want to,
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.880]   not because they have to.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.440]   Most of my listeners and clients
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.680]   have a goal of being able to live on the income
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.760]   from their investment portfolio.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.680]   But there are wide ranges of income that they could live on.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.400]   If you tell me, Joshua,
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.040]   how much money do you want to retire?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.080]   I'm probably gonna give you a big number
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.240]   that involves extravagant international travel,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.960]   lots of consumption items,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.440]   lots of expensive experiences, et cetera.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.320]   But if you said, Joshua,
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.280]   what's the bare minimum that you would need to retire?
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.840]   Well, there's a big difference in those numbers.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.640]   I might want to live in a beautiful home on the lake,
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.260]   but I could live in a small trailer
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.720]   in a modest trailer park in Central Florida.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.800]   I might want to take international vacations every year,
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.120]   but I could take a domestic hiking vacation if I wanted to.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.080]   So what I did was I broke this
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.320]   into stage four, financial security,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.240]   stage five, financial independence,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.280]   and stage six, financial freedom.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.760]   And I defined these in this way.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.640]   Stage four, financial security means
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.600]   you have enough money coming in
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.520]   from your investment portfolio
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.480]   for you to cover your basic living expenses,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.600]   for you to cover the rent on your apartment,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.320]   the mortgage on your house,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.800]   a food in the pantry, basic utilities, et cetera.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   If you have enough income coming in
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.840]   from your investment portfolio
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.600]   that covers your basic living expenses,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.800]   then you have a degree of financial security.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.640]   If you were disabled
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.520]   and you could never work again the rest of your life,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.440]   you would be okay.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.000]   That's what I call stage four, financial security.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.200]   Stage five is financial independence.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.600]   Financial independence means
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.160]   you can cover your current living expenses
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.560]   based upon the income from your portfolio.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.940]   Maybe you could live on $3,000 a month if you had to,
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.060]   but you're currently spending $7,000 a month
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.880]   because you do a lot of things that you enjoy doing.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.800]   And so financial independence means
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.640]   covering your current living expenses.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.200]   And I use that word independence
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.640]   because that's what most of us think of.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.400]   I can live at my current lifestyle
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.560]   on the income from my portfolio.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.120]   But I think there is another level that we wanna consider,
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.840]   and I call it stage six, financial freedom.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.960]   Although I could live at my current lifestyle forever,
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.240]   there may very well be some additional things
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.720]   I'd like to do or some additional things I'd like to own.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.920]   Maybe I'd like to own the lake house
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.440]   and I'd like to go ahead and put a nice ski boat there
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.680]   and maybe a pontoon boat as well, so we have options.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.400]   Maybe we're currently going around
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.800]   and spending our summer vacations in a small travel trailer,
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.280]   but I'd like a luxurious motor home of some kind.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.920]   And I know that that's gonna add another $10,000
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.740]   a year of operating costs.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.960]   And so what I define as stage six financial freedom
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.800]   is simply you lay out
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.040]   all of your personal spending ambitions,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   your personal lifestyle goals,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.960]   and you cover those expenses from your portfolio.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.580]   And when you do that, you're totally financially free.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.700]   You could spend more than what you have right now
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.540]   if you wanted to.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.560]   You could spend more than what you're currently spending.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.680]   And then stage seven is financial abundance,
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.960]   which I think is simply an expression
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.600]   that if you continue to live the way that you're living
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.120]   as an accumulator of wealth,
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.320]   in the fullness of time,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.760]   you're gonna have more money than you need,
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.240]   you're gonna have more money than you want,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.960]   and many people are gonna have more money
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.400]   than they could ever practically spend.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.560]   And that's what I call stage seven financial abundance,
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.400]   which means I have more money than I could ever spend
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.300]   than I want to spend, so now what do I do with it?
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.680]   Money is no longer a constraining factor,
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.280]   but now we move into the point where I have to say,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.480]   I'm the steward of this wealth.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.760]   How do I make sure that this wealth flows
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.200]   to places where it's productive, where it's useful,
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.660]   where it does good in the world?
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.000]   Do I give it to people?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.960]   What do I do with it?
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.520]   And that's what I term financial abundance, stage seven.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.560]   - I really appreciate you walking us through those.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.040]   One of the things that I just noticed practically
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.480]   with clients, this is a simplification,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.160]   but at retirement, there are two kinds of people
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.800]   in the world, and those are the kind of people
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   that are trying with tears in their eyes
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.000]   and by the skin of their teeth
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.160]   to achieve financial security in their late 60s,
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.040]   and then there are those people who come in
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.080]   with financial freedom or financial abundance.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.940]   There's not usually, usually if you're trying to solve
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.680]   for some exact retirement number,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.320]   that's just not the way it works out.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.360]   Instead, people who are accumulators accumulate
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.700]   vastly more than they could ever use
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.680]   based on their own desires and goals,
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.120]   or they're just wondering how they're gonna be able
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.240]   to get by in retirement.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.480]   And so I appreciate you illustrating those stages,
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.840]   and I don't know if that was ever something
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.160]   that you ran into with clients as well,
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.120]   but I see that.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.480]   - I think it is, certainly.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.840]   In my experience, I experienced the same frustration
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   when I worked with individual clients,
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.080]   because it seemed to me that the people
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.200]   who were the most desperate to retire,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.280]   the people who very much wanted to retire,
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.880]   it was very difficult for me to figure out
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.280]   how they could retire.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   And on the other hand, the people who could easily retire
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.680]   because they had loads and loads of money
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.100]   generally didn't have very much interest in retirement.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.920]   Earlier we mentioned the concept
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.080]   of finding work that you like.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.280]   That was one of the lessons that I learned
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.680]   from analyzing the problem.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   I discovered that people who couldn't retire,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   but who very much wanted to,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.480]   were often trying to retire so that they could get away
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.420]   from a life they didn't like.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.960]   They were anxious to stop working at a job
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.860]   that they considered to be a soul-sucking job.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.980]   They were anxious to be able to have more control
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.180]   over their life.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.020]   And yet, that kind of anxiety had often led them
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.860]   to building a lifestyle that sucked up
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.340]   most of their investable cash flow.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.180]   Thus, they didn't accumulate enough wealth
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.700]   to be able to retire.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.420]   Whereas people who started by building a life
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.620]   that they weren't desperate to retire from,
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.260]   they had a job that was a good fit for them,
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.060]   they built a business that they enjoyed running,
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.220]   for them, they accumulated wealth,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.520]   but it wasn't connected to an extremely important goal
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.400]   that at age 63.5, I'm going to retire.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.960]   That's where I've developed the philosophy
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.320]   of starting people, not by trying to figure out
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.060]   how much money you need to retire,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.520]   but by trying to help people imagine
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.960]   what a life that they wouldn't want to retire from
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.100]   would look like.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.660]   What would it look like if you knew
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.260]   that you could never retire?
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.060]   That's the question that I like to ask.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.880]   I've found a lot of value in asking people,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.340]   what would you do if your rich uncle died
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.460]   and left you $5 million tax-free?
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.060]   Well, that's a useful question for you to think about.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.760]   But another useful question that I personally developed
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.780]   was simply, what would you do if you knew
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.060]   you could never retire?
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.120]   What would you do if you knew
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.380]   you would never be able to retire?
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.020]   And I think that when people stop
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.900]   and really consider the answer to that question,
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.980]   generally, what they would do is focus on building a life
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.280]   that they love rather than building a life
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.040]   that they want to escape from.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.680]   And so a simple example, I often hear people say,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.280]   when I retire, I wanna have more time to fish.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.840]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.800]   But did you know that if you like fishing,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.900]   you can go now and build a life
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.720]   where you generate your income as a fishing guide?
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.680]   Or people say, when I retire, I wanna travel a lot.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.660]   Fair enough.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.940]   You can go now and you can build a lifestyle
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.320]   where you make your living traveling.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.800]   It's not easy, but there are many, many ways to do it.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.920]   Everything from starting a tour company
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.640]   where you get paid to organize tours
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.900]   to going and being a work camper, living in an RV
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.580]   as many 60s and 70 year old people
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.440]   all across the United States do.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.240]   And so begin by building a life
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.560]   that you don't wanna retire from,
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.920]   and then bring that into your overall financial plan
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.460]   so that you're enjoying the process of life now
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.960]   while accumulating for the day
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.540]   in which you either choose not to work
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.520]   or in which you can't physically work.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.360]   - Good stuff.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.760]   I think that that first question about the rich uncle
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.100]   lets you answer in your own life
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.080]   whether what you're doing right now
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.620]   is in alignment with who you are and what you value.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.760]   Like how much your life would change
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.580]   if you got the rich uncle result,
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.900]   lets you know maybe how you should be looking
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.080]   to change your life right now.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.520]   And then that other question is a great way
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.560]   to sort of craft your vocation
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.540]   and figure out how to spend your time.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.160]   Well, I brought you on the show for a couple of reasons.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.360]   You have deep formal expertise in the insurance area,
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.040]   but you also founded a podcast
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.800]   called Radical Personal Finance
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.520]   because your views are not entirely conventional.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.480]   And so I am very interested to talk with you today
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.080]   about the big topic of risk management,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.600]   including both the traditional insurance part
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.360]   as well as other ways that ordinary people
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.120]   should be thinking about that.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.200]   So one of the things, because you've gone so far
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.320]   as to build an internet course about this
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.480]   that I wanna ask you about is if you'd share your views
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.280]   on how having money, particularly cash in the bank,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.520]   currency on hand and credit cards
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.480]   is a big part of a risk management strategy
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.240]   within a financial plan.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   - When you think about risk management planning,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.120]   there are some common threads that go through
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.560]   all the different kinds of risks that you're facing.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.200]   When you're trying to prepare for risks,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.800]   you need to start by analyzing, is this a problem
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.520]   or is this a risk that can be solved by money?
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.680]   Or is this not a risk or problem
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.600]   that can be solved by money?
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.560]   Many years ago, I heard somebody say
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.840]   that if your problems can be solved by money,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.680]   they're not actually problems.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.360]   Now, that's probably a little bit too far
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.720]   because certainly money problems
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.880]   have very real consequences in our lives,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.840]   but there's an element of truth
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.400]   that makes us nod along with a statement like that.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   We understand that if my son was just in a terrible accident
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.800]   then it's a very severe problem
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.920]   and I can't just necessarily throw money at the problem
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.760]   and fix it.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.880]   Whereas if I just drove over some broken glass on the highway
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.680]   and I need new tires, okay, it's frustrating
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   and it's an inconvenience, but I can solve it with money.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.120]   And so I like to analyze problems and say,
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.600]   is this a problem that can be solved by money
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.480]   or is this a problem that can't be solved by money?
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.760]   That helps us to understand where our solutions are.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.460]   Now, money will be used to solve
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.120]   all of the problems related to money
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.480]   and it will influence many of the problems
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.760]   that are not directly caused by money.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.700]   You may have personal health problems.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.240]   Well, you can't just simply buy a solution to those problems
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.400]   but your ability to have money
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.620]   will certainly probably contribute to the solutions.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.480]   Money might allow you to take time off
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.620]   from your normal activities, your normal work,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.940]   so you can spend more time focusing on your health.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.160]   Money might allow you to pay for better medical care.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.200]   Money might allow you to get a second opinion.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.000]   Money might allow you to transport yourself
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.320]   to the other side of the world
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.600]   where some novel treatment is being developed
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.760]   for your personal situation.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.400]   And so we can see that even in situations
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.460]   that are not directly caused by lack of money,
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.840]   money is itself useful.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.000]   So if money is useful,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.740]   we need to pay a high amount of attention
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.280]   to how to have it when we need it,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.840]   which comes into the topic of savings.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.000]   And so the basic formal approach to savings
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.320]   is to use an emergency fund.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.720]   When I was becoming a certified financial planner,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.600]   I was taught in my classes that you, as a financial planner,
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.760]   were to recommend to your clients
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.880]   that they generate an emergency fund
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.480]   of three to six months worth of expenses.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.640]   I believe that's good, right?
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.040]   That's a significant number.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.880]   Most people don't have three to six months worth of expenses.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.120]   And the way that you decide whether it should be
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.640]   three months versus six months is you analyze carefully
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.280]   how likely it is that your income would be affected.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.640]   So if you have a household
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.840]   where there's a dual income household with low debt
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.120]   and generally good financial planning,
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.140]   then you say, well, three months of expenses is adequate
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.440]   because if one of you loses your job,
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.840]   the other one probably won't.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.120]   Whereas if you have a household with a single income
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.240]   or perhaps a household where somebody's engaged
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.000]   in a riskier occupation that's more likely to lose income,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.640]   then you point the client towards six months of expenses.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.160]   I think that's important.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.600]   But in my experience, there's a little bit more texture
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.660]   that could really be added to that.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.360]   The first thing is many people
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.200]   keep all of their emergency funds exclusively in the bank.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.840]   And I think that's a real mistake
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.720]   because there are times that you need money
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.560]   and what you need is physical money, physical currency,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   stacks of green papers with dead presidents on them
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.920]   if you're in the United States
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.560]   or multicolored papers in other countries.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.440]   But what you need is physical cash.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.440]   And so there are a number of things that can happen
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.680]   where you need to gain access to cash.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.760]   And if all the money is locked in the bank,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.760]   then it's not available to you.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.020]   So I'm well known for encouraging people
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.160]   to have significant portions of their emergency funds
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.020]   available to them in physical cash,
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.440]   assuming they have a place that is secure and private
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.480]   where they can keep the money.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.800]   You don't wanna be foolish.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.860]   If you're talking to your 18 year old daughter
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.540]   and she has nosy roommates
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.480]   and lives in a college dorm with four other girls,
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.640]   then she should be very cautious
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.520]   about keeping significant amounts of physical cash
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.540]   in her dorm room.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.880]   But that's not the situation that most of us are in.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.440]   So I encourage people to make a list
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.480]   of what are the kinds of things
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.140]   that you might need money for.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.400]   Now, I come from hurricane country.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.420]   That influences a lot of my personal thinking
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.640]   because when the hurricanes come through,
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.680]   everything is shut down.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.520]   The banks are shut down, the ATMs are shut down.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.840]   When the power is out, you can't access money.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.420]   And so I often think, well, how much money would I need
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.160]   to get myself through a couple of weeks without power?
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.700]   You see this when there are other kinds of blackouts.
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.960]   For example, the famous blackout in New York
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.440]   or over the last years,
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.960]   there've been significant blackouts
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.340]   across the United States.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.700]   Well, in a blackout, most of the payment systems
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.440]   that a store relies on don't work.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.820]   The credit card machines don't work.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.620]   They can't accept electronic payments.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.360]   And so they can't take your money.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.400]   And so it may be very important for you to be able
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.800]   to buy something in those times.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.640]   And so some spending money can be useful.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.240]   There might also be expenses
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.880]   that are suddenly forced upon you that are unforeseen.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.760]   I think of what do you do if somebody that you know
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.860]   or somebody in your family goes to prison unexpectedly
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.640]   and you've got to come up with cash bail?
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.220]   Do you have the ability to go and pay bail
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.760]   so that you can spring them out of prison?
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.600]   That might sound like a funny example to use, but it's not.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.920]   It's a very serious example.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.160]   It's the kind of thing that happens to a lot of people
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.040]   and prisons are generally really nasty places.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.720]   And I don't want one of my family members
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.160]   to be stuck in prison a minute longer
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.560]   than is absolutely necessary.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.840]   Other examples as to why cash might be useful.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.720]   Where I find that I use cash the most
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.440]   is simply to take advantage of opportunities.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.840]   You're driving down the road
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.060]   and you see in some beautiful backyard
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.980]   that a guy just put a for sale sign
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.700]   on this really beautiful ski boat.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.640]   And you've been thinking about getting a ski boat
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.820]   and you walk over and you say,
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.020]   "Hey man, tell me about the ski boat."
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.220]   And he says, "Yeah, this was my grandfather's.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.760]   "He died and I'm just putting it out for him.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.800]   "You know, we need to sell it quick
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.580]   "because I need to get, you know, I'm here in Illinois
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.500]   "and I need to get on an airplane
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.260]   "and fly back to Florida tomorrow.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.580]   "But I was figured I'd put it out here
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.860]   "and see if anyone's interested.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.180]   "It's worth 20 grand, but if you give me 10 grand a day,
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.660]   "I'd be happy to sell it to you."
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.620]   I've done this.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.440]   I didn't do it with a ski boat, I did it with a car.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.600]   Where it taught me was I went and I was like,
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.560]   "Okay, I need to go get money."
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.880]   But all my money was locked in the bank.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   And so I'm going to the ATM
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.960]   and I'm trying to take out money,
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.200]   but the ATMs are locked at a stupid 400 or $500 limit.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.880]   And then my bank has the money locked down
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.760]   and I'm going around to 10 different banks
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.000]   trying to get money out of the ATM.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.360]   And I vowed, never again will I not have enough money
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.960]   to buy something that would be reasonable
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.080]   and get myself a deal on something like a ski boat
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.280]   or a car or whatever little toy or something that you need.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.700]   And so those are some reasons that are just practical
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.060]   examples as to why I encourage people to have
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.420]   physical currency as their savings.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.700]   The second component of savings
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.580]   is you want to have substantial savings in the bank.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.540]   There are different ways that you do that.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.960]   And that's, I think, the most discussed part
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.940]   of personal finance, but you want to have the ability
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.980]   to get access to those savings.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.500]   What I would encourage people to think about
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.380]   is setting up in their banking infrastructure
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.700]   a bit of diversity.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.100]   What you don't want to have is all of your money
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.400]   in one bank, in one bank account,
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.560]   and then all of a sudden you get flagged
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.600]   with one questionable transaction
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.320]   and the bank locks your funds down and says,
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.720]   we're not gonna let any more money pass whatsoever.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.760]   I travel a lot internationally.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.640]   I have spoken to many travelers who made the mistake
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.040]   of going off on some long-term adventure.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.880]   I've spoken to people who sail around the world
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.080]   for months or years at a time,
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.240]   or who travel or live outside the United States.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.560]   And all of a sudden, something at their bank
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.800]   gets triggered by some automatic law,
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.600]   some automatic flag.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   Now they have to literally fly back to the United States
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.880]   to talk to their bank,
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.340]   to get their bank to release their own money.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.060]   And it's a catastrophic scenario in some cases.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.340]   I've had this happen multiple times on my accounts
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.420]   where I get triggered, I can't get something out of the ATM,
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.020]   they block my debit card or something like that.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.680]   And then I can't get through to the bank
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.500]   because it's heavy, right?
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.460]   Activity is busy or something like that.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.060]   So you wanna have multiple banks
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.640]   and you wanna think about having access to your money
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.180]   with the form of multiple debit cards
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.700]   would be another example.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.100]   Then the third thing I would point out
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.660]   is the use of credit cards.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.140]   Credit cards are an interesting thing to talk about
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.060]   because they receive a lot of abuse.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.140]   And I think rightly so.
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.300]   Credit cards for many people can facilitate overspending,
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.440]   which is catastrophic to a financial plan.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.940]   There's good evidence to indicate that we spend more money
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.400]   when we swipe a credit card
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.780]   versus when we spend with physical currency
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.980]   or possibly even with a debit card.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.220]   We spend more money.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.980]   It's very easy to make impulse purchases,
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.500]   which if those impulse purchases are for consumption items
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.060]   can often put us in debt.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:12.060]   The terms of borrowing on credit cards are often difficult,
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.380]   come with significantly high interest rates, et cetera.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.860]   We've all known a lot of people
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.260]   who've had a lot of trouble with credit cards.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.340]   On the other hand,
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.060]   credit cards can be an extraordinarily valuable tool
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.060]   if somebody understands their dangers and the risks.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.800]   So when my debit card gets locked
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.960]   and I can't get physical currency out of the bank,
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.000]   if I've got a pocket full of credit cards,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.080]   I have the ability still to spend.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.920]   So when I travel,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.860]   I always travel with a pocket full of credit cards.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.760]   And I put one credit card in my wallet,
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.400]   I put one credit card with my passport
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.340]   secured in another place.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.560]   I put a credit card in my shoe.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.680]   I put a credit card in my bag.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.520]   I put a credit card in my hotel room.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.620]   I just have a half a dozen credit cards that I go with
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.180]   because I've had my stuff stolen.
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.200]   I've had my wallet stolen.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.800]   I've had all those things stolen and it stinks,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.560]   but it's a whole lot easier to handle
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.800]   if you have access to money.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.380]   And so credit cards give you very nice access to money.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.660]   Credit cards also have some interesting benefits
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.520]   that many people don't understand.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.640]   One of the biggest benefits of credit cards
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.120]   is that they are unsecured debt,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   which means that if you don't pay them,
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.440]   there's not an automatic process for somebody
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.520]   to come and repossess your property.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.080]   If you don't pay your mortgage,
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.940]   your mortgage lender can very quickly start
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.360]   the process of foreclosure.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.040]   And within a period of months,
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.320]   you may wind up moving out of your house
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.720]   with the sheriff watching you,
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.280]   making sure that you're gone by the certain date.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.520]   If you don't pay your car payment,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.400]   you may have the unpleasant experience
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.600]   of coming out from your job
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.920]   and watching your car roll away on the back of a tow truck.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.480]   But if you buy something with a credit card,
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.060]   although in time you can be sued,
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.980]   there's no direct connection between the thing that you buy
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.880]   or the money that you spend
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.180]   and the credit card company's ability to repossess that.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.800]   So if I go and I buy a piece of equipment,
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.000]   maybe I'm totally broke,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.920]   and I go and I buy a piece of equipment
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.200]   that I'm using to generate money,
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.400]   then I'm using it and maybe I get hurt and I can't use it
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.760]   and now I'm three months behind,
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.960]   I can still own the piece of equipment
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.600]   until eventually the credit card company sues me,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.440]   possibly gets a judgment against me in court.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.420]   That process is very, very long.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.100]   So credit card debt can be very, very safe debt
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.780]   because it's unsecured debt.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.660]   And that's a powerful thing to recognize
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.520]   when you do disaster planning.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.620]   In addition, credit cards,
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.780]   for somebody with a high credit score
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.920]   and for somebody who understands how the game is played,
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.920]   credit cards can have extraordinarily low borrowing costs,
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.500]   far lower costs than almost any other form of debt.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.360]   Now notice I'm trying to be very clear.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.140]   I'm not saying that they're always that way.
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.380]   Credit cards can very quickly put you at 19.99% interest
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.380]   or 23.99% interest, which is very, very high.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.960]   But if you understand how the game is played,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.740]   and here I'm simply talking about the 0% credit card offers
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.940]   that you get in the mail,
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.500]   and if you understand how to use that system,
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.900]   you can use that system to allow you to borrow money
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.580]   at a very low cost.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.820]   And I teach a whole course on this.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.500]   It's called "How to Borrow Money Safely
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.660]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards."
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.700]   And I teach the details of it,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.180]   because if you put these things together,
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.860]   what a credit card portfolio can allow you to do
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.560]   is it can allow you to keep your money in the bank
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.280]   during times when it's advantageous
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.820]   for it to be in the bank and to use credit cards,
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.300]   and then on the other hand,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.940]   to withdraw your money from the bank when you need it.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.260]   And so for me, for example,
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.740]   the way that I handle my emergency fund
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.800]   is I have some money in physical currency.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.560]   I have some money in the bank,
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.900]   but I keep the bulk of my large emergency funds
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.480]   not just in my checking account,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.540]   not easily connected to my debit card.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.660]   My plan A, if I had a significant form of emergencies,
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.420]   would be to use credit cards.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.220]   I would use 0% credit cards
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.540]   to cover my expenses for a period of time,
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.900]   but I have the money in the bank
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.500]   that I could pay off those credit cards if I needed to.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.340]   And so this allows me to keep my money
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.860]   invested a little bit more efficiently,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.560]   getting slightly higher interest rates
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.300]   than just what the bank may be offering
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.660]   on a savings account,
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.860]   but to do it safely with the backup of credit cards.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.700]   So that's a little bit of a renegade approach.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.720]   Most financial advisors aren't that comfortable with it,
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.540]   and I would point out that it can be extremely risky.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.820]   In my course on the subject, I talk a lot about the risk,
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.700]   and you have to understand,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.500]   is this a good risk for me or not?
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.620]   But having access to money when you need it
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.260]   can be an incredibly valuable asset,
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.020]   and those three different things
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:41.940]   that you want to think about,
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.900]   number one, physical currency when you need it,
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.380]   number two, access to savings due to proper planning,
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.940]   and number three, credit cards
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.180]   can be some of your best ways
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.380]   to actually solve your problem.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.340]   - You've talked elsewhere about how
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.500]   a well-designed financial plan
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.140]   fits with overall risk management goals,
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.700]   and in fact, a lot of those goals
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.320]   are accomplished in that plan.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.820]   And as we sort of begin to broaden up this discussion
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.020]   on risk management,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.180]   I'd like to ask how a financial plan fits
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.060]   with the overall topic of risk management.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.020]   - The first thing that a financial plan should cover
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.620]   is the positive side.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.820]   The financial plan should cover,
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.700]   what are my goals, what am I working towards?
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.080]   As financial planners, we usually use the term
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.420]   in a fairly structured way.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.140]   You know, we have financial planning software,
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.920]   we're doing projections on how long will your money last,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.460]   and we're looking at investments, et cetera.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.580]   I do like to talk about it in a large frame,
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.800]   from the big perspective,
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.900]   because somebody's financial goals
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.100]   should influence their financial plan.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.460]   If somebody has the goal of becoming a billionaire,
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.900]   their financial plan is going to look very different
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.240]   than somebody who has the goal
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.740]   of simply making sure that they're out of debt.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.200]   And so you wanna begin with the positive side,
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.500]   with the goals.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.940]   Then, backing up from those things,
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.740]   you wanna look very carefully at the risk management side.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.920]   So let me use an example like asset protection planning.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.560]   If my aunt comes to me and she says,
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.780]   you know, Joshua, I have a little bit of money,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.020]   I wanna make sure that I'm secure in my older age,
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.700]   and so how can I do that?
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.320]   The plan is fairly simple.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.160]   I'm gonna encourage her,
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.200]   well, you know, make sure you invest the money,
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.320]   let's talk about a good portfolio that's widely diversified,
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.140]   that should be safe,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.040]   should give you the rate of return that you need.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.920]   I'm not gonna get into any kind of exotic packages,
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.300]   any kind of exotic investments,
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.140]   any kind of exotic forms of wealth, et cetera.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.740]   On the other hand, if somebody comes to me
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.060]   and let's say I'm dealing with a very successful
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.600]   35 year old business guy, who's just a total shark,
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.400]   and he says, I wanna be a billionaire.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.260]   Well, in this situation now,
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.460]   I need to think really carefully about the risks
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.980]   that are gonna emerge from his business activities.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.020]   And we're gonna spend most of our time
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.940]   carefully segmenting risk.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.420]   We're gonna make sure that his debt
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.660]   is carefully segmented onto assets
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.540]   that he's not personally liable for.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.760]   We're gonna make sure that he has abundant resources,
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.420]   segmented where his creditors can't access it.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:14.500]   We're gonna do a whole lot of asset protection planning
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.680]   in that situation, because we understand
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.220]   the game that he's playing is probably a lot riskier
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.620]   than my aunt's game, right?
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.340]   My aunt may have a car accident and somebody may sue her.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.500]   That's very different than my big shot shark
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.900]   of a business client, who's going out there
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.720]   and spending all of his time
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.900]   doing global international deals.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.780]   And so the goal is always to say
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.720]   what risks does somebody face
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.160]   and then develop a plan that manages those risks
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.060]   appropriately and at an appropriate cost.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.600]   I don't see how you can get away from it,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.640]   because one of the things that you realize
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.140]   is to do well financially,
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.420]   you don't necessarily have to have a home run.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.420]   There are lots of people who become very wealthy
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.500]   without ever having a home run.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.580]   If you have an abundant amount of time,
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.820]   you can work a job, a standard job that fits you well,
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.320]   that pays you a decent salary.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.280]   You can live well, but modestly.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.900]   You can save and invest.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.260]   You can purchase mainstream investments
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.860]   that are very good, very safe, et cetera.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.700]   And you can do well.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.860]   You don't have to have a home run.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.880]   But what you can't have is you can't have a big loss
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.700]   or a few big losses.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.580]   So a good example would be
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.940]   something like disability insurance.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.700]   If somebody is 35 years old and they're working a job,
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.300]   they're saying, "I wanna retire when I'm 65."
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:38.540]   That plan may work out really, really well,
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.180]   unless they get in a car accident when they're 38
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.400]   and they can't work.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.060]   Then the whole plan falls apart.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.300]   And so you've gotta look and say,
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.740]   "What are the big risks
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.540]   "that can cause this plan to fall apart
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.280]   "and how do we protect against them?"
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.300]   And that to me is what risk management planning is
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.320]   and it's fundamental.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.160]   - Yeah.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.160]   You got right into disability insurance
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.740]   and I feel like it's one of the most likely to be overlooked
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.460]   and something that I always talk to folks about.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.020]   I wanna ask, do you feel like it's wise
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.580]   to only own it through work
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.580]   or are there times when private disability insurance
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.660]   is also very necessary?
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.820]   - I'll give you Joshua's short lecture on insurance.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.980]   If I could only own one kind of insurance, only one,
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.740]   that one kind of insurance that I would own
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.080]   would be disability income insurance.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.620]   I wouldn't own life insurance.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.300]   I wouldn't own health insurance.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.260]   I wouldn't own any kind of car insurance
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.700]   or other property insurance.
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.820]   I would own disability income insurance.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.820]   And that's surprising because I think disability insurance
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.860]   is one of the least owned
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.300]   or if it fails that test
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.380]   due to the widespread use of group disability policies,
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.740]   it's one of the least understood
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.740]   or the least paid attention to.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.880]   But if you think about the things
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.500]   that could happen to you in life,
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.900]   becoming sick or hurt and unable to work
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.140]   is one of the most significant things
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.380]   that has the widest range of consequences.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.180]   Most people go to life insurance.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.580]   Well, I have four children.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.380]   I love my wife dearly.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.280]   But if I die unexpectedly and I don't have life insurance,
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.700]   that would put them in a difficult position.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.960]   But they could figure something out, right?
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.260]   I'm dead, I'm gone.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.740]   My wife could go and could get a better job.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.780]   She could move in with family and they could support her.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.620]   She might remarry.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.860]   There are many number of situations that she could go into.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.220]   And at least the fact that I'm dead and gone
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:32.020]   means that her personal situation is a little bit simpler
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.740]   than it would be if I were still here.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.660]   But if I'm disabled, now things are more difficult
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.220]   because it's harder for her to go and get a job
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.740]   because she's gotta take care of me.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.360]   It's harder for her to move in with family
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.820]   because what if I need a specialized hospital bed
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.420]   for my medical condition?
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.900]   Everything becomes difficult.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.740]   She can't remarry 'cause she's still married to me.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.620]   And so everything becomes more difficult if I'm disabled.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.820]   So if I'm disabled and we still have income coming in,
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.380]   we can make it through.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.180]   But if we don't have income coming in,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.180]   we've got significant problems.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.780]   Or I mentioned health insurance.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.500]   Why do I think disability income insurance
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.260]   is more important than health insurance?
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.580]   Let's pretend that I got sick and hurt.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.980]   I couldn't work, but now I've got to go to the hospital.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.700]   I'm spending significant amounts of time in the hospital.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.160]   In most places, even if I don't have any money,
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.180]   I can be treated for my medical needs.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.460]   My medical expenses can be covered.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.180]   Even if I wind up owing the hospital
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.420]   hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.740]   they'll still provide treatment for me.
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.020]   But if I'm in the hospital
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.700]   accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.100]   and I can't work,
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.800]   and my family's getting ejected from our home,
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.620]   my family has no food to eat,
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.780]   now I've got major, major problems.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.180]   If I have disability insurance,
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.440]   I have money coming in
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.300]   that can cover my living expenses at home,
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.340]   and then I can figure out
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.700]   how to pay off the hospital bills down the road.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.300]   In a worst case scenario, I may declare bankruptcy
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   and the bankruptcy court will remove my obligation
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.900]   to pay those hospital bills.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.180]   So the disability insurance
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.780]   is the cornerstone insurance policy,
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.300]   more important than almost anything else.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.520]   What about car insurance?
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.620]   I have a car accident.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.100]   I commit $40,000 worth of property damage
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.140]   and I owe $100,000 worth of bills.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.180]   Well, if I'm still working, I can eventually pay that.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.840]   I can sell some assets.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.540]   I may eventually bankrupt out of it.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.420]   Bankruptcy is always an option.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.620]   But if I'm not working,
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.740]   nobody's gonna come and pay me income
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:21.820]   if I'm not working
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.660]   because I got sick or hurt and can't work.
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.380]   So disability insurance is the cornerstone.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.660]   Now in the United States,
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.500]   most disability insurance policies
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.860]   come through some form of a group disability insurance plan.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.860]   And I have asked hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.060]   and hundreds of people
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.340]   about their disability insurance plan at work.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.240]   And those same hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.460]   and hundreds of people can tell me nothing about it
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.680]   because nobody understands it.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.300]   They don't understand whether it's good,
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.900]   whether it's bad, what it covers, what it doesn't cover,
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.620]   what it costs, et cetera.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.820]   And so put simply, the answer is it depends.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.940]   You have to analyze the policy.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.740]   Many companies have disability insurance policies
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.420]   that they offer through work that are excellent.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.340]   They're really, really good.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:07.540]   And if the coverage is sufficient
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.660]   for the individual involved,
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.700]   then there's no need for any additional insurance.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.900]   Why pay money for insurance that you don't need?
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.960]   On the other hand,
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.520]   I have reviewed many group disability insurance policies
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.980]   that were truly terrible
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.480]   and they didn't have good coverages at all.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.260]   In which case, the person thinks they're covered,
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.260]   but they're not.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.260]   And the way that you do that
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.260]   is you have to ask some specific questions.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.820]   You have to either read the policy documents
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.100]   or ask some specific questions of the insurance agent
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.820]   or the human resources agent
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.060]   to find out what the policy covers.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.780]   Now, if somebody has a disability insurance policy at work,
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.780]   they may be able to get a small supplemental policy.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.720]   And if they need it, if it makes sense,
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.260]   then yes, it's a good idea.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.220]   The nice thing about supplemental policies
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.940]   is supplemental policies are not constrained to your work.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.780]   If you get a disability insurance policy individually,
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.140]   that policy can go with you in any circumstance.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.020]   I'll give you an example.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.820]   I used to do a lot of work with lawyers
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.780]   and other professions as well.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.020]   What I'd try to do is I'd try to get them
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.300]   to get large individual disability insurance policies
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.420]   that they owned privately,
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.740]   not through their group benefits,
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.260]   but that they own privately.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.980]   Because the nice thing about it is a lawyer
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.100]   is one of the safest, technically speaking,
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.220]   job classifications that you can have.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.500]   And so lawyers can get these awesome policies
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.460]   with amazing benefits at a very low cost.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.980]   And once they have those benefits,
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.900]   they can go to any company, they can travel around,
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.020]   they can start their own firm,
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.380]   and they can still keep their coverage.
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.860]   One thing that's very difficult
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.220]   is when people are starting a new business,
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.980]   it's very difficult to get disability insurance coverage.
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.000]   And yet that's one of the times
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.660]   when you really need it the most.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.980]   And so once you have it,
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.220]   because you got your first job out of law school,
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.980]   you can take it with you even when you go out on your own
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.420]   and start your own practice.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.880]   But in addition, one of the nice things
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.380]   about an individual disability insurance policy
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:53.660]   is it actually goes with you regardless of your job.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.340]   And so I would tell lawyers,
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.500]   and this sounds like an exaggeration,
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.620]   but technically it's not.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.820]   Nobody does this, of course,
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.540]   but technically it's not an exaggeration.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.820]   I would tell them, listen,
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.220]   if you get this policy now
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.880]   that underwrites you individually,
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.660]   this is a guaranteed renewable policy,
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.380]   which means that the insurance company
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.140]   can't take the policy away from you.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.220]   As long as you pay your premiums,
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.100]   they can't take the policy away from you.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.000]   So I said, you've got this as a lawyer.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.060]   You can go and you can start a roofing company.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.300]   And maybe you decide that you can make all kinds of money
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.140]   as a roofer.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.740]   You can go and start a roofing company
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.140]   and you still have this policy.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.280]   20 years from now, you fall off a roof.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.920]   And if you're disabled from the job
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.740]   that you were doing at the time of disability,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.980]   you're disabled from being a roofer
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.740]   because you fell off the roof,
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:37.180]   this policy will pay out because it's an individual policy.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.260]   I don't know any lawyers who actually went
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.660]   and became roofers,
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:43.860]   but I sold a lot of policies with that language
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.440]   because it's technically true.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.420]   And it's really valuable to have the coverage individually.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.580]   So should people have coverage
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.860]   more than what's at their work?
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:52.740]   It depends.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.940]   Depends on the individual analysis,
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.340]   but they definitely, if you can't stop working today
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.980]   and be completely fine financially
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.820]   for the rest of your life,
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.460]   if you're not at least stage,
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.820]   what is it, four, financially independent
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.700]   or stage five, financially independent,
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.800]   if you're not at least there,
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.460]   you probably need some form
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.620]   of disability insurance coverage.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.900]   - So I knew what your answer was gonna be on this one.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.460]   I always talk to clients about this.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.420]   You mentioned sort of the positive reason
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.420]   to have private coverage of going out
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.020]   and starting your own thing.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.780]   That's a great reason.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.940]   One, besides becoming a professional chainsaw juggler,
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.460]   which I had never thought of as a possible career change
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.180]   or roofer for that matter.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.380]   The other one that I think about would be
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:35.100]   if you became disabled between jobs,
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.060]   if you were in a layoff situation
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.300]   is another good reason to have that coverage
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.940]   that's separate and apart from your employer.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.100]   - I think people underestimate
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.740]   how important their income is.
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.540]   I used to use this very simple sales technique
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.340]   when I was selling disability insurance policies
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.440]   and I would draw a picture.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.260]   So just imagine in your mind,
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.100]   my legal pad and my pen,
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.160]   and I would draw a picture on the left-hand side
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.700]   that was your car.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.140]   And I would say, how much is your car?
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.180]   And you would say, it's $42,000.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.820]   And so I would write $42,000
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.620]   and I would ask you how much you spend on car insurance.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.900]   And I would write that below.
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.920]   And you would say, I spend $140 a month on car insurance.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.900]   Then I would talk about your house.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.780]   How much is your house worth?
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.460]   You can say, $340,000.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.860]   And I'd ask you how much you spend on homeowner's insurance.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:16.700]   And then I would ask you,
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.940]   I knew how much money you make and how old you were.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.580]   So I'd take your income,
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.220]   let's say you're 35 years old
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.060]   and you make $100,000 a year.
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.460]   Well, 35 years old at $100,000 a year,
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.860]   30 times 100,000 is $3 million.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.340]   That's the value of your income.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:33.660]   And that's not adjusted for inflation.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.820]   If we give you decent raises for inflation,
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.860]   it's very likely to be 5 million, $6 million
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.500]   that you may earn over the course of the next 30 years.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.220]   And I would just simply say,
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:46.100]   how much money do you spend
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:49.000]   to protect this $3 to $6 million asset?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.180]   And it's a very persuasive picture
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:58.060]   because if you've got $3 to $6 million coming in,
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.500]   you can easily pay for a car.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.740]   If your car just becomes totally destroyed
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.180]   and you have to buy another one, you can easily do that.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.300]   If you destroy someone else's car
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.180]   and you have to buy them another one,
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.780]   if you got $3 to $6 million, you can do that.
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.900]   It's not a big deal.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.460]   If your house burns down
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.740]   and you've got $3 to $6 million of income coming in,
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.580]   you can buy another $340,000 house.
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:17.900]   But if that $3 to $6 million goes away,
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.740]   everything goes away.
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.500]   And it's so important.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.860]   The final point I wanna make on it,
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.540]   'cause you're pushing my buttons intentionally
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.180]   because it's a big deal to me,
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.220]   is people underestimate how much better life is
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.540]   when they're properly insured for disability.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.980]   I had a client of mine who was a,
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.360]   I think he may have been a cardiologist.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.700]   He had been diagnosed with cancer.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.740]   He was 51 years old.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.340]   He'd been diagnosed with cancer.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.820]   And he had a very nice disability insurance policy.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.700]   He was disabled from his ability to work as a physician.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.940]   And so he was collecting disability benefits.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.820]   I think his benefits were something like $15,000 a month.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.260]   When I came along, he was doing fine with his life.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.540]   He had $15,000 a month coming in.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.780]   He was entirely focused on getting better.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.220]   He was doing all these wacky health protocols.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.740]   He was working with his oncologists.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.100]   The rest of the time, he was taking his children
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:10.740]   to work, to school every day.
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.900]   He was spending time working on some personal projects.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.260]   He was playing, he was golfing.
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:15.620]   He was doing all this stuff
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.380]   that he'd wanted to do for a while
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.220]   because he had the money coming in.
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.300]   And the cancer diagnosis,
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.140]   certainly it was a big medical problem,
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.700]   but the cancer diagnosis was not something
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.260]   that changed his lifestyle.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.460]   He didn't have to, in the middle of this health scare,
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.200]   move his family out of their beautiful house.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.900]   He didn't have to immediately pull his children
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.220]   out of their private schools.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.020]   Life was able to go on.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.360]   Having worked with people
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.080]   in some really dire circumstances,
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.980]   just impressed upon me how,
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.360]   if you've got money coming in,
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.300]   when you're sick or hurt and can't work,
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.200]   everything is smoother.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.980]   And it helps you, as we talked about earlier,
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.780]   it helps you to solve the health issue much more easily
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.700]   than if you didn't have it.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.100]   - Last thing on this from my side,
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.880]   and then we can stop banging this drum,
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.580]   is just that I've known some older people who died,
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.300]   maybe had whole life policies in place,
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.500]   managed to collect on those.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.180]   I don't know a single person in my life,
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.580]   there may be, I take it back,
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.200]   I know one person who has ever collected
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.600]   on a term life insurance policy
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.920]   of all the hundreds of people that I know.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.360]   But I just was in another podcast conversation
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.460]   a week or two ago,
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.100]   and the person I was visiting with
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.440]   personally knew two people
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.740]   who had made disability insurance claims
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.180]   within the last year.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.720]   And so it's just, it's a type of event
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.540]   that is statistically much more likely
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.040]   than some other types of insurance claims.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.160]   As we've talked a lot about insurance,
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.200]   I wonder whether you have any thoughts
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.040]   on percentage of income that is reasonable
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.640]   to go towards disability, health,
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.160]   life and property and casualty insurances.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.680]   This is something that comes up with clients
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.780]   because you wanna have some insurance,
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:55.160]   but you also don't want to devote
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.320]   an unreasonable portion of your budget
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.160]   to insurance premium.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:54:59.980]   - Definitely.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.620]   It's a difficult question because
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.600]   I don't know of any of us
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.760]   who like to pay insurance premiums.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.680]   Insurance premiums generally feel like a total waste.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.800]   And so we're usually working
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.760]   to get those insurance premiums as low as possible.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.960]   Now, I think those of us who've lived
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.260]   for a little while understand
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.920]   that when insurance pays out,
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.240]   all of a sudden it's nice to have it.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.560]   But when we're dealing with something
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.520]   like disability insurance or life insurance as well,
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.900]   we probably have less exposure to people
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.400]   who've experienced the benefits of it.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.200]   You and I are unusual in the fact
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.920]   that we talk to people who are experiencing these,
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.120]   but most people don't know that many people
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.840]   who have collected from a disability insurance policy.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.120]   And so it's difficult.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.320]   And of these, I think disability insurance
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.400]   is the more difficult one to reconcile
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.240]   because the premiums are much bigger
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.680]   than life insurance, generally speaking.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.880]   And so let me talk about kind of
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.140]   how I encourage people to think about it.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.940]   The first question that you have to think about
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.720]   is do you need the insurance
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.540]   or do you not need the insurance?
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:01.380]   That's question one.
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.440]   Do you need it or do you not need it?
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:08.160]   If I am 40 years old and I don't have any money in the bank
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.000]   and I've got four children,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   my wife is home with the children
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.360]   and everyone is depending on my income,
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.880]   I need the insurance.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:20.120]   And so it doesn't matter what it costs, I need it.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.600]   On the other hand, if I'm 40 years old
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.600]   and I have $4 million in the bank
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.960]   and we spend $5,000 a month, I don't need the insurance.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.480]   If I got disabled, we could live on the $4 million
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.760]   in the income that that's generating for us.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.200]   I don't need the insurance.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.880]   So question number one is do I need the insurance?
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.840]   Question number two, do I want the insurance?
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.680]   Because just because I may not need it,
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.600]   I might still want it.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.200]   A couple of years ago, I had an experience
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:50.480]   where I bought a truck and I was getting ready to go.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.840]   I bought the truck to pull a camper and I took my family
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.080]   and we lived in a camper full-time
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.820]   and traveled all around the country.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.080]   I bought this truck and I didn't need
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.800]   to put comprehensive insurance on it.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.480]   I only needed legally liability insurance.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.040]   But I ran the numbers and I said,
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.840]   "Yeah, okay, I'll go ahead and put comprehensive
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.960]   and collision on it and cover it properly."
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.280]   It wasn't that much more.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.120]   I didn't need it.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.680]   I could have easily afforded to go out
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:14.760]   and buy another truck if the truck were totaled.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:18.320]   I had the liability covered, but I decided I want it.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.200]   Well, in my situation, it actually turned out
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.760]   very much in my favor because my truck got stolen
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.120]   a week before my trip.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.920]   Literally a week before we were planning,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.240]   my truck got stolen from the parking lot.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.520]   I was having the tinting replaced.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.240]   It got stolen from the tint.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.940]   And the guys that stole it used it to bash
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.000]   into a race car trailer and they wound up totaling my truck.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.280]   And then through some negotiations
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.960]   with the insurance company, I was able to get
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.040]   a very fair settlement for the truck,
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.560]   which allowed me to be more than whole financially
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.900]   when I was in that situation.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.960]   But the nice thing about it was because I knew
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.600]   that I had the comprehensive coverage,
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.800]   comprehensive in collision, I was able
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.120]   to just immediately go out and I bought another truck.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.600]   I wasn't able to leave right on time,
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.680]   but I only left on my trip one week late
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.960]   because a week and a half later, I bought another truck
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.240]   and I knew that I was totally fine.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:15.320]   And so having that insurance coverage made me feel good.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.060]   So I think similar things come into disability insurance.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.980]   One of the reasons we buy insurance is because we want it.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.960]   Now, I said a moment ago that most of us
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.480]   don't like paying for it, but I think genuinely
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.640]   if you get someone in the right frame of mind
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.160]   away from a pushy life insurance agent
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.820]   and you say, think, do you want this?
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.920]   Most of us want what insurance has.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.680]   Why do I have tons of life insurance?
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.960]   Because I want to know that if I'm dead,
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:42.240]   that all of my family's financial goals
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.580]   are still achieved, right?
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:47.120]   I don't want my wife sitting there staring at my casket
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.880]   to be thinking about, well, what am I gonna do for money?
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.920]   Or what other rich guy do I go and marry
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.280]   to support all these children that Joshua and I have?
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.920]   I want her to know that I've got plenty of money
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.380]   and I can do what's right for me
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:00.640]   without regard to the money.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.480]   And I'm happy to pay those insurance premiums
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.300]   because of that.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.140]   So number two, do I want it?
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.920]   Number three is what are the actual premiums
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.440]   and what do I actually need versus how do I actually want?
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.320]   Now, here's the thing about disability insurance.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.480]   Disability insurance is priced more fairly
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.880]   than almost anything else, which means the price
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.340]   of the policy is very much driven by the risk.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.760]   And disability insurance is hard to teach about
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.600]   because it's so complex.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.060]   With life insurance, especially term life insurance,
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:30.300]   people understand it.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.920]   They understand that if I want a million dollars
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.880]   of insurance and I'm 45 years old and I don't smoke,
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.200]   it costs X number of dollars.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.000]   And if I do smoke, it costs more.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.600]   But disability insurance has a lot of options
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.160]   that life insurance doesn't have.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.520]   So the first thing is, what is your job?
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.160]   What occupation do you have?
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.920]   And this is the biggest factor in a policy.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.560]   A lawyer is a 5A classification.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.280]   So the lawyer is very unlikely to be disabled.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.040]   A lawyer who falls in a skiing accident,
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.120]   breaks his leg, is not disabled from being a lawyer.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.160]   Whereas that same person, if the roofer falls
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.840]   and breaks his leg in a skiing accident,
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.740]   is disabled from being a roofer.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.160]   So the lawyer has a lower risk.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.720]   And so the cost of disability insurance
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.480]   for lawyers is much lower.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.120]   The next thing is, how much money do we cover?
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.680]   So a disability policy that gives you $15,000 a month
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.240]   is a very significant risk for the insurance company
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.560]   versus a policy that gives you $3,000 a month.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.960]   You can choose how much money you need.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.000]   And so that's a big thing that you can adjust.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.200]   The third thing that you can use to adjust a policy,
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.000]   you can adjust the policy based upon
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.760]   when the policy benefits start and how long they last.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.840]   You can sometimes have a policy,
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.600]   I guess, usually this is not the realm we're talking about,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.840]   but you can buy a short-term disability insurance policy
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.680]   that will pay you an insurance claim
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.000]   after as little as a week of being disabled.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.360]   So this would be the common thing,
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.560]   Aflac is a big brand name in this space.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.880]   So this is common among blue collar workers
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.560]   where they say, "If I got sick or hurt
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.200]   "and I couldn't work for a week, I'd have a problem."
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.560]   You can buy an Aflac policy,
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.480]   a short-term disability insurance policy
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.840]   that pays you benefits after a week.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.960]   And those policies will usually pay you benefits
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.680]   up to three months or in some cases, six months.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.320]   For most of white collar workers, that's not necessary
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.240]   because you can easily self-insure
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.920]   through two weeks of no pay.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.160]   And for white collar people or wealthier people,
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.880]   generally, you don't even need coverage in that situation
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.320]   because your salary would continue,
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.240]   you have sick days, et cetera.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.920]   But for a blue collar worker,
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.000]   somebody who doesn't have money,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.760]   that kind of policy is a real lifesaver for them
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.960]   if they get sick for a few weeks.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.360]   It keeps their rent current,
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.320]   it keeps their mortgage current,
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.880]   it keeps their car payments current.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.560]   It's very, very useful.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.200]   Now, for somebody with more money,
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.160]   what you can do is you can stretch out the start date.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.840]   So I've sold policies that began
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.900]   after a year's worth of disability.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.080]   And so that makes a big cut in the premiums
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.340]   because if you think about it,
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.480]   how likely are you to be disabled for more than a year?
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.560]   Not very for most of us.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.480]   - You'll either be dead or better.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.320]   - Right, right.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.200]   It's hard to be disabled for more than a year.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.560]   If you have a skiing accident,
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.040]   you might be out of work for two months,
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.240]   but you're not gonna be out of work for a year.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.280]   The kinds of things that disable you for more than a year
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.360]   are a very severe medical condition,
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.280]   very severe heart disease, very severe cancer,
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.420]   or very more frequently, some kind of psychological problem.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.980]   You can't deal with the stress of the job anymore.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.660]   You go through some kind of personal mental trauma.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.900]   You suffer some kind of breakdown.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.340]   You experience early onset Parkinson's disease
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.700]   or something like that.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.940]   Those are the kinds of risks that are more than a year.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.340]   And so if you push the start date of a disability policy
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.660]   out to more than a year,
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.180]   then the premiums drop dramatically.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.540]   The next option that you can adjust
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.420]   is you can adjust how long the policy pays you benefits.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.760]   So you might have a policy
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.080]   that starts after 90 days of disability
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.660]   and pays you benefits out for two years.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.800]   Or you might have a policy that pays you for five years,
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.520]   a maximum of five years, or for a maximum of 10 years.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.960]   But there are policies that will pay you out
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.320]   up through age 65 or age 70.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.200]   And so if you're young, of course,
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.100]   I'd like you to be covered for that up through age 70,
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:09.160]   but that's not strictly always necessary.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.720]   And so if you wanna spend less money
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.840]   on disability insurance premiums,
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.120]   you could simply drop the coverage period.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.800]   And so maybe I'm working with somebody and they say,
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.280]   I've got money in the bank, I've got money in 401ks,
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.540]   I don't have enough to be self-insured,
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.920]   but what I'd like to do is I'd like to cut
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.440]   my disability insurance policy premiums.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.880]   So what I'll do is I'll take a policy
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.160]   with a maximum benefit of five years.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.200]   There's a very small chance that I'll be disabled
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.800]   for more than five years,
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.360]   but five years would give me enough time to adjust.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.020]   It would give me enough time for my wife to get a job.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.440]   It would give me enough time
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.160]   for us to sell our fancy expensive house
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.960]   and move into a more modest apartment
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.600]   so that we could cut our expenses.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.020]   Right now we're living a lifestyle of $12,000 a month,
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:56.000]   but if we had to, we could live on $4,000 a month
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.420]   and five years would give me enough time
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.620]   to adjust our living expenses.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.920]   And then what we would do is we have enough money
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.100]   in our 401k, in our savings, in our one rental property,
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:07.680]   we have enough money from those things
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.980]   that we could cover ourselves at $4,000 a month
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.080]   for the rest of our lives and be totally fine.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.100]   So I'll buy a five-year policy.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.120]   So you can cut the benefit period.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.800]   And then the final thing that you can adjust
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.200]   is you can adjust the definition of disability.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.520]   So you can choose, and I'll use the generic terms
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.180]   rather than any company specific terms,
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.520]   but you can choose a policy that has
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.240]   an own occupation benefit
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.640]   or an any occupation benefit in it.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.800]   An example of an own occupation benefit
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.720]   would be the insurance company says,
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.300]   if you're disabled from your occupation,
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.600]   then you qualify as being disabled.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.500]   So this is very important to the physician,
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.240]   to the attorney, to the white collar professional,
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.040]   because yes, I know that I could go and say,
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.820]   welcome to Walmart in theory.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.200]   I know I could do that in theory and make $1,500 a month,
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.560]   but give me a break.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.560]   I'm making $15,000 a month as a financial planner
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.200]   or as an attorney or whatever.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.380]   And so I want a policy that covers me from my attorney work
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.280]   back to my physician client.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.640]   His policy covered him.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.200]   If he was disabled from being a physician, he was covered.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.540]   He didn't have to sneak around
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:14.240]   and pretend that he couldn't do anything.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.420]   He was golfing, but he couldn't go and be a physician
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.000]   because he couldn't put in the time
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.080]   and the stress associated with that.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.040]   On the other hand, you could always adjust down
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.400]   and you could take a policy that was a catastrophic policy
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.400]   that said, we'll cover you and we'll consider you disabled
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.960]   if you're ineligible to do any occupation
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.560]   or any occupation which is suitable for you
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.000]   based upon education, training, and experience.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.720]   And so those kinds of definitions are much broader
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.000]   and they give the insurance company the ability to say,
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.080]   okay, we understand that you can't be a physician,
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.120]   but could you go and be an accountant?
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.640]   Could you go and provide legal consulting services?
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.480]   So we're not gonna pay you.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.040]   And those all cost of premiums.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.660]   So that's some insight into the world.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.080]   What I would say is what an individual should do
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.520]   is they should answer those questions.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.360]   Do I need it?
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.180]   Do I want it?
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.040]   And they should talk with their insurance agent
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.840]   or their financial advisor about how to adjust the policy
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.120]   to fit them.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.480]   And it's not right or wrong.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.280]   It's a matter of what do you want
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.900]   and what level of premiums is comfortable for you.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.520]   But I think that in general,
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.500]   you have to start with persuading somebody that yes,
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.120]   this genuinely is a very, very valuable asset for me
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.660]   and thus it's worth insuring properly.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.500]   - Great stuff.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.620]   And I'll just note there that one of the things too
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.000]   that I've seen frequently
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.600]   with company provided insurance policies
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.840]   is any occupation definitions of disability
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.680]   within the employer provided coverage.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.240]   Meaning that the employer is really looking
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.160]   to insure the worker in the event
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.960]   that they in some sense become totally disabled
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.420]   and not necessarily insuring their income
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.280]   in the event that they are unable to do
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.480]   the thing that they trained for
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.040]   or the thing that they like to do with their career.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.520]   Today's show is so big, it needs three sponsors.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.120]   First, it's brought to you by Radical Personal Finance
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.040]   where Joshua Sheets provides the knowledge, skills,
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:08.040]   insight and encouragement you need
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.860]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.800]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.640]   in 10 years or less.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.560]   Second, big thanks to Josh Self and PLC Wealth Management
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.640]   for your support of the Life Meets Money show.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.920]   And last but not least,
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.200]   today's episode is brought to you by Matt Miner,
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.080]   founder and host of the Life Meets Money podcast.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.560]   Life Meets Money exists to help you plan to fund
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.760]   the life you love.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.800]   It's the show for MBAs, entrepreneurs
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.280]   and other professionals who want their financial plan
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.120]   to work as hard as they do.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.960]   And with all the discussion of toilet paper,
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   I also tried to contact David Taylor,
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.120]   CEO of Procter & Gamble on Twitter
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.900]   to get him to sponsor the episode on behalf of Charmin,
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.640]   but he wasn't interested.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.240]   Despite that disappointment,
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.340]   you can go to lifemeetsmoney.com/start
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:54.200]   to make sure your backside is covered
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.420]   whenever the next catastrophe happens along.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.920]   Transitioning a little bit from
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.320]   the totally traditional topics to the more fun stuff,
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.880]   I wanted to ask you,
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.500]   physical preparedness is a key part of risk management.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.900]   And sometimes people take this in kind of goofy directions,
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.760]   even neglecting things that they shouldn't neglect
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.240]   in order to do that, which is not my goal today.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.720]   But there are some basic physical preparedness items
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.600]   that should be addressed kind of with the same urgency
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.820]   as an emergency fund and basic insurance.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.160]   And I wonder if you'd talk us through what those are
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.260]   from your perspective.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   - You got about four or five hours here that we can--
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.680]   - I don't know, you're gonna run out of water to sip on here.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.640]   I've seen your cups, they're not as big as mine.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.520]   So you're gonna have to meter your response
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.040]   to match your supply of beverages.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:44.960]   - Exactly.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.120]   So first, let me make the case for physical preparedness,
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.400]   because I think that this is underrepresented
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.600]   in the field of financial planning.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.120]   I believe that money is generally
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.640]   the best form of preparedness.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.200]   I had a friend of mine who coined the term,
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.320]   money is an omni-tool.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.140]   He said that money is that thing
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.320]   that can get you almost anything else.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.440]   And that's true.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.600]   Money can be converted into almost anything in the world.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.280]   The definition I like of money
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.360]   is that money is the most marketable commodity in the world.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.600]   Money is the thing that everybody will accept.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.440]   And so with money, you can buy almost anything out there
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.360]   that you need.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.920]   You can convert money into anything in any circumstance
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.360]   in any corner of the world,
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.600]   unless the marketplace is so messed up
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.200]   that money is not working for now.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.920]   Now, usually that's a temporary condition.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.000]   But if the marketplace is messed up,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   then money is not working for now.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.960]   And so let me give a few examples as I answer your question.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.160]   I think it's very fortunate
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.600]   that we're recording this podcast in the fall of 2020,
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.640]   because if we were recording this in the fall of 2019,
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.280]   people would have been looking at me saying,
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.520]   "Joshua, I don't really get it,
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.640]   but I like to refer to the great toilet paper crisis of 2020
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.200]   and simply say that in the great toilet paper crisis of 2020,
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.660]   we see the perfect example of when money stops working."
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.600]   Now, this is an imperfect example
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.200]   because I don't think there's anybody out there
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.600]   who genuinely went without toilet paper
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.280]   just because the stores were wiped out.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.720]   If you had a $20 bill
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.200]   and you needed a roll of toilet paper for your household,
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.840]   you could walk up and down your block,
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.720]   knocking on your neighbor's doors and say,
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.440]   "I will trade you this $20 bill for a roll of toilet paper."
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.760]   And everybody found somebody
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.920]   who would make that trade with them.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.780]   However, it's illustrative
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:39.520]   because we know that the stores
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.100]   were wiped out of toilet paper.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.360]   This very, very simple, basic thing
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.060]   that many people all around the world use on a daily basis,
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.160]   it's the simplest thing possible,
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.720]   and except it was unavailable
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.840]   for a significant period of time.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.120]   And so what you'll see if you think about that
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.920]   is that this was the easiest crisis in the world to avoid
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.600]   through a simple strategy of stockpiling.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.720]   That any thoughtful person who sits down
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.300]   and confronts the problem and says,
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.140]   "You know what?
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.600]   Something could happen that could disrupt this market.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.840]   Here's this product that we use every day in our household
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.240]   that is a very important, valuable part of life.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.160]   I need to plan and place for
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.760]   if this product doesn't exist."
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.560]   That would lead somebody into a few basic, obvious steps.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.800]   The first obvious step is you set aside
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.680]   a couple extra cases of toilet paper.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.160]   And if you just made a habit
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.680]   of not only buying one case at a time
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.000]   and then waiting till your case was depleted
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.120]   and then going back to Costco and getting another case,
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.700]   but simply maintaining a spot on your shelf
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:45.520]   where you put two extra cases of toilet paper,
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.760]   then you weren't freaking out
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.720]   during the great toilet paper crisis of 2020.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.760]   You knew, "I've got two cases of toilet paper.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.920]   That's two months of toilet paper.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.660]   They'll fix this within two months.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.120]   The market will provide."
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   And so you stockpiled the thing that you needed,
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.520]   and then you weren't worrying
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.160]   when the market was messed up temporarily.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.420]   And so that's a very simple thing,
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.880]   but it was a genuine point of panic for people.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.480]   You could go into Costco during the toilet paper crisis,
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.920]   and you could see people pull up in a Mercedes Benz
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.920]   wearing a Rolex on their wrist, clearly well-heeled,
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.960]   and yet here they are basically tussling with people
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.600]   to try to get the last couple cases of toilet paper.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.200]   That's pathetic if you think about it.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.560]   It's totally pathetic,
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.320]   but a little bit of thoughtful planning could say,
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.260]   "I should stockpile this thing that we use."
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.520]   Now, of course, your plan could be more robust,
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.680]   and if I were teaching this course,
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.680]   what I would say, this is a class,
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.320]   I would say, "Well, let's develop three different ways
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.480]   to meet this need."
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.180]   So you would say, "The first thing I could do
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.480]   is I could stockpile."
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.040]   And so we need toilet paper,
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.480]   so what we'll do is we'll stockpile
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.880]   extra cases of toilet paper,
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.400]   and I would teach someone how to say,
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.120]   "How much time worth of toilet paper do you need?
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.960]   I want three months of toilet paper."
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.120]   You calculate what that is,
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.280]   and you stockpile three months of toilet paper.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.740]   Then we would say, "Well, I wanna protect you,
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:02.800]   so you need a second way to provide for this need."
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.160]   And so maybe it would be something like washable cloths.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.760]   So maybe instead of just buying toilet paper,
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.200]   you buy a large jumbo pack of washable cotton cloths
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.360]   that if necessary, this could be used as toilet paper
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.440]   and then washed afterwards.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.920]   And maybe the third thing is you install
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.240]   in your house a bidet,
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.120]   and whether that's a built-in appliance that you install
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.960]   or something that you would get out,
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.080]   they sell portable bidets, something like that,
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.800]   you have the ability now to manage this basic human need
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.040]   in three different ways
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.640]   if the market doesn't deliver for you.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.760]   That's good preparedness planning.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.960]   That's robust preparedness planning.
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.320]   But the point is that all of those things
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.280]   are easy to do before the fact,
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.160]   but they're hard to do after the fact.
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.800]   And so life continues,
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.720]   and things can be much more dire.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.800]   So let's give another example.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.960]   The toilet paper crisis is funny,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.920]   because it's a little bit of a difficult thing
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.840]   for us to talk about,
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.920]   because it's a little bit off color,
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.880]   but we lived through it,
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.400]   which is why I like to start with it.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.360]   But what about something like a building fire?
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.200]   Maybe you work downtown and you recognize
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.840]   that there could be a building fire.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.040]   Recently, we've celebrated the 19th anniversary
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.880]   of the 9/11 attacks.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.560]   So I want you to imagine you work in downtown New York City,
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.920]   and it is possible that there could be a terrorist attack,
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.280]   or it's possible that there could be rioters
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.320]   setting fires outside your office,
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.960]   or it's possible that the power could go down,
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:27.060]   and the elevators might not work.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.360]   So do you have a plan that you could get safely
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.960]   out of your building if the fire alarm goes off,
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.340]   or if you turn on the news and see that an airplane
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.080]   has flown into a tower?
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.040]   Well, I think this is an important area of discussion,
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.960]   and so it starts with the simple things.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.760]   Now, you've got all the money in the world,
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.640]   but do you have a pair of comfortable walking shoes
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.240]   at your desk?
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.240]   There are legions of office workers, male and female,
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.960]   who wear the most stunningly beautiful fashionable shoes
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.720]   to work every single day.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.120]   And I like fashion.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.400]   I like my nice leather dress shoes.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:02.720]   I don't wanna walk five miles out of downtown New York City
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.320]   in my nice dress shoes.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.400]   I don't want my wife with her three-inch heels
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.000]   to try to walk five miles out of downtown New York City.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.400]   And so preparedness planning is very simple.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.040]   You say, here, I've got a pair of walking shoes,
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.000]   or tennis shoes, or sneakers, or whatever,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.280]   that these are getting a little bit ratty.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.840]   I'm just gonna take these to work,
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.960]   and I'm gonna tuck them into the back corner of my drawer,
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.940]   in my desk, or down in the filing cabin,
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.800]   or in the break room, or something.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.920]   And then, if there's a fire alarm,
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.600]   I'm gonna discipline myself to immediately stop,
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.960]   take off my high heels, or take off my dress shoes,
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.620]   and put on these walking shoes,
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.400]   so that I can walk down 35 flights of stairs
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.120]   and walk out of the building.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.000]   That's a very simple thing,
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.920]   but it can possibly save your life,
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.800]   as it allows you to quickly escape a building
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.520]   before the building collapses.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.040]   And I'm not being at all flippant with this.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.480]   This is real stuff.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.240]   So you wanna think about these things that could happen.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.600]   Your biggest priority, generally, is to get home.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.720]   And so you think about, what would I do?
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.880]   How would I collect my children if, all of a sudden,
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.840]   there were some major physical emergency
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.360]   declared in my town?
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.360]   Right, I've gotta figure out how to get out from work.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.680]   I've gotta figure out how to get to my children's school.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.760]   How could I do that?
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.600]   What would we do?
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.600]   And you sit down, and you talk with your spouse,
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.840]   and you make a plan.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.760]   Here's what we'll do.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.400]   If there's an emergency, if there's a threat of some kind,
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.100]   it could be a snowstorm, or an ice storm,
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.700]   or any number of things, you're gonna go,
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.220]   and you're gonna get our son from that school.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.480]   I'm gonna go and get our daughter from this other school.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.680]   And then we're gonna get home.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.200]   Well, how are you gonna get home?
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.020]   So, again, I said I could teach a four or five hour class
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.800]   on it, but if you start thinking through these questions,
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.360]   what you find is you find some very consistent solutions.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.640]   And so let me just give an example here
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.360]   from the perspective of the office worker.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.680]   If I worked in downtown New York City,
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.400]   but I lived in the suburbs,
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.860]   whether it's across the river or not, who knows,
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.800]   I lived in the suburbs, or if I commute to any downtown,
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.160]   New York's hard because so much is public transportation,
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.200]   I would think this through, and I would start
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.420]   by having a pair of comfortable walking shoes
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.920]   and a good pair of socks,
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.960]   so that if the electricity goes out
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.960]   and the subways aren't working
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.680]   because the electricity's out, I can walk.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.840]   More importantly, I would do something simple.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.560]   Like, I might be personally, if I were commuting,
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.680]   I would keep a folding bicycle in the trunk of my car.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.800]   So if I've got a folding bicycle and I need to get home
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.480]   and I need to go and collect my children,
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.500]   then I have the ability to simply go to the trunk of my car
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.480]   and maybe the roads are jammed or there's an earthquake,
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.120]   right, maybe you live in an earthquake zone,
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.040]   and I would have a bicycle.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.160]   Of course, the primary goal is the car.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.640]   And so I always make sure that I keep my car
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.760]   with at least a third of a tank or a half of a tank
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.600]   or a quarter of a tank, so you pick some number.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.320]   So you never wanna find yourself in a situation
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.760]   where you don't have gas in your car.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.940]   You wanna have a couple ways of getting yourself home.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.600]   You have walking shoes, you have a bicycle, you have a car.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.280]   You wanna know how to get there.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.000]   So if you look at a map,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.760]   and you don't have to necessarily go and walk it,
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.640]   but how would I get home if the bridge was blocked?
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.040]   Right, I'm thinking about 9/11
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.440]   because of all of the recent media stuff,
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.000]   but the bridges are blocked, the roads are closed down.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.080]   Everything is stopped.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:04.920]   How do I get there?
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.920]   I have to physically walk out of the city.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.220]   So do I know where to go?
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.000]   And I would keep some basic provisions.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.640]   Back in the 1800s, there was this horrible ice storm
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.540]   that came in the Midwest
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.440]   that wound up killing hundreds of students
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.120]   because they went to school in the morning,
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.020]   it was very warm, and the temperature plummeted
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.700]   something like 60 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:26.360]   within the course of an hour and a half or two hours.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.640]   And I'm not exaggerating.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.000]   It was this catastrophic scenario.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.940]   And so all of these children were walking home,
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.680]   and they died of exposure
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.960]   because of this catastrophic plummeting temperatures.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.300]   So imagine you're at work.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.920]   What would you need if you needed to hole up
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.920]   in your office for a day or two?
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.000]   Maybe there's a catastrophic ice storm,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.760]   and it's not safe for you to go home.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.800]   Wouldn't you rather simply be able to call your,
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.280]   an ice storm is a good example.
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.840]   Many people die in accidents when they're driving home.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.040]   Wouldn't you rather call your wife and say,
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.960]   "It's not safe to drive right now.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:57.800]   "I'm at the office.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.240]   "We're totally fine here.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.560]   "I'm just gonna stay here at the office until tomorrow
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.560]   "till they get the roads clear,
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.500]   "they get the roads salted or whatever happens,
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.980]   "and I'll see you tomorrow."
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.260]   And so I would keep in my office,
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:08.720]   I would keep a couple gallons of water,
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.520]   I would keep a little bit of food, some snacks,
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.580]   some basic things.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.580]   You could maybe stick a wool blanket somewhere.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:18.380]   And now you've got an office emergency kit squared away.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.180]   Other things like a first aid kit.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.000]   Whenever I go hiking with my children,
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.260]   I always carry a first aid kit
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.180]   because I don't wanna be that father
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.400]   who is sitting there with a child
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.140]   that slipped and fell on a rock and now has a bloodied knee
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.060]   who doesn't have anything at all.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.580]   And so having a first aid kit with you
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.500]   when you go in the woods,
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.780]   having a first aid kit in the car with you.
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:39.980]   If you're gonna go deep in the woods,
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.540]   making sure that you have a way to get out.
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.860]   Your cell phone is great,
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:44.580]   but what if you're beyond cell phone distance?
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.860]   So simple thing like having an emergency locator beacon
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:50.600]   is not difficult to have, costs a couple hundred bucks,
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.100]   but you read a story about a guy
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.780]   who was the guy that was out hiking and rocks fell
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:57.340]   and he had to cut his arm off because he got caught.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.560]   That's awful, right?
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.980]   And I'm glad he got out and he didn't die.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.580]   Better to be alive, less one arm
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:07.260]   than to not be alive at all, but that's terrible.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.300]   And so with those of us who have enough money,
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.420]   it's not hard to spend a couple hundred dollars
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:13.940]   and put an emergency locator beacon in your backpack.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:16.340]   So if a rock falls on you and you're stuck,
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.460]   you pull out your backpack,
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.940]   you pull out this flexible antenna,
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.260]   you point it at the sky and you press SOS
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:22.580]   and the emergency people show up
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.980]   two or three, four hours later and they rescue you.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:26.420]   These are all just components
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:28.360]   of emergency and disaster planning.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.780]   There's plenty of good education out there available.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.460]   And so I don't wanna go more than that,
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.740]   but it's important that we think about it
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:39.260]   because there are times in which money doesn't work.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.380]   And in those times at which money doesn't work,
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:45.200]   your physical preparedness will make the difference,
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.660]   maybe not between you're surviving or not surviving.
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:51.140]   That's rare, but it does happen, but it's rare.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.700]   And I don't like to be so apocalyptic
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:53.900]   and say, you're gonna die.
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:54.720]   You might, right?
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.940]   And we wanna avoid that.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:59.380]   But what I would say is your physical preparedness
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:02.180]   can make the difference between something being
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.580]   a perhaps dire and in most cases,
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.660]   very uncomfortable experience
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:12.740]   versus being a minor inconvenience, a minor nuisance.
[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.620]   It's not always life or death,
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.520]   but you can turn a very uncomfortable experience
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.380]   into a minor nuisance.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.220]   And to me, that is worth it.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.420]   That's worth it to pay attention to
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.760]   and to engage in good personal preparedness planning.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.800]   - I have a couple of things I wanna share back
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.340]   by way of response.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.700]   The first actually relates to you again.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.840]   I don't remember the exact day,
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:38.220]   but it was around February 24th or February 26th.
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:40.820]   You released a show on COVID
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.480]   and what you saw that was coming.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.620]   And it was before,
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.380]   COVID was certainly in the news at that point.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:49.540]   It's been in the news since January.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:51.540]   We didn't really know what the disease was gonna be like.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.820]   And we can criticize all we want,
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.900]   the policy responses through the spring of 2020
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:58.300]   in the United States.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.920]   Around that time, I went to Costco.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.020]   I did buy toilet paper extra,
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.420]   even though we had a case already
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.380]   and stocked up on some food.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.420]   And the result of that was that we didn't go to Costco
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:11.260]   for about four to five weeks in the first part of COVID
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.780]   'cause we were all still grappling with
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:14.700]   what does it mean to live in these conditions
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.460]   and exactly how bad is this thing?
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:21.020]   Anyway, so I wanted to say nice shot on calling that one
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:24.460]   in time that our family was able to do something about it
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.700]   specifically because of that show,
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.460]   even if toilet paper was the only thing
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:29.780]   that we had plenty of.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.180]   And then the other thing was that like
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.020]   through these principles of lifestyle design
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:36.140]   that are so important to me and to you,
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:37.200]   we live where we want
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.260]   and we have the stuff that we want around us.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:43.140]   And it was no great hardship for us to be here at the house
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.640]   and have our things and have each other.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.720]   We certainly missed social interaction
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.820]   and seeing the people that we love.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:51.900]   But because we'd put some thought
[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.220]   into the preparedness stuff
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.540]   and then also into designing the life that we want,
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:59.580]   it was really, we are thankful to say,
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:03.980]   much more of a non-event than so many people experienced.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:06.540]   - Yeah, and I think that it's important to focus on that
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.980]   because as we record this in the fall of 2020,
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:14.260]   COVID is much clearer than it was in the spring of 2020.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:15.820]   It was not clear at the time
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.820]   what the actual circumstances were.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:21.020]   It was not clear how bad the disease was going to be.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:23.140]   It wasn't clear what the risk was.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:24.680]   It simply was not clear.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.740]   You had videos coming out of China
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.540]   of people dead on the street and you're thinking,
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.740]   are we dealing with a minor flu
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.940]   or are we dealing with Ebola, right?
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.780]   There was just no way to know.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.740]   And that's normal.
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.580]   That's a normal part of most disasters.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.940]   It's unclear.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.700]   And so to me, what I would encourage
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.200]   every one of your listeners to do
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.440]   is to learn the lessons from COVID
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.740]   because while COVID is definitely a significant pandemic,
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.820]   I'm personally persuaded at this point in time
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.580]   that we dodged the big one, right?
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.240]   That COVID is not going to be the big one.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.020]   That sounds a little bit harsh and uncaring
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.440]   when you're dealing with hundreds of thousands
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.540]   of people dead around the world as we speak.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.140]   And this is going to continue for a long time.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:11.140]   But it's a matter of fact that it could have been far worse.
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:13.180]   If we look at these examples,
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:16.620]   it shows us what we need and what we don't need.
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:19.380]   When we analyze a subject like COVID,
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.640]   it gives us a good war game, right?
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.580]   A good test that we can look at.
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:27.980]   And now we're close enough to those early days
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.980]   that we can remember what happened,
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:32.640]   but we're far enough away that we can make plans
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.140]   for the next thing.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.180]   It's important to look at it and to recognize
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:41.300]   that although this one case didn't turn out to be dire
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.780]   for most of us, right?
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.500]   I want to be thoughtful and respectful in my language,
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.940]   especially towards those who have become sick by it
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.820]   and faced death from it.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:51.680]   But speaking very broadly,
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.220]   although in many cases for many families,
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.100]   it's not the physical sickness,
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:58.140]   you didn't know that at the beginning.
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.020]   And so you were able to be cautious at the beginning
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:03.740]   if you had good physical preparedness in place.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.140]   So let me use another example.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:09.260]   If you have food in your house so that you know
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.700]   that when the ice storm comes,
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:12.560]   you don't have to run to the grocery store
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.340]   to stock up on milk and eggs,
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.820]   it may very well keep you from being out
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:20.060]   in dangerous conditions that can result
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:22.120]   in a bad car accident or death.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.360]   If you have food in the house and your boss,
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.800]   or sorry, if you have money in the house
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.480]   and you're not living on the razor's edge financially,
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.560]   and your boss says, "You better get down here today
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.380]   "because I need you, but you know it's not safe
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.700]   "for you to drive."
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:37.960]   You say, "I'm sorry, boss.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.980]   "I want the job, but I can't come in safely today.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:42.400]   "I'll come in another day."
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.600]   And you can do that.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.320]   And so when you pull back from being
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.400]   at the very edge of risk,
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.980]   when you minimize your exposure
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.620]   because you don't have to go to Costco
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.660]   with the crowds in the early days of the pandemic
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:56.900]   when you're not sure how bad it is,
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:58.340]   and you can stay at home,
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:01.100]   you can make everything better.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:05.780]   And on almost every level of emergency that can happen,
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:06.620]   that improves things.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.020]   So for example, you're better off getting COVID
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:13.060]   in September of 2020 than you were in March of 2020
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:15.100]   because now the medical professionals
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.940]   have a much better understanding of the therapies
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.060]   that are gonna help you beat it
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:20.320]   than they did in March.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.800]   And so if you could sit home and minimize your exposure
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.240]   for that period of time,
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:28.880]   you maximize your probability of surviving the disease
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.640]   and of thriving during the disease because of that buffer.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.160]   So I don't wanna go on with example after example.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.120]   I just wanna emphasize that these things
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.280]   work harmoniously together,
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.760]   that physical preparedness and financial preparedness
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.040]   make otherwise catastrophic situations
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.600]   non-catastrophic,
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.960]   and they make difficult situations more comfortable.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.220]   And although we often feel a little bit of guilty
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.440]   to say what you said, Matt,
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.100]   I say the same thing that, hey, it hasn't been that bad.
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:00.920]   I think it's important to say it
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:04.480]   with appreciation for the benefits that we have,
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.120]   but it's also due to good planning.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.100]   COVID has not been a hardship for me and my family
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.200]   because we have a lifestyle that is designed to be resilient.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.780]   It's been frustrating, it's been annoying,
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.040]   but it hasn't been a hardship.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.460]   My marriage is not on the rocks
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:20.340]   because of constant fights and strains.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:22.060]   My business is not in shambles,
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.340]   and our household is not filled with sickness,
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.920]   but it's because of taking the prior steps of planning
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.680]   that have made everything smoother
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.440]   and turned a difficult situation
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.440]   into more of an inconvenience rather than into a catastrophe.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.720]   - All right, well, I think that we have
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.760]   about plumbed the depths,
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:42.200]   at least relative to what we can handle in a single show,
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.600]   some of this risk management and expanded that
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.120]   beyond both traditional financial planning
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:49.460]   as well as products like insurance.
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:52.240]   I'd love to just take a minute and ask you
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.560]   where you're at with Radical Personal Finance these days
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.000]   and where you see it headed in the future.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   In specific, I'm curious how you see it going
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.700]   in the next year or two,
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.960]   and what's a stretch goal for you
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.920]   that would represent you
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.480]   exceeding what you dreamed about there?
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.440]   - When I started Radical Personal Finance,
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.080]   I loved the format of a podcast.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:17.960]   I feel that a podcast, meaning an audio podcast,
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.160]   is one of the most effective tools of communication
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.760]   and education that is available.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.720]   Audio is much more accessible for most people to create
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.360]   than is video.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.160]   Audio is easier to consume than is video
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.640]   because you can do it while you're doing other things.
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.760]   And so I had this dream that I would be able to provide
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.400]   a world-class financial education in an audio podcast.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.160]   And I think I've done a pretty good job with that.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.600]   The audience has appreciated what I have done.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.780]   What I learned over time is a few things.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:51.560]   Number one, while an audio podcast may be good,
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.360]   it doesn't get nearly as wide of an exposure
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.360]   to the marketplace as other forms.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:00.520]   And so from the exposure side of things,
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.240]   I'm trying to figure out how I,
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.560]   with the skills and abilities that I have,
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.000]   can provide excellent educational content
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.640]   in a format of audio, also in a format of video,
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.160]   and also provide more written content.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.320]   That's number one.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.240]   Number two is I've learned that while I can create
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:20.560]   a lot of valuable education in an audio podcast,
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.600]   it's often too unwieldy at answering people's questions.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.840]   And so what I need to do is I need to create
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.360]   more focused, specific courses
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.980]   that answer people's questions.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.320]   And so in the beginning, I thought,
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.320]   oh, I'm gonna give it all away for free.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.660]   Well, now what I understand is that there's no way for me
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:40.240]   to give it all away for free because the answers
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:43.520]   that people are looking for get mired and buried
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.760]   in the sheer volume of audio files to wade through.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.200]   And so I'm trying to do those,
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.720]   I'm working on doing those two things.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.160]   Number one is I'm increasing my exposure
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.940]   with more formats to attract people.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.500]   And number two is I'm building high quality courses
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.140]   that answer specific questions that people have
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:05.420]   so that the education is tailored to the specific need
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:07.720]   that they're in at the moment so that they can have answers.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:10.320]   So those are my projects for 2020 and 2021.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.320]   - All right, good deal.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.160]   I wanted to ask you, Joshua, what do you love
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.520]   about where you are today with life, work, and money?
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520]   - Years ago, I had a dream.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:23.560]   I do all these weird goal setting exercises.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:27.080]   I would do this dream where I imagined my day,
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:27.960]   my perfect day.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.760]   I do this journaling exercise where I just think
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.800]   through my perfect day from beginning to end,
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.600]   exactly what I would do.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.600]   You know, I imagine myself lying in my bed
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.040]   and I open my eyes and I look around
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.000]   and I see where am I and what do I do?
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.640]   And I go through the whole day.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.720]   And that perfect day for me had a number
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.320]   of important components.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.840]   One of those components was for me to do work
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.760]   that I cared about.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.360]   I love to educate, I love to teach,
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.120]   I love to engage with people.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.200]   To be able to do it entirely free
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.480]   of any kind of scheduling encumbrances.
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.400]   I spent many years as a financial advisor,
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:00.320]   you know, with 25 to 30 appointments scheduled
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.840]   every single week, major constraints on my time
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.080]   with, you know, scheduled weeks out.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.720]   And I didn't want a high scheduled life
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.960]   and I wanted to be able to live anywhere in the world.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.240]   I wanted to be able to run a business anywhere in the world.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.640]   And so I dreamed that a number of years ago
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:15.960]   and I have achieved that.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.320]   And it genuinely is great.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.560]   It's not perfect.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.800]   I've come to realize some of the things that I miss
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.820]   about a more traditional looking lifestyle.
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:28.400]   Some things I miss about being in an office with coworkers.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.260]   There's things that I miss about being anchored
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.440]   to one place.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:35.040]   But I've been able to build a lifestyle
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.640]   that is more free than anybody I know.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:40.480]   Where I can come and go on a daily basis,
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.340]   how I like, when I like.
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:44.940]   I can come and go anywhere in the world.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.840]   I can do very well.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.800]   I can do work that matters to me.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.980]   It's just a total blessing.
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.200]   It's a real blessing.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.280]   I believe that these are some of the opportunities
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.660]   that we have in the modern world
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.080]   because I'm not financially independent.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:00.080]   I can't live on the income from my investments yet.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.260]   I'm not there yet.
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.480]   But I feel like I'm already living the lifestyle
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.520]   that I would live if I were financially independent.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:10.440]   And to me, to have the ability to build that,
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.960]   I'm not in my mid-30s.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.440]   To have the ability to have built that,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.160]   'cause I've been living that since I was 30 years old
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.720]   or a little bit earlier,
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:22.880]   is just a remarkable statement on the golden age
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.700]   that we're living in.
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:27.320]   We're genuinely living in a golden age in human history.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.760]   There is more opportunity for us now
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.940]   than there has ever been before.
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.440]   There's more financial opportunity
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.840]   than there is now than ever before.
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.840]   Global wealth is increasing at a rate
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.100]   that's never been seen before.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.280]   We live better than ever before.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.080]   And so we're living in a golden age.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.240]   And it's such a blessing to be able
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.080]   to have benefited from that
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.960]   and to be able to help other people benefit
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.000]   from this time that we're living in.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.200]   - Good deal.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.080]   So this is a show, it's all about learning
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.600]   from the experience of others.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:57.320]   And I wonder, how do you reflect on your decision
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.280]   to go all in on podcasting in summer of 2014,
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.480]   which was a big choice that you made at that time.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.740]   And then of course we could say expanding more broadly
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:09.020]   into personal finance media, since that time.
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.480]   - When I decided to go all in on podcasting,
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.800]   it was a difficult decision for me.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.760]   It was a very expensive decision for me.
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.000]   I had to close a financial planning firm
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.860]   that I'd spent five years building.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.600]   I had to walk away from my residuals.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.720]   I had to leave clients that I cared deeply about.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.160]   And I had to walk away from all of it.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.240]   It was extraordinarily expensive.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.040]   But at the time I did it when I did it for two reasons.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.480]   Number one, I feared having regrets.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.260]   I saw the marketplace, I knew what was happening
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.520]   and I feared having regrets.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:45.360]   I feared not acting and how I would kick myself
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.560]   for not acting years later versus acting.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.160]   The second thing was I saw what was happening
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.800]   in the marketplace and I saw the timing
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800]   that was in the marketplace.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.520]   And for me, this has always been something
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.680]   very difficult for me.
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.920]   I have always come from a fairly mainstream
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.080]   financial background, mainstream investing background.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.040]   I'm a very conservative guy.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.600]   But I would read biographies of people
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.240]   who were very wealthy and I observed that
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.020]   what's necessary is that when you see something,
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.800]   you have to take a bet on it.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.060]   That if you read the biographies
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:16.040]   of wealthy, successful people,
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.520]   they see an opportunity and they take the bet.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.080]   You have to actually take the shot.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.680]   You know, we can of course recite the famous quote,
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.560]   you miss 100% of the shots you don't take, but it's true.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.080]   And so when I was looking at podcasting,
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.520]   I said, this is a shot I need to take
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.520]   and I'm glad I did because I hit the timing right.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:37.760]   I rode an increasing wave at a certain point,
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.040]   technologically, socially, et cetera,
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.560]   and that laid the foundation for me.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:47.160]   For me, having had the confidence in myself to do that
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:50.120]   was a formative thing in my own personal life
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.920]   because it caused me to come to trust myself
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.760]   more than I previously did.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.200]   When I started Radical Personal Finance,
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.880]   nobody agreed with me.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.880]   Not that people were disagreeable,
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:05.480]   but most of my advisors didn't understand.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.840]   They didn't know what I knew.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.440]   They didn't understand the marketplace
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.120]   like I thought I understood it.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.120]   And so I had to take the bet basically on my own,
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.720]   which as a man, I'm incredibly grateful that I did it.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.580]   And I've continued to take bets on my own,
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:23.640]   do things that other people didn't understand.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:26.880]   And as every time I do that, I see the benefits
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.000]   and I see that it builds my confidence
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.520]   and allows me to trust my own judgment more.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.280]   And so that's been incredibly valuable.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.840]   Along the way though, I continue to see the benefits
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.160]   of good financial planning
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.720]   because while you have to take some risks in life,
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:44.560]   you can dramatically minimize the effects of those risks
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.880]   with good financial planning.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.160]   I'm not willing to take a wipe out risk.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.760]   And so good financial planning allows me to feel confident
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.240]   that it's very unlikely, I won't say impossible,
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.920]   but it's very unlikely that I'll ever be wiped out
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.680]   because I don't take wipe out risks.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.680]   And to me, that's a very useful and valuable lesson
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.740]   that I have learned early enough in life
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.000]   where I hope it'll continue to pay off
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.600]   throughout my entire lifetime.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.840]   - Awesome.
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:15.040]   It's a pretty different landscape now than it was in 2014.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.400]   And I wonder how you think people like me
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.880]   in the financial media space should think forward from 2020
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.120]   rather than looking back at the playbook from five years ago.
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.520]   - That's a complex question
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.200]   because it's covering multiple levels.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.940]   On the one hand, it's harder to break out in 2020.
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.240]   We live now in a world
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:38.520]   where independent media creation is normal.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.220]   Almost all of your listeners have a media creation device
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:44.240]   in their pocket or in their hand at this moment.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.760]   And that media creation device is single-handedly capable
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:52.480]   of making world-class audio, making world-class video.
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.440]   It's capable of broadcasting to the entire world
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.000]   at a single moment.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.920]   You can make a living, you can make a six-figure income
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.000]   with nothing more than a Twitter account.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.960]   And I'm not exaggerating with that.
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.560]   If you have interesting things to say,
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.000]   and if you can generate value, people,
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.360]   you can generate six figures
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.640]   from any corner of the world with a Twitter account
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.120]   and a couple other ways to collect money from people.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.560]   But in that context, what I think it means, though,
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.880]   is there's more of a desire for high quality.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:26.880]   And so the exposure is good because it builds the audience.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:31.240]   The potential listener base for your podcast
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:34.300]   is far bigger today than the potential listener base
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:37.360]   for my podcast was in 2014.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.420]   But what it means, though,
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:42.920]   is that we have to create better stuff that attracts people.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.560]   And we have to learn the new tools of the marketplace.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.960]   And that's where it's difficult.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.280]   I think that most of us probably wish sometimes
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.080]   to go back to a simpler life.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.440]   I certainly do.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.840]   It seems it's so difficult to keep up in the modern world
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.120]   because the pace of change is so fast.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.520]   The things that worked in 2014 do not work anymore.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.640]   And the things that work in 2020 will not work in 2022,
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.920]   which means that all of us have to be
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.960]   on the top of our game.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.720]   None of us can sit.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:13.200]   We get to choose our mindset, though.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.680]   We can either regret that or we can embrace it.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.960]   I think it's much more powerful to choose positivity
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.180]   and choose to embrace it than not.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.960]   And so I don't have all the answers.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.760]   Although I had an earlier start,
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.080]   I've not executed well on all the things
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.440]   that I need to execute on.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.600]   And so we're in the same position.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.680]   What's remarkable, though, is that in 2020
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.980]   is that when we do things right,
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:39.200]   when we do things effectively,
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.280]   the growth rates can be astronomical.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.720]   And I think that it's important to be gentle with ourselves
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.040]   and to be important to be willing to try things,
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.240]   multiple things.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.180]   I've recently just simply recognized a number of people
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.680]   whose stories where they've had these major successes.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.780]   But what I have found when I've researched
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:59.020]   is that the major success came after three other failures.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.520]   And I've seen this with a number of media brands
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.380]   where they did this, didn't work.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:04.640]   They did that, didn't work.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:05.640]   Did the other thing, didn't work.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.160]   And then all of a sudden they tried something new
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.840]   and boom, it worked.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.840]   And so I would point out that you don't need the home run
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.320]   to be successful, but by continuing to try
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.580]   and to put yourself in the position
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:20.040]   where you can take pitches,
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.040]   there's a better chance that you will be able
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.000]   to find the home run.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.200]   So that's a bit of a nonspecific answer to your question,
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.480]   but it's my answer for right now.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.840]   - No, I think that's great.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.080]   So Joshua, what's one piece of advice
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.480]   that you've benefited from in life
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.180]   or that you'd like to share today?
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:39.760]   - One great skill that I think all of us can develop
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.760]   is the skill of weighing alternative courses of action.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.040]   As human beings, we have a faculty
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:51.120]   that no other creature has, which is abstract thought,
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.880]   the ability to look to the future
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:55.680]   and to imagine different possibilities.
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:59.200]   And you can do all of this from your own mind.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.700]   And in today's world, one major benefit that we have
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.840]   that past generations didn't have
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.920]   is you can, in a way, test drive things
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.160]   that you're interested in through being exposed
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.760]   to the experiences of others through good quality media.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.240]   A number of years ago, I took my family
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.800]   on a full-time RV trip.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.700]   We sold our house, we sold all our stuff,
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.680]   we got rid of all our stuff,
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:25.640]   and we moved into a 30-foot travel trailer.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.080]   I'm the wacky one in the family,
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.440]   and I was the one who had the idea.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.640]   My wife had never in her life sat down and thought,
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.720]   "Well, maybe I wanna go and live in a travel trailer."
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.440]   So what I did was I started talking to her about the idea,
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.080]   and then I started finding YouTube channels
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:39.200]   of people doing it.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.440]   And I started having her watch YouTube videos
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.000]   of people doing it.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   Over time, she started to realize,
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.640]   "You know, this isn't as crazy
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:48.160]   as it sounded at first glance.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.080]   This is possible, this is doable."
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.620]   And eventually, we came to the point where we said,
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:52.460]   "Yeah, let's do it."
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:53.760]   And we did it, and we had a great time,
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.800]   and I'm glad we did it.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.040]   We'll do it again.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.500]   I think we'll do it again.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:01.600]   Our experience, though, was informed
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.440]   by the example of other people actually doing it.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.520]   And the same thing occurs in life now.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.960]   We have access to people's stories,
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.760]   and we have access to people who transform themselves
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.760]   from broke to multi-billionaires,
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.560]   and we have access to people who are broke
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.440]   and who stay broke,
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:20.400]   but who live these really interesting lives,
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.960]   you know, living in a van in the desert for free.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.560]   And you can access all of them
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.280]   through the palm of your hand, which is just stunning.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.320]   And so what I encourage people to do
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.640]   is develop broad experience.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:33.880]   Expose yourself to what other people are doing,
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:38.200]   and then imagine life in the way that you want it to be,
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.400]   because we have the choice in today's world
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.000]   to choose the way that we want to live,
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.520]   and that's awesome.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.080]   And so you can think carefully about the paths
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:49.200]   that you might want to pursue.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.440]   You can think about where you might want to be,
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:53.360]   and in your head, as a human being,
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.920]   you can imagine, "If I do this,
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.120]   it will point me in that direction.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.160]   If I do this other thing,
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.800]   it'll point me in another direction."
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.860]   Socrates famously said,
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:02.940]   "An unexamined life is not worth living."
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:04.400]   I don't know if he was right,
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.420]   but if he was right,
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:09.480]   we have the ability to examine our lives more now
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:10.640]   than we ever did before.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.160]   And so as I'm growing older,
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.760]   I'm growing more confident in my willingness
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:18.280]   to take advantage of these opportunities we have,
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.240]   my willingness to try things,
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:22.560]   and I see the joy that has come to me from that,
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.320]   and I want to encourage other people to do that,
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.040]   to live consciously,
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.560]   to think, to dream,
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.640]   and to dream without limitation,
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:31.160]   and then work back to today
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.280]   to where you start to put together a plan
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.880]   that moves you in the direction of your dream.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.540]   - All right, I look forward to continuing
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:42.320]   to watch your journey from afar as we continue our own.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.200]   Joshua, is there anything else that we haven't covered today?
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.560]   We've had a big and far-ranging conversation
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.120]   that I've really enjoyed.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.680]   - I think the key thing I'd like to say
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.160]   is as a plug for the work that financial advisors do.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.800]   I'm no longer a licensed financial advisor.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.000]   I don't hold any insurance licenses,
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.760]   any investment licenses.
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:03.520]   I don't really even work with individuals anymore.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.600]   There's this tremendous challenge that people have
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.760]   when it comes to how to engage with a financial advisor,
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.480]   and obviously that's the work that you're doing now
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.640]   that you've transitioned into
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:16.480]   when you weren't previously a financial advisor.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.100]   What I want to point out, though,
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:22.800]   is that a good financial advisor, a good counselor,
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.800]   can cut years and years off of the learning curve
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.280]   that we all have with life.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.360]   And a good financial advisor who listens to you
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.960]   and who helps you to dream and who thinks about that
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:39.800]   and then applies that dreaming and that thinking
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.100]   to the money is an incredibly valuable resource.
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:47.580]   Is it possible to do by yourself?
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:51.860]   Yes, but it's a whole lot faster and more effective
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:53.760]   to work with somebody else.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:54.880]   And I've seen again and again
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.900]   when I was working as a financial advisor
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:59.200]   and I've seen again and again when working with people
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.960]   how an outside person doesn't have the same emotions
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.560]   that you have in the middle of your circumstances.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:06.880]   And the emotions get in our way.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.360]   They cause us not to see solutions.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.660]   And there've been so many times
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.080]   where I speak to somebody and I say,
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.100]   "Listen, if you just do this, you'll achieve your goals."
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.400]   And they look at me and say, "Why didn't I think of that?"
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.880]   So I just want to encourage you, Matt,
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.120]   and also to your listeners
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.040]   that the work that you do as a financial advisor
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.020]   is extraordinarily valuable.
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:28.860]   The financial advisor is and should be
[01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:32.180]   that link between accomplishing your goals
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:33.420]   and where you are today.
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:35.140]   Because any lifestyle goal,
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:37.380]   any dream that you have set out for yourself
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:40.940]   is going to include money in some capacity
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:43.020]   'cause money is how we fuel our lives.
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:46.060]   And so at its core, it's valuable to dream,
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:46.980]   it's valuable to think,
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:50.080]   it's valuable to imagine what life could be,
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.980]   but you've got to bring it back to today,
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:54.900]   to what you do today with your time and with your money.
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.820]   And that's where a good financial advisor
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:59.020]   is an incredibly valuable resource.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:00.300]   - I agree, and it's one of the things
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.140]   that keeps me getting up every morning
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.140]   and one of the reasons I love my work.
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.800]   So thanks for sharing that.
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.800]   Well, Joshua, how would you like people to follow up?
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.540]   Where should people look for you today?
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:14.260]   And what are the things that you are most focused
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.440]   on promoting from Radical Personal Finance
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.060]   and the work that you're doing there?
[01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.260]   - Best thing to do is if you're listening to this
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:20.500]   as a podcast, just go subscribe
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.480]   to Radical Personal Finance.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.140]   There's 750 episodes of life-changing content,
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:28.860]   if I do say so myself, of spectacular insights
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:33.220]   and riveting stories and incredibly entertaining delivery
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:34.060]   all by me.
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.220]   And so go to find, just find Radical Personal Finance
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:38.800]   wherever you like to listen to podcasts and check it out.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.780]   The library of titles is voluminous,
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:42.220]   but what I would say is just skip through
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.460]   and grab a couple of titles that sound interesting.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.620]   You may get hooked enough,
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:48.140]   as many of my listeners have reported to me,
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:51.620]   to just go back to episode one and listen your way through.
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:53.860]   In addition, I teach a number of courses,
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:56.340]   which can be found at radicalpersonalfinance.com
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:57.780]   on the store page there.
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.060]   In those courses, I have a course on credit cards
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:01.380]   called "How to Borrow Money Safely
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:03.260]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards,"
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:04.740]   which if you have a credit card
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:06.980]   or if you ever will have a credit card,
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.820]   I consider it a mandatory form of education.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.900]   I have a course called "How to Survive and Thrive
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.860]   During the Coming Economic Crisis,"
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:16.200]   which is all about how to put in place a plan
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.980]   that deals with the worst case scenario,
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:18.940]   but does it practically,
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:20.740]   and there are a number of other things there as well.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:22.540]   So if you're interested in any of those topics,
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:26.100]   you can find them at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.380]   - All right, terrific.
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.740]   Well, it has been my pleasure to have you on
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:30.840]   Life Meets Money today.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.980]   I really have looked forward to this conversation,
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:35.340]   and you have definitely delivered the gold.
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:38.820]   So thank you for your time and just for your friendship
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.580]   and support and encouragement
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:43.420]   as I've been on this journey for the last few years.
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:45.060]   Hope you have a great afternoon, Joshua.
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:46.540]   - Thank you for having me on, Matt.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:48.700]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:51.700]   - Well, here are the key takeaways from today's show.
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:53.740]   Whether you're Joshua Sheets or me,
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.860]   why publish online at all?
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.780]   Well, he and I are both looking to provide
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.860]   high quality web content that can help bridge the gap
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:04.980]   between personal finance and professional financial advice.
[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:07.700]   Next, Joshua took time to walk us through the stages
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:09.420]   of financial independence.
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:13.500]   First of all, stage zero, total financial dependence.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.460]   Moving on from there, hopefully quickly,
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:19.260]   into a stage one, financial solvency.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:21.420]   And in this stage, you're able to meet
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:23.780]   all of your current obligations.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:27.060]   Progressing from there to financial stability,
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:29.700]   where you are able to not only meet today's obligations,
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.460]   but anticipate how you're going to meet
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.780]   all of your obligations in the future.
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:36.620]   Then comes stage three, debt freedom.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:40.140]   In this stage, your future is no longer mortgaged
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:41.140]   by your past.
[01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:43.140]   Your decisions are much freer
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:44.940]   when you kick debt out of your life.
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:48.260]   Then stage four, financial security.
[01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:51.020]   In this stage, your investments are sufficient
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:54.140]   to provide for your minimum living needs.
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:56.540]   Then in stage five, financial independence,
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:47:58.060]   your investments are sufficient
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:00.780]   to provide your current lifestyle.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.100]   Stage six, financial freedom.
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:06.300]   Your investments generate enough income for you
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:08.940]   that not only can you provide your current lifestyle,
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:12.220]   you can also provide for an expanded lifestyle,
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:14.300]   baking some of those dreams in the cake.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.340]   And then finally, stage seven, financial abundance.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.660]   You have so much that you just can't even imagine
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.580]   what to do with it all.
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:24.940]   Your main problem is figuring out how to give it away.
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:28.860]   Insurance, which is a focus of Joshua and I's conversation,
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:32.620]   comes into your plan at the stage of financial stability.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.980]   This is an item that needs to be added
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:39.220]   to your financial planning sooner rather than later.
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:42.460]   Now, as Joshua and I go on, we talk about other ways
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:46.660]   that you can create financial abundance in your life.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.980]   And sort of ask the question,
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:49.580]   what's easier than retiring
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.820]   with millions and millions of dollars?
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.980]   Well, it turns out it's an awful lot easier
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:55.820]   to cultivate work you care about
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:58.020]   for reasons that are important to you
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:00.980]   and to develop a job or a business you love
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:03.540]   that provides an excellent lifestyle.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:06.740]   This is a much more achievable solution
[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.020]   than saving three to $6 million
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:10.260]   in order to stop working.
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:13.860]   In this episode, Joshua urges us to ask,
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.700]   what would life look like if we could never retire?
[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:19.660]   This is a recurring theme on his show.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.260]   And the answer to that question
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:25.020]   shows you what you are aiming for in your life.
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:26.500]   He also asked the question,
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:30.020]   what would you do if your rich uncle left you $5 million?
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:32.480]   And answering this may highlight areas
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:35.500]   where you'd like to make changes in your life today.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.540]   For example, here in North Carolina,
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:40.260]   a common answer from someone who inherited $5 million
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.740]   might be to buy a really nice beach house.
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:44.020]   And I always like to challenge people
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:45.420]   on this one a little bit.
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:47.540]   I'll ask them, how many weeks
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:49.540]   have you ever spent at the beach?
[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:51.260]   And they may say, well, there was one time
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:54.540]   we were able to spend two weeks at a stretch in the summer
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:56.220]   and we got to go back for Thanksgiving.
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:58.180]   So about two and a half weeks.
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:49:59.820]   And I say, well, how long do you think
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.180]   that you might like to spend?
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.020]   And they say, well, maybe we would like to spend
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:04.740]   two weeks a couple times
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:06.620]   and then maybe the whole week at Thanksgiving
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:07.900]   and a week at Christmas.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.260]   So about six weeks in a year.
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:12.500]   And I love to point out in that instance
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:17.020]   that you can rent six weeks in a year at a beach house
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:20.740]   for probably 25 to $30,000 at a super nice house
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:24.860]   that will hold you and all of your close family members
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:27.120]   and go try that for six weeks,
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.740]   which is more than double the amount of time
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:30.780]   that you've ever spent at the beach before.
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:34.300]   And for 25 to $30,000, you can test drive
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:37.460]   what you were thinking you would spend $2 million on.
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:40.260]   And the reason to point this out is just to say,
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.260]   many of the things that we think that we would do
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:45.740]   if we became independently wealthy
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:48.220]   are actually within our grasp today.
[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:51.340]   Going on from there, Joshua encourages us
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:54.180]   to define problems as those that can be solved with money
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.060]   versus those that need to be solved
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:57.700]   with something other than money.
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.940]   And our conversation takes in both kinds of problems.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.920]   Now, for problems that can be solved with money,
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:04.500]   keeping a big emergency fund
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.740]   and maybe a pile of credit cards is helpful.
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:09.820]   From there, I really agree with Joshua
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:12.540]   that disability income insurance is at the top of the heap
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:14.460]   in terms of what you need to own.
[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:16.740]   Yet, despite that fact, it's one of the least owned,
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:19.960]   least understood, least paid attention to types of insurance
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:22.580]   because people underestimate the value of their income
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:24.540]   and underrate how much better life is
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:27.220]   when they're properly insured for disability.
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:30.780]   As we wrap up our discussion of disability insurance,
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:33.380]   Joshua and I pivot to physical preparedness,
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:35.360]   which we both believe is underrepresented
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:37.500]   in the discipline of financial planning.
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.460]   So whether it's scatological jokes
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.140]   like toilet paper preparation
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:42.920]   or something much more serious,
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:45.400]   giving consideration to this aspect of your plan
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.240]   is part of providing for your family.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:49.980]   So what are the takeaways?
[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:53.280]   First, learn what you can from COVID in 2020.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:57.140]   Next, think about the primary, secondary
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:00.340]   and tertiary effects of disasters in your area.
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:03.220]   Here in the Southeast, for hurricane planning, for example,
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:06.060]   primary preparation means knowing where to shelter
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:07.860]   in my home during a bad storm.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:10.100]   Secondary preparation involves having batteries,
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.660]   gasoline, tools, and non-perishable food on hand
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.160]   to live through the cleanup.
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.820]   And tertiary planning involves knowing
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:17.860]   how I'll provide financially for my family
[01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:20.740]   due to a major disruption from the storm.
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:22.600]   Now, when it comes to podcasting,
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.660]   like Lin-Manuel Miranda in "Hamilton,"
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:27.500]   Joshua Sheets did not throw away his shot.
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.180]   Instead, he learned from his observation
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.580]   of successful people that when you see an opportunity,
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:33.020]   you've got to take it.
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.460]   Of course, this is no guarantee everything works out,
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:36.960]   but as Joshua and others note,
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:39.280]   you miss 100% of the shots you don't take,
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:42.340]   which Hamilton also discovered at the end of his life.
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:45.580]   Now, alongside taking the good shots, do some planning.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:47.900]   Take risks, but minimize the downside
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:49.780]   and avoid wipe-out risk.
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:51.660]   Joshua and I talked about independent media
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:54.660]   like this podcast and like "Radical Personal Finance."
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:57.860]   Joshua called independent media normal, not unusual,
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:00.980]   and I believe this is more true than ever in 2020.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:04.180]   Since in 2020, you're unlikely to win the internet,
[01:53:04.180 --> 01:53:05.620]   the kind of stuff you should be making
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:09.300]   is super high quality with a carefully curated niche.
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.440]   My niche is MBAs, entrepreneurs,
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:13.700]   and other high-income professionals who value planning
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:15.860]   and resonate with me personally.
[01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:17.180]   Leave me a review on iTunes
[01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:18.780]   if what I've been talking about
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.760]   seems to be working for you.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:23.460]   Lastly, Joshua discussed the role good advisors
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:24.680]   can have in your life,
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:27.740]   cutting years off the learning curve from almost any topic.
[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:29.780]   And I was touched to hear him call financial advisors
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.660]   the link between your dreams and where you are today.
[01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:35.420]   It's that purpose that keeps me going in this business.
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:39.800]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.420]   The last show in this risk management series
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:44.340]   on lifemeetsmoney.com is scheduled
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:47.200]   for Thursday, October 22nd, 2020.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:50.380]   I take Joshua and I's wide-ranging risk management discussion
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:52.620]   as a case study and apply these principles
[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:55.020]   within a hypothetical financial plan.
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:56.260]   I look forward to introducing you
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:59.340]   to my make-believe clients, Mike and Jennifer Murray.
