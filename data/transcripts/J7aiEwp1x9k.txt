[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - So I like to match looks from time to time in an homage.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   - You look sexy.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.600]   How many legs did you break in Eastern Europe?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.540]   - Three or four.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.240]   - To send a message or just for your own personal enjoyment?
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.240]   - If she wins, I'll personally give her a million dollars.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.920]   If I can footlock her, we're gonna collaborate together
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.900]   in an OnlyFans sex tape.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.720]   - Did she agree to this?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.200]   - She shook on it.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.720]   - You do have an OnlyFans channel.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.680]   Is that still up?
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.160]   - After August 17th, it's gonna be fire.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.080]   - It's gonna be on fire.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.800]   - Honestly, when we talk about Sugar Investor,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040]   I think that could fund the entire tournament.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.880]   - I missed all that.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.360]   What gives you hope?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.160]   - That you can still make fun of anything,
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.320]   as long as it's funny.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.760]   - The following is a conversation with Craig Jones,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.080]   martial artist, world traveler,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.840]   and one of the funniest people
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.880]   in the sport of submission grappling.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.960]   While he does make fun of himself a lot,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.640]   he is legitimately one of the greatest
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.680]   submission grapplers in the world.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   And underneath the veil of nonstop sexualized Aussie humor
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.040]   and incessant online trolling,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.160]   he is truly a kind-hearted human being
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.000]   who's trying to do good in the world.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.800]   Sometimes he does so through a bit of controversy and chaos,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.880]   like with the new CJI tournament
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.000]   that has over $2 million in prize money.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.840]   And it's coming up this Friday and Saturday.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.240]   Yes, the same weekend as the prestigious ADCC tournament.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.920]   The goal of CGI tournament is to grow the sport.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.060]   So you'll be able to watch it for free online,
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.460]   live on YouTube and other places.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.640]   All ticket profits go to charity,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.220]   mainly to cancer research.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.960]   So I encourage you to support the mission of this tournament
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.760]   by buying tickets and going to see the event in person.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.640]   Craig gave me a special link
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.180]   that gives you a 50% discount on the tickets.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.520]   Go to lexfriedman.com/cji
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.360]   and it should forward you to the right place.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.880]   They're trying to sell the last few tickets now.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.440]   It's a good cause, go buy some.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.880]   And also let me say, as a fan of the sport,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.040]   I highly encourage you to watch both CGI and ADCC
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.400]   and to celebrate athletes competing in both.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.600]   From CGI with Nicky Ryan, Nicky Rod,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.880]   Bertola Brothers, Fion Davis, McKenzie Dern, and more,
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.700]   to ADCC with Gordon Ryan, Nicholas Margali,
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.700]   Giancarlo Budoni, Rafael Lovato Jr, Mika Galvao, and more.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.160]   I have a lot of respect for everyone involved.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920]   I trained with many of them regularly
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.600]   and consider many of them friends,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.760]   including Craig, Gordon, and of course, John Donaher,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.120]   who I will talk to many, many more times on this podcast.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.160]   This is "Alex Friedman Podcast."
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.960]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.200]   in the description.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.560]   And now, dear friends, I invite you all to come to the pool
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.640]   with Craig Jones and me.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.120]   When you brought the $1 million in cash
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.440]   on Rogan's podcast, did you have security with you?
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.000]   - We had security, but only by Joe Rogan's request,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.720]   'cause he said, "You're really gonna bring it?"
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.160]   - Yeah. - "Do you have security?"
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.000]   I said, "No."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.820]   He's like, "Don't worry about it.
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.240]   "I'll send my security."
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.920]   - So you were gonna deal with our security?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.760]   - Yeah, we're gonna win.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.520]   I thought, I mean, I was told not to tell anyone,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.680]   but I sent pictures of it to everyone I know,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.320]   so that was probably a security risk.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.560]   - Yeah, so it's just you and a car with a bag of cash.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.480]   - Yeah, it was a company that sponsors me, Shuffle.com.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   It was their friend, a friend of theirs,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080]   so a guy that's never met me before
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.480]   just took the risk to show up to a stranger's house
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.800]   with $1 million in cash to bring to Joe Rogan.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.640]   It was a big risk of him.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.720]   And he just put it in the car and drove it.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.840]   - Drove it over there, yeah.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.880]   - Yeah, well, no security except Joe.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.360]   - Except Joe. - That's common sense.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.760]   - And then Joe said he'd never seen $1 million before.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.600]   - Yeah.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   - But I don't know if I believe him.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.960]   - That's what everyone says.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.400]   That's what Pablo Escobar probably says also.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.880]   What's your relationship with risk,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.760]   especially with the risk of death?
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.780]   - I would say I'm very risk-averse.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.620]   - You are.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.440]   No, you're not.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.280]   That's a lie.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.600]   - My relationship with risk, I like a bit of excitement.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.000]   I like a bit of adventure.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I'm more about the adventure,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.680]   but I will not let the risk get in the way of it.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.800]   And also, obviously just got back from Ukraine.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.280]   I'm happy to take a few risks
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.400]   if it's part of what the locals want me to do.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.920]   Like in Kazakhstan, we did some things that were dangerous.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.680]   Like if the locals are like, come along,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.280]   join in on this activity,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.680]   I feel personally obligated to go with them.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.640]   - So it's not about the risk.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.000]   Like you're not attracted to risk,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.080]   you're attracted to adventure.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.520]   And the risk is the thing you don't give a damn about
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.600]   if it comes along with it.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.960]   - Sometimes the best adventures
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.000]   involve the most risk, unfortunately.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.440]   - Speaking of which, you went to Ukraine,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.760]   like you said, twice recently.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.880]   - Twice, really pushed the limit there.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.560]   - Including to the front.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.480]   - To the front.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.880]   - Tell me the full story of that from the beginning.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.320]   How did you end up in Ukraine?
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.400]   - So we're in Kazakhstan.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.040]   We're doing some filming in Kazakhstan.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.960]   And obviously Borat's still a very traumatic memory for them.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.480]   And some of my jokes felt like they don't go as well
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.000]   in that neck of the woods.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.360]   So we had some difficulty filming out there.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.800]   So we filmed this horse game.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.080]   Have you ever heard of cock bar?
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.000]   - Thanks to you, yes.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.080]   - It's a game, a very, very old game.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.320]   They cut a goat or a sheep.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.760]   I didn't get too close to look at it,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.000]   but they cut its head and legs off
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.480]   and they use it as some form of bull.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.880]   And then they'll have like up to a thousand guys on horses
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.840]   violently trying to pick this up
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.480]   and drop it in the other end's goals, basically.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.600]   The goals used to be concrete.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.800]   Now it's just a tarp,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.000]   but local business owners will throw down
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.440]   huge amounts of money for the winners.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.960]   And these horses have been trained from a very young age.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.880]   The riders have been trained.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.800]   I've never ridden a horse before.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.760]   We wanted to film something that made it look like
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.920]   I was gonna go into the horse pit, into the cock bar pit.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.880]   However, the drunk stunt man that we used
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.360]   just decided that when he took my horse reins,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.160]   he would take me straight into the pit
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.960]   instead of ending the shot there.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.120]   So I was in there amongst, I guess the horse riders,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.680]   the cock bar riders, and we weren't leaving.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.720]   We just were in there for quite a while.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.200]   And he was just, he could talk a little bit,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.160]   he could talk English pretty well, actually.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000]   And he's like,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.200]   "Oh, I thought you'd want to check it out from the inside."
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.720]   And then while we're in there,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.880]   someone picked up the sort of carcass
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.960]   and a wave of horse riders came at me.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.600]   I was quite concerned at that point
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.960]   'cause they're bashing into each other.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.800]   And obviously they're angry.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.760]   They're seeing a foreigner in there.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   I was wearing like basically biggie, smalls,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.880]   coogee, gecko-looking sweater.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.000]   So I stood out.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.960]   They definitely didn't like that I was participating
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.280]   in a game that they probably trained their whole life for.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.760]   And that amount of money they could win
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.000]   is very, very significant.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.640]   And there's me in there.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.840]   They're also pointing out Borat, Borat,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.000]   thinking I was making Borat jokes,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.680]   which again, very traumatic memory
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.720]   for the people at Kazakhstan.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.400]   - Were you making Borat jokes?
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.360]   - No, but I guess it's the same type of humor.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.160]   But just, I guess, I'm not pretending to be Kazakh.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.200]   I'm just there being an idiot
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.480]   and enjoying the local culture.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.560]   But we're over there in Kazakhstan.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.400]   We did that.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.320]   That was obviously a bit risky.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.720]   - Did they learn to love you?
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.480]   - I think they learned to love me
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.560]   and then to hate me again.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.400]   So it was like a bit of a all-encompassing relationship
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.280]   for the Kazakh people.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.440]   But we basically abandoned ship.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.720]   It was proven too difficult to film some things,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.920]   some sensitive subjects over there.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.040]   And I said, "Where should we go next?"
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.880]   And I just looked at the map
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.760]   and I was like, "We're near Ukraine."
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.720]   Ukraine was a place that I'd been offered
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.360]   to teach a jiu-jitsu seminar prior to,
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.400]   I guess, the war commencing,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.120]   the full-scale war commencing.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.800]   And we're looking for a bit of adventure,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.920]   something interesting to film,
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.800]   something following the news,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.160]   obviously very controversial in the news.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.440]   People have very strong opinions.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.120]   And I was like, "Let's go over there.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.240]   "Let's throw a charity event.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.080]   "Let's do something.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.160]   "Let's train with the people
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.240]   "and really experience for ourselves."
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.720]   So we set up the seminar.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.400]   Turned out to be the biggest seminar
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.200]   for jiu-jitsu in Ukraine history,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.120]   which is wild considering,
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.480]   obviously they are at war,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.320]   but everyone came together to support it.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.520]   And one of the soldiers there,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   one of my friends there,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.120]   good friend now who's on the frontline,
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.760]   he made a comment on there.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.280]   And he said, "Hey, this is a seminar
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.800]   "to donate profits to the soldiers,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.880]   "but we're on the frontline."
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.280]   And I was like, "You know what?
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.000]   "I'll come to you."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.560]   And he's like, "Listen, I can't promise you'll survive,
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.800]   "but I'll promise you'll have a good time."
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.280]   And I said, "That's all I needed to hear."
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.360]   So we connected and my friend Roman,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.840]   we went really, really close.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   I think we were at the closest point,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.200]   seven kilometers from the frontline.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   Obviously very surreal experience to be over there,
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.160]   seeing basically how the battles fought with all drones.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.400]   - How long ago was this?
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.080]   - I think it would have been March or April.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.920]   So we went there.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.760]   We went basically spent two nights up on the frontline,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.800]   went back to Kiev, and that was it for that trip.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.640]   In terms of crazy stuff that happens,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.720]   obviously just the people living,
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.160]   like you download the air defense tracker.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.920]   So at any time there could be an air siren going off,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.520]   an air alert on your phone,
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.680]   could be like drones heading your way,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.560]   planes are in the air, missiles flying,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.600]   and then those missiles will change direction and stuff.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.560]   So the air alert, you don't know
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.880]   if it's heading a different direction,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.080]   but they just sort of warn everyone.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.040]   So you live under a constant state of fear, basically.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.640]   And then on that first trip,
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.960]   the heaviest moment was I was going downstairs
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.760]   in the hotel to work out,
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.680]   which is honestly a rare thing these days,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.640]   doing something healthy with myself.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.680]   - You working out.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.120]   - Getting in the gym, pumping some iron.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.520]   And this was divine intervention
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   that a hypersonic missile was shot down
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.320]   by the Patriot defense system,
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.360]   just like five minutes from the hotel.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.440]   So the whole hotel and the attached gym
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.320]   just shook like crazy.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.000]   And some people started freaking out.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.760]   Most people went to leave to go outside,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.200]   which I don't think is recommended,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.280]   but you want to see what's going on out there.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.240]   - This was in Kyiv.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.320]   - This was in Kyiv.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.560]   So it got shot down.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.360]   And then some of the local troops
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.400]   actually took me to the site
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.480]   of where just part of the missile had landed in the ground
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.040]   and left this huge sort of indentation.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.000]   They'd already cleared up most of the,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.320]   I guess, shrapnel from the missile.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.200]   I don't know if I should,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.400]   or if I was legally allowed to do this,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.520]   but I took some of that missile back home with me.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.120]   I don't know where I left it, actually.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.000]   But I thought maybe that would raise some alarm bells
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.880]   and airport scans, but I took it regardless.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.960]   And that was basically the craziest thing
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.080]   that happened on that first trip.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.920]   - The Patriot defense system is incredible.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.640]   It's an incredible piece of technology.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.760]   That's from the United States.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.280]   It's expensive, but it's incredible.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.400]   And so that's protecting Kyiv.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.040]   - That's protecting Kyiv, yeah.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.080]   That was at the time where U.S. hadn't voted to,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.240]   I guess, keep funding the weapons over there.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.120]   So it was kind of a tense moment 'cause I think,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.800]   I don't know, everyone was thinking like,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.360]   when do those air defense missiles run out?
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.640]   So that was a heavy moment for me thinking,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.160]   look at what it shot out the sky.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.480]   Like, imagine if that didn't, if they didn't have that.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.160]   But we, yeah, that was probably the most surreal moment.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.480]   But Kyiv largely, life goes on most of the time
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.880]   as per normal.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   I was faced with crazy messages and comments,
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.600]   even just posting that video.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.040]   Like, I'm getting paid by Ukraine and stuff.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.840]   And it's just like, people just don't understand
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.160]   that life has to go on.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.480]   Like, Kyiv's here.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.440]   The front line's far away.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   Like, the cities have to largely try to operate as normal
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.200]   or just life will not go on in those villages and cities.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.480]   - Well, it's human nature as well.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.320]   It's not just Kyiv.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.120]   It's Kharkiv, it's even Donbass, Kherson.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.280]   People get accustomed to war quickly.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.960]   As it's impossible to suffer for prolonged periods of time.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.840]   So you adjust and you appreciate the things you still have.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.080]   - Yeah, it's some baller moves out there.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.200]   I love seeing people that just crazy stuff's going on
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.320]   from the war and they don't even react to it.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.960]   They don't go to the bomb shelter.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.040]   It's like a baller move.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.520]   Like, I'm not gonna change my lifestyle.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.720]   Actually on that first trip as well,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.200]   something else that I probably shouldn't have been allowed
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.600]   to do was go to Chernobyl.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.000]   So Chernobyl, I believe troops came through Belarus
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.600]   and there was some fighting going on in Chernobyl.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   I think the whole world got concerned at that point
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.160]   if any sort of radiation leaked.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.840]   But Chernobyl as it stands, the troops back down
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.160]   and it's completely covered in mines.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.640]   Very, very difficult to go to Chernobyl.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.400]   Basically as a tourist or as like, I guess,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.760]   an idiot like myself should really probably not be allowed
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.160]   in a place like that.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.320]   But we were able to get there.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.160]   We passed like four security checkpoints.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.800]   It took two attempts.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.280]   First time we tried to go in there
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.560]   was with a special forces guy.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.920]   We cleared two security gates.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.840]   Then they stopped us and basically threatened us
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.680]   with arrest, rightfully so.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.280]   Really have no business going to Chernobyl.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.120]   We made a connection.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.600]   I won't say who this connection was,
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.880]   but he had heard about what I had done
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.480]   sort of with a charity event and opened some doors
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.160]   for us to be able to go to Chernobyl.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.760]   So we got to see Chernobyl.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.200]   We had some filming restrictions there
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.600]   just because it was a crazy military sort of conflict
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.040]   at one point and we got to actually see Chernobyl.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.800]   Chernobyl's always been a dream of mine to see
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   'cause it's just such an interesting place.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.840]   And to see it under these conditions, very, very strange.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.920]   - Yeah, what was that like?
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.400]   So there's no civilians there now.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.960]   - It's just completely empty.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.080]   I guess it's kind of like the fantasy you have.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.080]   I imagine people going tours of Chernobyl
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.520]   back in the tourist days when it was a tourist spot
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.400]   and it would be busy, full of tourists.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.720]   We got basically a private tour,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.880]   so we got to really feel that abandoned sort of vibes.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.280]   I guess I was interested in it from playing Call of Duty
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.120]   and then Chernobyl series, all the documentaries and stuff,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.160]   but very, very strange place to go visit.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.800]   - And it is now a minefield like a lot of parts of Ukraine.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   That's one of the dark, terrifying aspects of wars,
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.680]   how many mines are left.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.480]   Even when the war ends, for decades after,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.560]   there's mines everywhere
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.200]   'cause demining is extremely difficult.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   And that could continually kill people.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.800]   - I don't think it'll be a tourist spot for a very long time
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.720]   because if you were thinking about areas to demine
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.200]   when the conflict ends,
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.400]   an area where if you accidentally trigger a mine
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.960]   could cause a radiation leak,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.440]   it's probably gonna be very low on the list.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.240]   So tourism for Chernobyl,
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.800]   who knows how long until that returns?
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.400]   - Why do you think you were able to get to Chernobyl?
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   Is there, why don't you think the Ukrainian people,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.440]   the Ukrainian soldiers don't see you as a threat?
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.520]   - Maybe they were hoping I did step on a mine.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.560]   Maybe my jokes didn't go too well there.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.920]   - So your connection was actually Putin.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.120]   He was trying to get rid of you.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.960]   - Putin, yeah.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.000]   Now, I don't know.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.680]   I mean, we felt pretty safe when we were there.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.400]   There was an air alert went off.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.800]   They were kind of more concerned with me dying
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.360]   just for the PR side of things.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.680]   It's like Australian tourists.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.760]   - In one of your videos,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.120]   I actually heard the Ukrainian language
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120]   they were talking about.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.360]   We don't wanna lose an athlete.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.200]   That's what they're saying,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.440]   as you're loading the rocket launcher.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.480]   - Oh yeah, the rocket launcher.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   I shot a rocket launcher with the troops on the first trip,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.920]   but the second trip I went back to,
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.640]   which was only maybe four to five weeks ago.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.480]   This time we went to some crazier spots.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.360]   So we went to Odessa, which has been hit a ton.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.320]   - I really enjoyed the video of old man stretching
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.200]   and exercising on the Odessa shore.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.040]   - Yeah, what is that?
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.080]   Is that a local custom?
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.240]   - Well, Odessa people are known historically to be wild.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.400]   - That was wild.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.480]   It was abrasive to the eyes, but I appreciated it,
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.400]   especially a middle-aged man in underwear
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.200]   with a beer belly doing a sun dance at dusk.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.000]   That would frighten many people.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.080]   The battleship would turn around.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.480]   Yeah, so where else?
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.800]   - Yeah, so we went to Odessa.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.360]   We briefly went back to Kyiv.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.920]   So I made a connection with the police chief
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.440]   of basically the entire country last time.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.640]   And he had said to me that if I wanted to go somewhere
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.960]   sort of really heavy in terms of action,
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.280]   we could go to Kurson.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.160]   And he's like, "I'll personally escort you to Kurson."
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.640]   And I was just like, well,
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.040]   here we have an invitation for adventure.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.080]   I think it's a great idea to go.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.280]   And I thought, you know what?
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.160]   I'll completely lie to my cameraman
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.640]   and tell him it's a safe trip to go on
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.560]   so that he can pass that information onto his fiancee
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.080]   and she won't have any concerns.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.120]   So we basically take this huge journey
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.040]   all the way down to Kurson.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.400]   We switch at a city outside.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.240]   I can't remember the name,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.480]   but we had to switch to sort of armored vehicles.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.320]   And I remember the guy that picked us up there said,
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.040]   "Hey, give me a phone number for someone to call
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.000]   "to recover your bodies."
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.920]   And he said that in a joking way,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.760]   but I think he was serious.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.800]   But I said, "Just leave it."
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.120]   I'm not, I don't think they need.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.040]   I don't think we have much left
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.920]   probably if we get hit over there.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.600]   But we go basically into Kurson.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.640]   I think Kurson's population used to be like 250,000.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   Now it's like basically all military down to 50,000.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.760]   So we went into the police,
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.880]   basically stationed in the bunker underneath.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.840]   The top of the building was destroyed.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.440]   And then one of the local guys just took us on a city tour,
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.200]   which again, we had some filming restrictions
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.520]   'cause obviously anytime something's hit,
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.600]   I guess the other side wants to be able to see
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.920]   what damage has been done.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   So if you take any footage of recently destroyed buildings,
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.160]   that's gonna help them recalibrate
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.680]   and target the next shot.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.440]   So Kurson being so heavily hit,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.640]   it's basically within range
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.240]   of every single thing Russia has,
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.360]   every form of weapon, drones.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.680]   Before we took the tour,
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.560]   he put some drone blocking things on top of the car,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.600]   which didn't look reassuring.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.480]   He also took a helmet out the back of the car,
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.320]   which I thought he was gonna give to me,
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.000]   but he just threw it in the back of the pickup truck
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.560]   and said, "Oh, you won't need this.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.880]   You'll be dead anyway."
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   And I was like, "Oh, I've made a great life decision
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.400]   with this little Kurson tour."
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.360]   But then we took a tour of the city
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.480]   and Kurson used to be kind of like a beautiful beach city
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.960]   by the Dnieper River.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.320]   But basically it's just the river that separates Russia
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   from, I guess, the Russian land they've taken from Kurson.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.840]   So Kurson split across that river
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.000]   and there's just Russians on the other side of the river
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.160]   and Ukrainians on this side.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.600]   So very, very dangerous spot.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.160]   Kharkiv makes a lot of press
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.280]   because of the long range missiles that hit,
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.240]   but Kurson's just being hit all the time.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.680]   So we took this tour, we went along the river,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.640]   we went to within one kilometer of the frontline.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.920]   So that was the closest we got.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.320]   After this point, we heard artillery strike.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.360]   And because you're in an armored vehicle,
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.120]   it sounds further away than it is.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.160]   Obviously the sound doesn't get in.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.560]   So I thought it sounded far away.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.920]   We could see some smoke
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.400]   that actually appeared close in the distance.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.760]   The guy driving us took us to a point
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.320]   where a large building was blocking us
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.000]   from, I guess, the angle at which
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.760]   the missile would have came from.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.880]   And I thought everything was cool.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.160]   Thought it must've been off in the distance.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   And then we heard two more strikes hit very, very close.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.880]   They sounded really loud.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.160]   And then I think he's radioing to see if everything's safe,
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.760]   if we can leave this point.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.120]   And then we basically raced back.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.360]   But I started to realize we were in danger
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.680]   at any point where he really sped the car up
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.200]   or took evasive movements in the car.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.040]   But we got out of there
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.680]   and I think I had someone translate it later.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.760]   And basically, yeah, he was checking to see
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.800]   if the roads were clear for us to leave.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.520]   Ultimately, it ended up being someone died
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.760]   and a few people were injured from that blast,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.920]   which was less than half a kilometer from us.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.080]   And basically, they were radioing saying end the tour,
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.680]   come back to the police station.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.400]   - Artillery is terrifying 'cause there's just shelling
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.440]   and it's the destructive power of artillery is insane.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.920]   - Yeah, and it's constant all the time.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.240]   Yeah, and you hear that noise and you're like,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.920]   is that coming or going?
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.640]   Very, very concerning.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.920]   - Right, you don't know.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.880]   - Yeah, I'm like-- - You don't know.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.360]   And just like that, it could be you and you're gone.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   Last time the village we went to,
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.280]   basically, it was the day we left.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.960]   So we stayed there overnight.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.280]   The day we left, it just started getting extremely shelled.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.680]   And the soldier we were with just took a selfie video of us
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.600]   and basically in the location we were in,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.760]   just hearing just artillery strike after artillery strike,
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.680]   just being like, oh, you guys left and the fun began.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.880]   So they take it in good spirit.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.760]   I was trying to use their energy to reassure myself,
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.720]   but I guess when they see it every day,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.000]   they're kind of more adjusted to it.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.760]   They're not freaking out every time
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.600]   something crazy like that goes on.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.480]   - Well, they have to, right?
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.760]   They have to be in good spirit.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.520]   You have to be joking and laughing and--
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.640]   - Yeah, the guys are always laughing and joking.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.320]   They were laughing and joking at me quite a bit,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.200]   holding weapons, trying to shoot weapons and stuff.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.280]   They got a lot of enjoyment out of me shooting the RPG.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.680]   - Yeah, they're probably still telling stories
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.160]   of that crazy Australian-American that rolled in.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.280]   - They helped me out though
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.720]   in my marketing campaign for the tournament.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   We were able to secure a Lada, classic Soviet Union car.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.000]   We towed it, we painted it with the logos
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.280]   of the other event, the ADCC,
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.200]   and we got to shoot some RPGs at it.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.040]   - Yeah.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.960]   - Great experience, great fun.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.680]   - Yeah, it's a very creative marketing campaign.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.800]   - Very dangerous one.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.160]   - I don't think like Coke or Pepsi are gonna do that one.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.560]   So it's very, very innovative.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.400]   - It was a bold move.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.480]   Luckily, they let me get away with posting it.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.960]   But when we were there, it was basically at a shooting range
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.000]   and we cleared them out for a while.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.040]   So we'd blown up the car, we'd set it on fire.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.360]   We'd done all this sort of stuff.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.040]   I remember we were trying to blow it up.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.920]   It wasn't quite hitting.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.640]   One of the missiles was lodged in under the car.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.480]   So it was kind of risky.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.160]   That could have gone off at any moment,
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.840]   but we needed to get it to ignite.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.520]   We needed to get a shot where it was on fire.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.320]   The logo of the enemy tournament was basically on fire.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.440]   So we poured gasoline on it.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.320]   We shot the gasoline tank.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.160]   That didn't work.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.360]   That must be a movie trick or something.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.680]   And then we decided we'd light on fire a rag
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.520]   and just throw it into the blown out back window.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.000]   So I'm with this guy, special forces guy,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.560]   and we throw the rag in the back.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.360]   - Like soaked in gasoline rag?
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.720]   - Yeah, and we start running and he's like, "Stop, stop."
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.680]   He's like, "It didn't go off."
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.880]   So we're sitting there quite close to the car,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.000]   lighting it, trying to light more
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.560]   as we walk back to the car.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.160]   And then we just hear the car ignite.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.800]   And he's like, "Run, run, run."
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.440]   So we came quite close to death already at that point.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.640]   But we wanted to get the shot,
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.080]   some photos in front of the burning logos.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.840]   But we told the guys at the shooting range
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.440]   to basically give us 10 minutes or so,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.200]   so we could take the photos.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.840]   I don't know if they didn't wait the full 10 minutes
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.720]   or if we took too long,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.680]   but they started firing at the targets anyway.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.600]   And then the ricochets were flying
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.320]   very, very close to us over our head.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.240]   One landed right by my leg.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.720]   We're like, "Shit, we better get out of here."
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   Obviously not much safety concerns at that point,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.400]   but we survived basically artillery strikes.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.160]   We survived a bit of friendly fire
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.000]   with the bullets coming our way.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.280]   But again, I was strangely calm
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.440]   because the other guys were calm.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.520]   But then afterwards, they said to me,
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.960]   they were like, "Oh, bro, if you got shot,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.640]   "we'd just have to dump your body at a hospital.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.560]   "We wouldn't be able to explain
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.280]   "why you're here blowing up cars."
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.800]   - Right, right.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.240]   And you're American and athlete, international celebrity.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.920]   - They'd be like, "What is he doing on the front line?"
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.080]   There's no real good explanation for it.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   But I mean, even through the jokes and stuff,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.720]   it's good to highlight
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.800]   what's actually happening over there.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.360]   It's obviously very, very bad.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.640]   - What's the morale of the soldiers like?
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.080]   Is there still an optimism?
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.520]   Is there still a hope?
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.160]   - I mean, there's sort of the battle fatigue.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.000]   And as they say, all the heroes die early.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.360]   The guys that the real heroes
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.920]   that are willing to sacrifice themselves,
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   they're the ones that are gonna get taken out quick.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.000]   Unfortunately, that's the reality from over there.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.680]   But their thoughts are mostly
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.440]   that it's gonna be a prolonged war.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.160]   Like when I ask them about how fast the front line moves,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.440]   they're like, "Oh, it could take six months
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.680]   "to move one 200 meters."
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.280]   So it just feels like it's gonna go on forever.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.120]   And from the Ukrainian side's perspective,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.200]   those guys talk to me about how
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.240]   when they hear radio intercepts of Russian soldiers
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.920]   marching to the same front line spot
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.680]   is that basically they're marching
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.280]   into certain death at certain locations.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.760]   And based on the radio transmissions,
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.680]   they know they're gonna die,
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.560]   but they head forth anyway,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.520]   straight forward into a Ukrainian position,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.560]   which is just wild to me.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.400]   I guess World War II,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.120]   they just keep throwing troops at it.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.200]   And you see a ton of footage they take themselves,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.160]   which is just mind blowing.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.000]   Obviously some of this footage
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.760]   doesn't make it to the internet
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.920]   'cause it's got important details in those conflicts,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.040]   but they're showing first-person perspectives
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.840]   of trench warfare.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.560]   It's just crazy to see
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.720]   what some of these guys have gone through.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.840]   - So I went to a lot of the same places as well,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.880]   including Kherson.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.640]   What was your sense of the place?
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.600]   - Kherson was like, it was just so destroyed.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.840]   I think at this point,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.440]   most of the civilians are gone.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.400]   I saw a lot of just elderly people left behind,
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.080]   especially a lot of old men.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.240]   And I just think they're just like,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.800]   "Hey, I've lived here my whole life.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.480]   I'm just never leaving."
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.760]   So no matter the level of danger,
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.560]   those guys just remain.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.920]   And then it's largely just,
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.280]   I guess, military in Kherson.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.800]   But that place felt very, very dangerous.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   I didn't realize until we got there
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.200]   just quite how destroyed it is.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.400]   - How did that experience change you?
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.160]   Just seeing war head on?
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:18.920]   - How did it change me?
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.080]   I guess just realizing a lot of these soldiers
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.960]   are just like, you kind of distance yourself from them,
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.880]   thinking that they're something separate.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.760]   But really speaking to a lot of the Ukrainian soldiers,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.360]   like my friend Roman,
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.600]   he hadn't lived in Ukraine for eight years.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   He lived in France.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.440]   He got a life.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.280]   He's got a wife over there.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.360]   He's got a daughter.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.560]   He basically volunteered to come back
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.360]   to protect his mom and brother who still lived there.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.160]   So it's like, you sort of,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   I used to view them military guys,
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.480]   'cause in Australia, and I guess in the US,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.360]   they don't have this conscription ongoing right now.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.960]   Whereas obviously there's guys like Roman who volunteered,
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.320]   but then there's a lot of Ukrainian soldiers
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.000]   that were conscripted into the war.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.760]   So it's like, you just realize how
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.000]   a lot of these guys are everyday people.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.720]   They're just in this crazy situation
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.080]   where Roman felt obligated to return to Ukraine,
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.760]   like from my perspective,
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.920]   anyone from Australia or US,
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.160]   it's just a different perspective on those.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.800]   They feel different to the regular people
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.240]   fighting in Ukraine from my perspective.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.200]   - Yeah, it's defending the land that is your home.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.360]   - Yeah, like Japan was coming for Australia,
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.520]   I guess in World War II, they attacked the North,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.480]   but really there was no foot battle,
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.680]   and there was no soldiers on the ground within Australia.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.320]   I guess US too during World War II.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.400]   So it's like a completely different perspective
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.880]   from our recent histories compared to,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   like if you were Ukrainian,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.680]   and there's Russians within the defined border,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.800]   their responsibility to protect their homeland
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.280]   and their family is just something you can't imagine,
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.720]   but also after having spent time with them,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.240]   you can see why they feel such a strong sense of obligation
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.800]   to protect Ukraine, protect their family and friends.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.240]   - And in a lot of cases,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.200]   the soldiers are using their own funds to buy equipment,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.880]   whether it's bullets, whether it's guns,
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.440]   whether it's armor, is that still what you saw?
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.280]   - Yeah, I mean, in terms of the weapons,
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.640]   America provides weapons.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.960]   So we saw a wide selection of weapons.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.840]   Some of those would be old Soviet weapons,
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.040]   like obviously the RPG we shot,
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.480]   and what we shot out of it is all Soviet.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.680]   It's very old weaponry.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.480]   And then you've got US weapons that have been given as well.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.040]   But in terms of the basic soldiers' equipment,
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.080]   like if they want good quality stuff
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.400]   that might be the difference between them
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.840]   surviving the winter or the summer,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.960]   just in the extreme temperature range,
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.320]   like they have to pay for that all themselves.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.920]   So they always joke about when foreign soldiers
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.640]   come over to train them,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.280]   or a lot of foreign soldiers come to learn
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.280]   about sort of the drone technology they've developed
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.360]   on a budget, is they always joke with them
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.480]   about how like everything from most countries
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.720]   is basically supplied.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.880]   All the good quality standard equipment they'd need
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.240]   is just supplied by the government.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.640]   But in Ukraine, obviously funding is very stretched.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.240]   So these guys to have the best equipment,
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.800]   they have to basically find money to pay for it themselves.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.880]   And they'll do that by seeking donations.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.400]   Best way to get donations would be
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   to grow social media profiles.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.800]   So that's when you see a lot of
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.400]   sort of social media warfare
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.480]   from a perspective of gaining fame
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.000]   to secure donations for their battalion,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.600]   to be able to fight better or protect themselves.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.000]   And also some of the social media warfare,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.640]   I guess is psychological warfare against the enemy.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.360]   You'll see like private telegram groups
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.680]   where they're showing what they've done to the enemy,
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.320]   what the enemy's done to them.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.760]   It's just crazy.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.280]   - Yeah, there's telegram groups on both sides.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.600]   And it's basically, some of it is propaganda.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.920]   Some of it is psychological warfare.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.240]   Some of it is just the human nature of being like,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.680]   of increasing your own morale
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.280]   and the morale of the people around you
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.360]   by showing off successfully killing other human beings,
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.160]   which are made other in war.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.640]   And the nature of this war has evolved.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.960]   So drones have become more and more prevalent.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.160]   They're consumer level cheap drones.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.040]   Can you speak to that?
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.080]   Have you seen the use of FPV drones?
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.320]   - Yeah, so I mean, basically like a $300 to $500 drone.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.120]   I think it's like carbon fiber, 3D printed,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   and they can attach different forms of weaponry to it,
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.080]   whether it's just dropping a frag,
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.680]   they could drop a mine out of it.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.440]   I know they were talking about how they had a liquid
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.480]   that could basically burn through
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.280]   sort of a lot of cars and tanks.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.640]   So the person inside would basically melt alive,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.760]   which sounds horrible.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.240]   But what's mind blowing to me
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.160]   is you could have like a $3 million Russian tank
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.080]   that could be destroyed by a $300 drone,
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.920]   which is just crazy how fast the war changes.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.080]   I think they're kind of the world leaders
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   in budget drone technology.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.480]   They obviously don't have the budget
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.080]   for these crazy elaborate massive drones.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.640]   I did see some higher budget, bigger drones over there,
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.480]   but for the most part,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.040]   those FPV drones is really how most of the battles are fought
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.680]   and you're seeing the cameras on them.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   So you can see like basically kamikaze drone
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.880]   will chase someone down and they have that footage.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.760]   And that's what the police chief said to me
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.920]   when he gifted me one of the drones they used.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.160]   And he basically said, he's like, artillery is scary,
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.760]   but a drone will follow you into a building.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.680]   It's like kind of a haunting thing to think about.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.920]   Like they'll see the drone, they'll hear the drone.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.520]   They might try to shoot it down or they might try to run.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.560]   But if it's a kamikaze one,
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.320]   those guys are pretty good at flying them.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.040]   It's gonna chase the soldiers down.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.800]   A lot of soldiers like pretending to be dead.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.120]   It's really crazy.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.600]   Some of the footage out there with those FPV drones.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.760]   - So it's a terrifying tool of war
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.960]   and tool of psychological war
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.980]   and used by both sides increasingly.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.720]   - Yeah, both sides use it.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.120]   I remember I was with Roman in Marseilles
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.800]   and he had his break period.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.960]   He was allowed to leave the country
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.000]   'cause he basically volunteered to join the army.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.160]   Ukrainian men can't really leave Ukraine right now.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.680]   But Roman, I was in Marseilles
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.960]   and this was a surreal experience for him.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.320]   We went to the beach and there was some tourists there
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.440]   flying a drone and you just saw his instinctual reaction
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.200]   to that drone sounds in the sky.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.120]   Flashback to that.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.040]   - Currently they're all, as far as I know,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.640]   all human controlled, so FPV.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.440]   But to me, increasingly terrifying notion
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.760]   is of them becoming autonomous.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.680]   It's the best way to defend against the drone
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.420]   that's FPV controlled is for AI to be controlling that drone.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.560]   Just have swarms of drones that are $500 controlled
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.400]   by AI systems.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.560]   And that's a terrifying possibility
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.560]   that the future of warfare is essentially swarms of drones
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.840]   on both sides.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.160]   And then maybe swarms of drones,
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.000]   say between US and China over Taiwan.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:18.840]   - That would be wild.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   I mean, they do those crazy drone light shows
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.640]   where they do those performances with the lights and stuff.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.520]   So they're already pretty sophisticated
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.840]   with sort of pre-programming.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.000]   - Those are pre-programmed.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.560]   So the low level control, flight control of those
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.120]   is done autonomously, but there's a interface
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.400]   for doing the choreography that's hard-coded in.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.480]   But adding increasing levels of intelligence to a drone
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.360]   where you can detect another drone,
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.460]   follow it and defend yourself.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.880]   - In terms of the military on both sides of the Ukraine war,
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.320]   that's a technology,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.600]   that's like the most wanted technology is drone defense.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.000]   Like how do you defend against drones on both sides?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.100]   And anybody that comes up
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.440]   with an autonomous drone technology
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.600]   is going to help whichever side uses that technology
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.760]   to gain a military advantage.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.360]   And so there's a huge incentive to build that technology.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.760]   But then of course,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.920]   once both sides started using that technology,
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.880]   then there's swarms of autonomous drones
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.920]   that don't give a shit about humans,
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.160]   just killing everything in sight on both sides.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.480]   And that's terrifying.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.240]   There's civilian deaths that are possible
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.200]   that are terrifying,
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.320]   especially when you look 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.240]   - Yes, I mean, it's surreal.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.080]   Like when we went to Kurslan,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.000]   he was like the entire sky is just full of drones
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.320]   at any given time, they could decide to come and attack.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.320]   So like just the, they could just sit there forever waiting,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.160]   waiting for you to come out of that building.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.800]   They'll wait a long time when someone goes and hides inside
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.200]   or potentially if it's open window,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.560]   fly straight through the open window to get people.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.360]   - Yeah, so you're not even safe indoors.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.920]   - Yeah, there's nowhere to hide.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.680]   And they can wait for a very, very long time.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.400]   - And as far as I know, even politicians,
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.600]   like you're in danger everywhere in Ukraine.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.360]   So if you want to do a public speaking thing
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.200]   and doing outside, you're in danger
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.280]   because it's very difficult to detect those drones.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.600]   It could be anywhere.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.080]   So it's a terrifying life where you don't know
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.560]   if you're safe at any moment, anywhere in Ukraine.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.200]   - Well, sure, I mean, it's crazy what happened to Trump.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.960]   I thought maybe the next attack on a public figure
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.600]   might come in the form of drone technology,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.840]   some sort of something along those lines.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.120]   I wonder how they protect against that here.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.520]   - If that happens, just imagine the insanity
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.880]   that would ensue.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   'Cause we understand the idea of a gunman with a rifle
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.400]   shooting somebody, but just like a drone,
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.480]   just imagine the conspiracy theories.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.560]   Who controlled that drone?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.760]   - Where'd it come from, yeah.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.840]   - And now everybody, I mean, that will just cause chaos.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.640]   - And the range is ever increasing.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.320]   One of the battalions in Ukraine,
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.520]   'cause those FPV drones have short range,
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.440]   pretty short range, but they were able to attach it
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.120]   to one of the larger drones with a signal booster.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.800]   So they could potentially go up to 30, 40 kilometers
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.640]   into the distance.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.600]   So the drone that hits you could be flown by someone.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.320]   So far away from you.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.840]   And if they did that domestically,
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.960]   that would be very frightening to think of the sphere
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.880]   of where it could have come from.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.400]   - Do they, when you've talked to the soldiers there,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.520]   did they have a hope or a vision how the war will end?
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.320]   - Not really.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.200]   I guess it just seems to everyone that it's sort of,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.120]   there's gonna be no middle ground.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.880]   - When I was there, there's a kind of optimism
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.000]   that there would be victorious, like definitively.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.080]   And so is there still that optimism?
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.080]   And also, are they ready for a prolonged war?
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.800]   - I mean, I think it would be a soldier by soldier basis.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.720]   I know like each of them had a different perspective.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.240]   I remember I would ask them about like,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   in terms of U.S. politics and their fears,
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.800]   'cause the first year I went there, U.S. hadn't agreed.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.080]   - Yeah. - To resupply weapons.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.960]   So it was a very different feeling in the air there
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.240]   of concern over what was gonna happen,
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.280]   but they still remained quite optimistic
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.800]   that no matter who got in,
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.840]   they felt would do the right thing.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.480]   But in terms of prolonged war,
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.120]   most people think it's gonna go for a very long time,
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.960]   like the children's hospital that just was bombed in Kyiv.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.640]   Anytime there's a moment like that,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.320]   that reignites everything.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.320]   And I think it happens on both sides.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:40.080]   So I know that there was an attack in Crimea.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.040]   It was an attack on a beach, I guess.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.880]   And I don't know if that attack on the hospital
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.040]   was retribution for that,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.960]   but that's sort of the energy that is felt.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.520]   Like they might have battle fatigue,
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.440]   but when something happens to civilians,
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.840]   especially kids on your side,
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.000]   kind of reinvigorates the energy to fight
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.680]   for as long as necessary.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   And in terms of a case-by-case basis,
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.800]   one of my friends, Dmitry, over there,
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.760]   who trains jiu-jitsu and is a gym,
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.640]   he was very passionate about it just 'cause of the history.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.840]   Like he brought out documents of his grandfather
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.360]   being executed by the USSR.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.720]   So I know that when the war started,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.480]   he took a bicycle helmet in his AK-47
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.400]   and went out into the streets.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.200]   And he's like, "I'd rather be dead
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.440]   "than live under Russian rule again."
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.200]   So I mean, very case-by-case basis,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.360]   sort of personal history for them, I think.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.640]   - Did they comment on US politics,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.320]   whether they hope for Trump or for, in that situation,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.960]   Biden, now Harris, to win the presidential election?
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.920]   - I think most of the guys tried to keep it pretty positive.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.960]   Like some people did think that maybe if Trump was elected,
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.680]   he wouldn't continue to fund it,
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.720]   but they really tried to stay optimistic.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.400]   Most of the people I spoke to
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.120]   really tried to remain optimistic
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.520]   that they would be protected if it comes down to it.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.560]   But obviously there was a nine-month period
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.120]   where they weren't refunded.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.880]   So as that stretched, obviously they're refunded now,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.000]   but it takes a lot of time to get that equipment back
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.760]   to the points at which they need it.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.160]   So I mean, if ammunition had ran out,
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.320]   Patriot defense system had ran out,
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   really, really sort of scary prospect there.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.200]   I don't know what's,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.400]   I guess no one knows what's gonna happen there, but.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.400]   - Did you lie to people
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.720]   and say you were close to the president
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.880]   so they can be nice to you?
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.320]   Like, so they can convince you to continue the funding?
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.880]   - I'm an Australian diplomat.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.480]   - Diplomat. (laughs)
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.560]   Yeah, that could be a nice way in.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.000]   - Yeah, that would have been a nice way to the top.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.800]   Luckily for me, most of the place I travel to,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.960]   jujitsu gives me access to so many different individuals.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.920]   It's super bizarre.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.400]   Like oligarchs, royalty, I guess tech wizards,
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.200]   just this, it's a strange group of people,
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.560]   like a code around the world of just,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.960]   I get strange access just for being good
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.320]   at wrestling dudes.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.980]   - Yeah, martial arts, there's like a code
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.440]   and there's a respect, a mutual respect.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.080]   Even if you don't know anything about the other person,
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.520]   if you both have done martial arts,
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.840]   I mean, there's similar things with judo,
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.480]   with jujitsu, with grappling, all that.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.600]   I don't know what that is.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.560]   - It's like an inner circle.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.400]   That's kind of like,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.640]   'cause this film project we're working on,
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.200]   it's kind of focused on that,
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.840]   is because of the history I have in jujitsu
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.640]   and traveling and doing seminars
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.960]   and just getting access to strange experiences
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.580]   from the local, strange in a positive way,
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.400]   and participating in those experiences,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.680]   that's what I sort of wanted to focus this travel show on,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.160]   was the community of jujitsu people around the world
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   kind of really has no sort of ethnic background,
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.080]   religious background, even level of wealth.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.560]   I could say, as cheesy as it sounds,
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.600]   kind of a good equalizer on the mats
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.920]   and that community comradery sort of knows no limits there.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.400]   - Including like mats, the shittiest mats
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.640]   in some small town in the middle of nowhere.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.480]   - 100%.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.720]   Even like Sheikh Tahnoon, who started ADCC,
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.060]   I know when he went to the US and he studied there,
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.560]   he would train at a very simple gym.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.200]   He wouldn't declare who he was.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.800]   Like I watched a documentary produced
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.640]   about sort of the story of Sheikh Tahnoon
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.960]   and how he studied in America,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.280]   basically in anonymity.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.520]   The people at his gym didn't know who he was in his country,
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.240]   and he trained there, he trained with them for years,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.640]   cleaned their mats like anyone else,
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.880]   and then they didn't realize who he was
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.320]   until he said, "Hey, I wanna invite you to my country."
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.480]   But he actually meant basically as royalty come,
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.360]   and then they realized who this guy was
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.840]   and the significance of him.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.360]   - That's gangster, that's great.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.320]   One of the things I love about Nogi jujitsu
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.720]   is like you don't see rank.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.040]   So on a small scale, there's no hierarchy
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.820]   that emerges when you have the different color belts.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.120]   Everybody's kind of the same.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.040]   It's nice.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.760]   You get to like-- - See the skill.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.640]   - The skill speaks,
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.000]   but there's just like a mutual respect and whatever.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.480]   I mean, you can quickly find out who.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.880]   I actually wonder if I would be able
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.960]   to figure out the rank of a person.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.880]   You think you can usually figure out
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.680]   how long a person's been doing jujitsu?
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.840]   - I like to think with some of the aggressive
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.060]   clothing choices I've made and sold in the sport
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.620]   that that should be a beacon,
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.200]   that that person-- - Is a blue belt.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.880]   - Has hopefully some talent,
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.180]   'cause they're fearlessly provoking the other party there.
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.560]   - Oh, it's like in the jungle,
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.480]   whenever there's like a insect that's red,
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.000]   that is like really flamboyant looking,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.320]   that means they're dangerous.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.000]   - It's a target, yeah, though, being flamboyant.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.760]   If you come on the mats with something pink,
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.160]   a pink gi or something, people are circling in fast,
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.720]   especially in Eastern Europe.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.800]   - Okay, so yeah, you mentioned the project.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.640]   Can you talk about that?
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.760]   I saw there's a preview that you showed,
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.560]   Craig Jones gone walkabout.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.960]   - Gone walkabout, yeah.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.160]   - And so you showed a preview in Indonesia
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.220]   where you're both kind of celebrating
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.200]   and maybe poking a bit of fun at Hicks and Gracie.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.040]   - Hicks and Gracie, yeah.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.040]   So I like to match looks from time to time in an homage.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.800]   - You look sexy.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.500]   - It's comfortable, actually, I enjoy it.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.080]   - Yeah, you should keep it.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.280]   - Oh, I only wear this now.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.020]   I wear this for the Gabby match.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.800]   I mean, yeah, we're trying to do a documentary series
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.560]   'cause the way I see it is I wanna grow the sport of jiu-jitsu
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.760]   and this sounds funny to say now
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.680]   'cause I'm doing a tournament,
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.040]   but everyone tries to do it through competition.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.640]   But as we know, most jiu-jitsu gyms you visit,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.760]   a very small percentage of people compete,
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.560]   let alone compete regularly.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.640]   You go to gyms that could be brown or black belts
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.440]   that don't know many of the big name competitors.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.920]   So my thoughts were,
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   we're never gonna grow this sport by competition.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.440]   We're gonna grow it by appealing
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.040]   to the large majority of people that do it,
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.780]   which are just people that enjoy it for the benefits
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.480]   it provides to them, whether health or psychological.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.140]   And obviously, many people inspired by Anthony Bourdain,
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:11.680]   basically, he's looking at what he did with food
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.720]   by showing the very interesting characters
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.800]   in the food culture and the food industries,
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.320]   especially with street food and building around that.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.240]   So I'm trying to look at jiu-jitsu like a giant cult.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.560]   Scientology isn't starting with Planet Zeno,
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.440]   it's starting with John Travolta and Tom Cruise.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.000]   So we can create a documentary travel series
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.760]   highlighting the diverse, interesting people
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.600]   that participate in the sport.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.780]   In that sense, I hope we can grow up,
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.920]   but also doing some charity work along the way.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.560]   Like we'll release the Indonesia Bali episode pretty soon,
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.080]   but as an Australian, I do do a lot of damage culturally
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.900]   around the world, so I'd like to do some good as well.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.640]   We've done a lot of damage to Bali,
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.080]   so we'll give back to local communities.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.480]   We have an Australian there that runs an academy,
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.800]   Academy Christos.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.080]   He's one of the guys we're donating a portion
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.200]   of the ticket sales to from our event.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.840]   But he basically went straight into a Balinese slum,
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.680]   started teaching jiu-jitsu on a mat under a tree,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.720]   and then slowly through donations has built a gym.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.800]   And his real focus is not just taking money from people
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.040]   and gifting it to them to help the community,
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.480]   but to teach them skills.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.320]   So he'll take a lot of the disadvantaged kids
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.560]   and he'll teach them things like photo editing
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.800]   so they can get that work from the internet really.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.360]   Incredible guy.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.760]   - It's good to know that you see yourself
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.360]   as the John Travolta of jiu-jitsu.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.680]   - Many masseuses have accused me
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.720]   of the same thing, unfortunately.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.160]   All lies.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.400]   - Yeah, there's a lot of similarities
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.680]   between the two of you.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.360]   So you mentioned Anthony Bourdain.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.320]   What do you like about the guy?
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.480]   What do you find inspiring and instructive
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.280]   about the way he was able to, as you said,
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.340]   scratch beneath the surface of a place?
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.400]   - I just felt like he was very authentic, wasn't afraid.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.680]   Like this is something I had trouble with
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.280]   when we first started doing the travel show.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.560]   It's easy to do a travel show
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.000]   if you only say positive things about a place, you know?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.560]   But he would find a very creative way
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.960]   to show what's good and bad,
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.600]   a very honest reflection of the place.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.360]   So that's something I would strive to do.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.040]   However, in some places it's very difficult.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:19.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.240]   Like for example, Kazakhstan.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.040]   If I were to say something negative about Kazakhstan,
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   they'd be like, "Who's this foreign idiot
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.560]   talking about our culture?"
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.840]   And I think that was what was incredible about Bourdain
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.800]   is he could talk about both the good and bad of places
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.400]   and he would do it in such a way that it was tasteful
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   and was respected by the locals.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.560]   - Yeah, that's actually a skill
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.280]   that you're incredibly good at.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.680]   You make fun of a lot of people, but there's something,
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.180]   maybe there's an underlying respect.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.140]   Maybe it's the accent.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.440]   Maybe, I don't know what it is.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.680]   There's a love underneath your trolling.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.040]   - I like to think so.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.200]   Hopefully, yeah.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.800]   Gabby Garcia.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.080]   There's a deep, passionate love underneath the trolling.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:00.920]   - Yeah.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.280]   Speaking of which, let's talk about CGI.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.300]   You're putting on the CGI tournament.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.000]   It's in about a week.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.720]   Same weekend as ADCC, $3 million budget,
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.200]   two divisions, two super fights.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.100]   Winner of each division gets $1 million.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:22.280]   Everyone gets $10,000.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.320]   How do you even say that?
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.160]   Plus one.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.000]   - 10,000 plus one, yeah.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.840]   - Plus one.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.720]   Just to compete.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.600]   So it's August 16th and 17th.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.080]   Everybody should get tickets.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.960]   Same weekend as ADCC, which is August 17th.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.080]   Okay, so what's the mission of what you're doing there?
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.040]   - The mission has always been, first and foremost,
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.720]   increase athlete pay.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.600]   So ADCC has invested a ton into the sport.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.800]   Obviously, I mentioned Sheikh Tanu.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.000]   Sheikh Tanu has done so much for the sport of grappling,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   particularly no-gi grappling.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.160]   So he's growing it.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.760]   He has funded this for a very, very long time.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.560]   But we've kind of hit a point since 2017
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.560]   where the audience, the crowd watching live and at home
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.200]   behind a paywall has grown considerably.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.880]   We had things like MetaMorris,
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.040]   we had the Eddie Bravo Invitational, Polaris,
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.160]   all these sort of professional events
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.440]   that have also contributed to growing the sport.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.960]   And obviously, people like Gordon Ryan
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.560]   have definitely increased the popularity of the sport.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.560]   But the payment for ADCC has never gone up.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.120]   Despite, again, the growth of it.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.360]   So what I did, a lot of fans were asking me
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   earlier in the year, they said, "Okay, you're gonna do ADCC?"
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.280]   And I said, "That is a big commitment of time, energy,
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.440]   "expenses on steroids to get my body ready for a tournament
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.240]   "that I'll probably lose.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.720]   "And if I lose on day one, I make $0.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.960]   "If I lose on the final,
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.680]   "which I have done a couple of times, I only get $6,000.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.480]   "I think third place is $3,000.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.840]   "Fourth place is $1,000.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.040]   "So if you make day two, you get paid."
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.280]   But for me personally, seeing ADCC 2022,
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   you're looking out to a sold out crowd of like 10,000 people.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.720]   It's on Flow Grappling, which you know,
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.120]   paid quite a bit of money for the streaming rights.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.200]   I can't comment on what that number would be.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.560]   And then you go home,
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.600]   despite having put in all that effort with only $6,000.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.280]   And they basically, the argument is you're paid an exposure.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.040]   But again, there's many ways to expose yourself.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:33.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.080]   That's just one of the platforms to do so.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.320]   My problem was that they announced
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.440]   they were gonna go from Thomas & Mac to T-Mobile,
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.600]   which is a jump in quality of stadium,
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.000]   but not a significant jump in sort of seating.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.120]   So we've gone from like 11,000 seat arena
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.320]   to I think a 15, 16,000 seat arena.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.200]   And I knew that Flow Grappling
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.760]   would have had to pay more money
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   'cause now the sport's growing so much.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.000]   And I can personally kind of track the growth of the sport
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.240]   through selling instructional DVDs,
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.880]   instructional online products, 'cause that keeps growing.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.000]   And we're targeting those white and blue belts
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.960]   vulnerable to internet marketing.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.720]   And that audience continues to grow.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.080]   And those will be the people that largely watch ADCC,
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.800]   events like this.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.440]   So I simply said, in response to a lot of fans asking me,
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.000]   why are you gonna do ADCC?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.120]   And I just simply made a video saying,
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.000]   no, probably not, probably not.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.760]   Be nice to make some more money.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.960]   And then I listed a bunch of sports such as cock bar
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.760]   that you get paid more to win cock bar.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.360]   In the villages of Kazakhstan,
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.440]   the payment structure is higher.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.680]   And I received a very aggressive response,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.080]   not from any of Sheikh Tahnoon's people,
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.560]   but from basically who runs the event today.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.040]   One of those guys amongst giving me death threats said,
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.200]   hey, T-Mobile costs $2 million.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.600]   You don't know what you're talking about
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.240]   in terms of business and production.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.840]   And he's probably right.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.680]   But to me, $2 million is a waste of money
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.000]   for a jujitsu event.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.040]   I don't think we're at that level yet.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.480]   Like that's where the UFC host events.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   $2 million, that's an expensive, expensive venue.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.880]   So we argued a bit on the internet and he said,
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.480]   hey, if you don't like it,
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.760]   why don't you go get $2 million
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.920]   and put on your own tournament?
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.160]   And I said, I might just do that.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.840]   And one of my anonymous friends
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.360]   kindly donated a $3 million budget.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.200]   And I actually messaged him before the show to say,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.480]   hey, we won't reveal your identity
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.000]   'cause obviously anyone that has money
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.560]   is gonna get asked for more money
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.840]   or asked for money from others.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.120]   So he wants to remain anonymous.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.120]   But he basically just said
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.920]   to enjoy the trolling aspect of it
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.680]   and also contribute to the sport of jujitsu.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.360]   - Well, it's good to know that the anonymous funder
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.760]   appreciates you for who you are, Craig Jones.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.160]   - He sees my true identity and he wants to provoke.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.240]   It's trolling for a good cause.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.040]   But basically we were able to find
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.600]   Thomas and Mac event center,
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.480]   which was their original venue.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:08.080]   And it just so happened to be available that same weekend,
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:08.920]   which we're very happy about.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.880]   And so we booked that out.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.240]   We decided to, ADCC pays 10,000 to the winner.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   We were like, you know what?
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.560]   We'll pay $10,000 plus one to show up.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.880]   So to show up in our event,
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.320]   you're gonna get paid more than to win ADCC.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.120]   And not only that, we're gonna broadcast it for free.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.160]   So on MetaX and YouTube,
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.520]   you'll be able to watch this event for free.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.360]   - That's amazing.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.720]   - It's very considerate to the Flow Grappling
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.200]   streaming platform, I believe,
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.080]   to have also a free alternative on the same weekend.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.000]   And the brilliance of this whole thing
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.880]   is I was largely criticized
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.240]   for not knowing anything about business,
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.040]   but the people criticizing me
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.240]   decided to host a tournament at 15,000 seat arena.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.240]   They decided to take sponsors.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.800]   They decided to use a stream platform
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.520]   which sells subscriptions based on the athletes
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.600]   that would enter it,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.920]   but not give any of the talent, the athletes, a contract,
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.880]   which gave me this beautiful position to basically say,
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.720]   hey, what do you prefer?
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   The prestige of an ADCC gold medal or money.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.160]   And that's the fuse so far.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.040]   And we put that out into the world.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.120]   I didn't chase too many athletes down.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.160]   Obviously a lot of these guys really need money.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.600]   So you throw a million dollars out there,
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.440]   people are jumping on board.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.000]   So initially we started getting,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.800]   we got two local guys here in Austin,
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.920]   the Tackett brothers, they jumped in first.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.760]   And they're great kids.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.120]   They really legitimize the whole thing
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.400]   'cause if we pick certain athletes
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.400]   like just B team guys straight away,
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.160]   it's already looking a bit dodgy,
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.520]   but we've got some legitimate athletes,
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.840]   especially the under 80 kilo divisions
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.880]   full of minus two or three guys.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.760]   That's the best people in the world
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.040]   in that weight division.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.160]   And as we started to grow our roster here,
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.360]   what happened, I'm gonna say this allegedly
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.120]   for legal reasons,
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.160]   is that the first move ADCC did
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.320]   was they matched the female pay to the men's pay.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.280]   So the women always traditionally got paid less,
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.600]   I think $6,000 for first place.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.680]   As soon as we had Fion Davies,
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.600]   the reigning champion come across
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.960]   to do a super fight with us, bang.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.240]   ADCC raised the prize money of the women's division
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.720]   to equal the men's.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.560]   So me being a feminist activist
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.080]   throughout many of my years on this earth
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.760]   immediately got women's pay raised
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.400]   in the sport of jujitsu, equalized basically.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.640]   Which went counter to everything the promoter had said
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.360]   'cause he said it was out of his control to raise money.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.320]   He said only the ADCC, I guess,
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.520]   coming directly from the Sheik
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.600]   or the Sheik's sort of guys could raise the prize money.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.360]   He got it raised.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.600]   And then what happened was
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.760]   once we started getting some of these big names here,
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.960]   so some of the best guys from ADCC
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.920]   would be in this division.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.040]   We got a bunch of champions or medalists
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.960]   or really the top betting favorites
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.080]   for their divisions there.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.880]   They started, again, I can't emphasize this enough,
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.720]   allegedly paying show money,
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.200]   which has never historically been done before
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.000]   to keep athletes in their show.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.260]   - So you're saying, allegedly,
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:15.920]   there was some under the table payments by ADCC.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.160]   Do you have secret documents proving this?
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.280]   - I do have the documents.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.880]   Now, some of the guys obviously told me,
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.800]   you know how it is,
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.840]   you slap a million dollars on the table, it looks great.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.440]   That was me proving I had the money,
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.840]   which wasn't even my money to begin with.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.800]   But it was basically me saying, hey, the money's real.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.760]   I don't know why, but strangely,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.000]   a lot of people don't believe me
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:33.840]   when I'm telling the truth.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.920]   - I don't know why they wouldn't.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.140]   - But what logically happens is they're like,
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.400]   oh, look at how much money he has.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.320]   We're gonna give, like, give us more show money.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.080]   So they're negotiating with me.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.720]   There was one particular Brazilian businessman,
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.820]   manager, I won't say his name,
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.800]   but he looks like the thing from "Fantastic Four,"
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.800]   and he was a manager for some of these athletes.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.960]   And he would take a massive 20% cut.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.760]   So what he, and I gotta pay respect to this,
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.080]   respect to this, 'cause it actually caused trauma
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.600]   to the other team as well.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.480]   But he would, I would invite an athlete to CJI.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.880]   He would go to the other organization
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.800]   and he would say to them, hey,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   what sort of deal could you give me to keep this guy?
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.320]   You wanna keep him in your event?
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:22.560]   And he would use CJI to leverage more show money
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.800]   for his guys, of which he gets to grease the wheels
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.480]   with 20% for himself.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:32.480]   However, at CJI, everyone gets $10,001 across the board
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.400]   and a million dollars prize money.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.320]   So there's no room for really negotiation
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.680]   for the tournament aspect of us.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:42.120]   So he has a vested interest in putting his guys in ADCC
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.920]   'cause he can negotiate show money
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.440]   and he can basically take 20% of that for himself.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.800]   But really, for the sport of grappling,
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.040]   this is incredible across the board
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.720]   because by us stealing or at least borrowing
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.640]   a bunch of athletes from ADCC,
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.120]   ADCC had to fill their divisions.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.920]   So they filled their divisions with many other competitors
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.760]   that wouldn't have ordinarily had the chance to do ADCC.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:10.960]   And really, although we've scheduled it the same weekend,
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.320]   ours is actually Friday, Saturday,
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.000]   ADCC being Saturday, Sunday, our day starts pretty late.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.440]   So we start 5 p.m. Saturday.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.680]   So really, ultimately it was a big marketing ploy
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.600]   to go head to head,
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.280]   pretending like we're making the fans choose,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.440]   but the fans will be able to watch both events.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.680]   You'd be able to go all day Friday for us.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.480]   You'll sadly miss the ADCC Hall of Fame ceremony
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.000]   where you'll see many of great speakers,
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.760]   public speakers, philosophers,
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.640]   tell their stories about hardship.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.560]   Just like at the end of any jujitsu seminar
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.080]   or beginning, if you're blessed like that,
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.200]   you might have a 45-minute monologue
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.920]   about how they're more knowledgeable than doctors, lawyers,
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.560]   classic black belt technique,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.400]   but you will miss that.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.680]   - With great metaphors about lions.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.960]   - About lions, yes.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.320]   About being a humble lion, most importantly.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.760]   - Humility is important.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.040]   - You can watch all that Friday.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.520]   You could watch most of ADCC Saturday.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:08.280]   And then Saturday night in Las Vegas,
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.800]   I'll be doing what many men have done before,
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.480]   and that is wrestling a giant woman.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.120]   - Can you speak to that?
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:22.080]   How are you preparing for this moment of violence
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.920]   on a Saturday night with Gabby Garcia?
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:29.920]   - So Gabby Garcia is the legend of women's grappling.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   I think she's won more than anyone else.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.880]   So between me and her,
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.320]   we would at least have 15 to 20 world championships,
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:40.040]   I'd imagine.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.640]   She's huge.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.000]   I say that in an endearing way.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.560]   She might be six foot four, six foot three,
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.800]   and her weight varies depending on what time of the day it is
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.760]   between 220 and 275 pounds,
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.920]   but she's gonna be coming in quite big and strong.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.920]   Me, I am about 179 pounds right now and a five foot 11.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:04.560]   So I've got a significant size disadvantage.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.120]   She has the credentials, but we're gonna scrap it out,
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.280]   scrap it out and see who's best,
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.680]   the greatest women's competitor of all time,
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.840]   or a guy that's never won anything.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.920]   - Has it added some complexity to the picture
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.600]   that there's some sexual tension in the room
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.680]   whenever the two of you are together?
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.520]   - Yeah.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.400]   - Or maybe I'm being romantic,
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.320]   but it seems like there's,
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.920]   you've slowly started to fall in love with each other.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.080]   - It's been three years of seduction.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.240]   It's been a long time.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.140]   - It's inspiring for many young men
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.920]   that follow you and look up to you.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.360]   Just the romantic journey that you've been on,
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.320]   it's truly inspiring.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.640]   - Yeah, I would say it's a motivational message
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.120]   to the guy that keeps sending DMs
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.800]   to a girl on Instagram for years.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.560]   That maybe after three years,
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.520]   it could also happen for you too.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:58.560]   No matter her height and weight,
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.640]   I think persistence is the key here.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.480]   - Yeah.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.540]   - And we do have a wager on the line.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.380]   - What's the wager?
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.240]   - This might be the first wager of its kind,
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.680]   I would hope, in combat sports history.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:16.520]   If she wins, I'll personally give her a million dollars.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.200]   If I can footlock her,
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   we're gonna collaborate together
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.300]   in an OnlyFans sex tape.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.040]   - Did she agree to this?
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.660]   - She shook on it.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.860]   (laughing)
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.700]   - Great.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.960]   You do have an OnlyFans channel.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.680]   Is that still up?
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.140]   - After August 17th, it's gonna be firing.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.720]   - It's gonna be on fire.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.560]   Wow.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.380]   - I think that, and honestly,
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.680]   when we talk about "Cigarette Investor,"
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.520]   I think that could fund the entire tournament.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.360]   It'd be that successful.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.920]   - That'll be the only paywalled thing
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.960]   about this tournament is your OnlyFans.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.220]   - Yeah, it's gonna be a spiritual experience for me.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.540]   - Yeah.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.380]   Wow.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.760]   (laughing)
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.200]   Okay, I'm fully distracted now.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.000]   Can you talk about the ruleset?
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.920]   - So we're using the angled walls
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.100]   inspired by "Karate Kombat."
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.160]   "Karate Kombat" did those angled walls.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.000]   - Those are awesome.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.040]   You're calling it the alley.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.920]   That's really, really interesting.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.760]   So it's like in a pit, I guess,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.960]   and the angled walls are--
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.680]   - Yeah, so "Karate Kombat" have a square pit.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.320]   We have a rectangular alley.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.940]   We like the visual of just,
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.080]   you're in the alley with someone, you know?
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.760]   We both know what goes on an alley.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.720]   Only a couple things that could go on back there.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.240]   - What's the second thing?
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.280]   Nevermind.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.120]   I got it.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.300]   - But why this is brilliant,
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.600]   why the angled walls are brilliant for grappling
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.840]   is because any grappling tournament,
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.920]   this goes, without question, goes IBJJF, ADCC.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.160]   The reset is one of the most annoying aspects of the sport,
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.600]   and one of the aspects of the sport
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.640]   that some of the sneakier guys take advantage of.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.200]   There's guys out there that are brilliant
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.420]   at playing the edge.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.200]   Open the ref, we'll reset him,
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.320]   or they'll shoot a takedown near the edge.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.800]   And you might watch, and again, I'm picking on ADCC here,
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.160]   but you might watch an ADCC match
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.600]   where 90 seconds of a 10-minute match
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.480]   is the referee grabbing them,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.060]   bringing them back to the center,
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:11.160]   or trying to recreate something of a position
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.000]   that landed outside.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.320]   Not only is that sort of boring to me,
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.560]   and it sort of could be bias.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.880]   Again, it's happened to me in events
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.120]   where the ref's gone, "Stop."
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.320]   I've stopped, he's moved a little bit more,
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.480]   and then there's an adjustment in the reset.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.080]   I mean, it's cheating to a certain extent,
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.900]   but it's just more of an annoyance.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.200]   They bring it back, they reset it
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.960]   to the best of their ability in the center.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.440]   The angled wall mitigates that,
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.600]   and it mitigates it in such a way
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.080]   that it's a disadvantage to be pushed up
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.080]   against the angled wall.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.800]   You're very easily taken down against the angled wall.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.000]   You could use a cage like the UFC does
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.160]   or any sort of MMA organization.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.240]   However, cage wrestling can be slow.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.880]   You're obviously at the vertical,
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.280]   and it can stagnate there.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.480]   Guys are very good at using split squats
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.680]   to really defend that position.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.680]   And for me personally, I don't love the cage for grappling.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.880]   I'd like to differentiate it for grappling.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.240]   What holds people back from using the alley
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.200]   or a pit-like structure is the viewing, the viewing angle.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.320]   'Cause obviously if you're one of the VIPs
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.680]   or you pay for an expensive seat,
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.200]   that angled wall's above you.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   A cage you can see into an elevated platform sort of stage.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.760]   You can see clearly into 'cause it's basically flat,
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.840]   but the athletes could fall off and injure themselves.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.040]   So something happens, UFC fire passes,
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.360]   the elevated flat stage.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.760]   It's kind of scary to be near the edge.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.480]   You go off, you're gonna land on concrete.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.200]   You might wanna do that to the other guy
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.600]   if you're that way inclined.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.160]   But the alley, the angled wall solves all those problems.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.320]   Very minimal referee interference.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.600]   Again, the only thing that holds people back
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.360]   is the expense of building it.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:59.080]   But again, when you're spending someone else's money,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.240]   you will spare no expense in production.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.720]   So we've spent a lot of money on the alley,
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.800]   and we've really gone out of our way
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.280]   to create an experience that around the alley,
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.080]   we've elevated everything so that the people watching
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.960]   will be able to see down into it.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   'Cause your instinctual thought is,
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.360]   "Oh, it sounds great, but how am I gonna see in it
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.600]   "unless I'm far up?"
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.240]   Like you'd need like a Coliseum-like structure,
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.480]   which is basically what we've attempted to create
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.680]   so that you get both a perfect place to wrestle,
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.560]   to grapple in, as well as a perfect viewing angle
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.640]   for the fans.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.240]   - Well, I think it's an amazing idea.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.680]   What about the jiu-jitsu on a slant?
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.120]   You've triangled somebody on a slant.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.600]   Is there some interesting aspects
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.920]   about the actual detailed techniques
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.760]   of how to be effective using a slant?
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.840]   - I'll be honest, I competed for "Karate Kombat" twice.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.880]   Never once did I ever step foot into the pit.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.200]   Just, again, like you said before the podcast,
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.400]   if there's a right way of doing things,
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.360]   I'm probably doing it the opposite.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.200]   - The wrong way.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.000]   I actually have no idea why people take advice from you
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.840]   if they do.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.400]   - I'm mostly an inspirational speaker at this point.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.720]   - You and Tony Robbins are like this.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.920]   - Same size, at least.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.520]   But in terms of the training for it,
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.800]   obviously the athlete's very difficult.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.800]   Some of these guys have gone out there
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.600]   and built their own angled walls.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.440]   - Yeah, I saw that.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.720]   There's a cool video of that.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.560]   - They're getting into that.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.440]   That's a smart thing to do.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.000]   There's a million dollars on the line.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.520]   You should probably invest in that.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.640]   But I also like a new surface that no one's competed on.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.560]   No one's gamed it yet.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.400]   No one's like, "We're gonna see it unfold."
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.000]   Like when UFC, when people started figuring out
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.360]   how to use the cage.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.040]   We're gonna see this unfold in front of our very eyes,
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.880]   how the strategies work for this.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.160]   The other thing we've done too is we're doing rounds.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.080]   So qualifying rounds would be three five-minute rounds.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.040]   The final would be five-fives.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.080]   Why I wanna do that is to incentivize action.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.680]   We're gonna incentivize action through penalizing people,
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.560]   but we really want, I love a short burst, a break,
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.960]   and the guys can go hard again.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.320]   I don't like a jujitsu match
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.760]   where the guy takes the back early and he's like,
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.720]   "Oh, if I keep this position, I've won."
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.440]   And that's something that people that don't compete
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.240]   don't realize is if you get a good position early,
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.640]   get up on the points.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.880]   You just sit there and go, "Oh, let's ride this to the end."
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.840]   That's why I want rounds so that you might take guys back.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.000]   You really incentivize to get that finish.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.440]   And the way we're trying to grow the sport
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.360]   is to steal the MMA scoring structure,
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.040]   which a lot of people have criticized
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.480]   'cause they think it's overly complicated.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.240]   They don't understand it.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.920]   But to the mass audience,
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.760]   they understand a 10-point must understand a decision
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.160]   in that sense, understand it being scored round by round.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.400]   So we're trying to appeal to a broader audience here,
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.600]   but we think based on the structure,
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.560]   based on how hard we'll call stalling penalties,
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.880]   based on you wanting to finish your opponent quick
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.400]   to have a better chance at a million dollars,
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.760]   'cause it's 10,001 to show up and a million to win.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.000]   If you ain't first, you're last.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.920]   There's no reward for second place.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.840]   So I'm punishing the one position
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.440]   I've only ever been able to achieve in tournaments.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.160]   - Are you worried that because of how much money
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.000]   is on the line, people will play careful?
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.240]   - A very generous friend of mine has provided this money.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.720]   I'm like, "Unless you guys go out there
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.960]   and try to kill each other and put it all on the line,
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   I just won't do it again."
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.200]   Like I'm giving you guys a massive platform.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.800]   We've turned down offers from streaming platforms
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.680]   that wanted to buy the rights to this event
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.720]   'cause the marketing's gone very well.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.080]   We're turning down money to grow the sport.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.040]   The ADCC promoter said he wanted to grow the sport.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.280]   So what he did is he put it behind a paywall
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.560]   and he used the money from the paywall
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.520]   to buy a more expensive arena.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.720]   I don't think that's how you grow the sport.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.160]   I think you grow the sport like comedians do these days.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.680]   Guys like Mark Norman will release a special for free.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.720]   Andrew Schultz did it first, released a special for free
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.200]   and it grew his audience massively.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.560]   I think that's what jiu-jitsu needs.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.600]   We need an exciting show that's not behind a paywall
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.360]   that'll grow the sport, grow the audience,
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.040]   and really then ultimately we can get to a level
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.000]   where it could be behind a paywall,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.320]   but I just don't think where they at.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.120]   - Yeah, I think a million dollars is a lot of money,
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.760]   but the opportunity here,
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.720]   because it's open and freely accessible by everyone,
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.400]   is to put on a show.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.080]   - And then you get a million every year.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.200]   If this is a crazy exciting event,
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.160]   the funding's gonna be so easy year after year.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.360]   And the other aspect we're doing to it is,
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.480]   unfortunately, I'm not gonna make any money off this thing.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.560]   It's a non-profit and the money from charity--
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.480]   - Except the OnlyFans, but whatever, yeah.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.240]   - That's the real cash cow.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.640]   But that's the real work too.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.520]   - Yeah, and that's not for charity.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.240]   That's for your personal bank account, the OnlyFans.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.080]   Or you're also--
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.600]   - No, that'll be for the follow-up therapy,
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.800]   but that'll be an expensive gig
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.160]   for whoever takes that on board.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.120]   - Love hurts.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.520]   - That physically will, yeah.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.080]   Ticket proceeds to charity.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.280]   So obviously we've got the $3 million budget.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.880]   We've got production expenses.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.640]   We've got the team of staff to hire.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.040]   But if we could sell this thing out,
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.720]   we could potentially donate a ton of money to charity.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.640]   One of those charities is Tap Cancer Out.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.520]   And what's great about this is Rich Burn
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.160]   is a black belt from New York who's in the banking world.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.840]   He used to run an event called Kasai Grappling.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.360]   He went through cancer.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.320]   He basically had a very aggressive cancer.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.880]   He had it treated.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.640]   And now he basically has said to us
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   that whatever we donate from the profits of the event,
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.800]   he's gonna match dollar for dollar.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.960]   And we've also had another guy who wants
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.880]   to remain anonymous agree to match dollar for dollar
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.720]   as well.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.880]   So the more ticket sales revenue we can create here,
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.560]   the more we can actually give back to charity.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.680]   So it's really all round.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.160]   It's gonna be a great event.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.440]   - Yeah, Tap Cancer Out is great.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.280]   And all the charities
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.080]   that the athletes have been selecting are great.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.280]   What's been the hardest?
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.760]   You are wearing a suit.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.280]   So you figured out how to do that, but--
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.680]   - The tie was difficult, for sure.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.000]   - The tie was difficult, but you figured it out.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.160]   And congratulations on that.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.120]   But you've never run a tournament.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.280]   Nah.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.000]   - I've never wrestled a big woman either.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   Well, I have, but not in this form.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.880]   - Not in a competitive environment for OnlyFans.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.160]   What's been the hardest aspects
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.040]   of actually bringing this to life?
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.520]   - The first one was people believing it was real.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.800]   That was quite difficult.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.280]   And then communicating with the athletes.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.960]   That's basically my responsibility is securing these guys,
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.800]   getting these guys to commit to things.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.000]   It's very difficult.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.920]   There's a reason a few athletes
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.360]   in every sport really stand out.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.840]   And it's kind of professionalism,
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.480]   kind of the way they market themselves.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.960]   And I think those two things do go hand in hand.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.400]   So we're in a sport where there's not enough money,
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.160]   where a lot of these guys do have managers.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.120]   I think in MMA, things would be a lot easier
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:11.960]   for the promoter
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.600]   because you're not talking directly to the athlete.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.360]   You're talking to a guy who might,
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.640]   who's obviously taking a cut,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.480]   but there's a middleman.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.320]   So in a situation where you're talking directly
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.160]   to the athlete, it can be very difficult,
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.120]   can be very annoying,
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.840]   can be very hard to reach these guys.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.600]   They can be very non-committal.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.000]   That, for me, has been one of the biggest challenges.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   The guys that I speak to that are like, "I'm in."
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.840]   And they're like, "I'm out. I'm in."
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.120]   Like navigating this area.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.360]   One other aspect is because we did this basically
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.560]   from idea to event will be less than three months,
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.480]   three and a half months.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.360]   So it's like we're having to do so much
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.040]   in such a short period of time.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.440]   Little things like, of the show money we've given them,
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.960]   they're expected to basically secure their own flight
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.280]   and hotel to the event.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.920]   We're cutting down on staff
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.000]   'cause that would be one of the,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.080]   if I had to coordinate getting these guys flights,
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.760]   I would just jump off a building.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.120]   Like it's hard enough to get them to agree to the event,
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.960]   let alone coordinate, "Hey, what date do you wanna come in?"
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.400]   It's like herding cats.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.040]   So really just the interpersonal stuff's been difficult.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.480]   Obviously going up against ADCC, the legacy event,
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.360]   has been pretty damn difficult as well.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.440]   Well-established, huge history.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.320]   They've been selling tickets for two years.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.680]   Everyone's known it's been coming for two years.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.120]   That thing was largely sold out
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.320]   before we even announced the event.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.440]   So we're going head to head with this event.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.960]   So from a ticket sales perspective, very difficult.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.480]   - What's been, Reddit question,
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.000]   what's been the most surprising people
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   who turned down your invite?
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.560]   - Ooh, I mean, we can name names.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:52.200]   I mean, obviously Kynan, he was a semi-in, semi-out.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.000]   His suggestion was actually to do
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.800]   a second and third place prize rather than a million.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.600]   And I'm like, no, we want all or nothing.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.640]   It's all or nothing here.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.520]   Whether it's a better spectacle, better entertainment,
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.000]   probably more injuries, but it's all or nothing.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.760]   Miki Galvao, the one that got away, that's sad.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.000]   But we got the Rotolos.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.040]   The Rotolos, props to these kids
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.280]   'cause Cade's the reigning champion.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.240]   These are two of the best guys in the sport.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:28.240]   Allegedly were offered pretty significant show money to stay,
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:31.200]   but they hit me up and they said,
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.080]   "Hey, promise us one thing.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.200]   "We're on opposite sides of the brackets
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.320]   "and we'll fight to the death in the final for the million."
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.000]   And we know, everyone knows that.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.360]   We've seen them compete against each other multiple times.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.520]   So that was not a surprise 'cause I know they're good kids,
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.440]   but to basically turn down allegedly show money
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.240]   to do this event, to support the event,
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.400]   to me is incredible.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.280]   Miki Galvao, things would be more complicated there.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.320]   Like obviously, Miki officially joined ADCC
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.400]   before he secured the Rotolos.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.080]   Cade beat him in the final.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.920]   Miki's personally motivated to face off against Cade.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.360]   So he didn't know Cade was in our event
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.560]   before he agreed to ADCC.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.560]   There's more to that story too in terms of Miki doing ADCC
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.960]   because a bunch of the kids in his team,
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:20.120]   I think they're being flown out to do the ADCC kids events.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.280]   So there's like his two teammates,
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.480]   well, at least one of his teammates will be doing
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.200]   the ADCC 66 kilo division.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.840]   So his dad, his coach doesn't really wanna split time
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.080]   between two events.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.600]   That's a difficulty for athletes there.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.520]   But obviously disappointing, we couldn't secure Miki.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.520]   Miki said he was about the legacy.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.520]   So he wanted to be the youngest guy ever
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.000]   to double Grand Slam,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.080]   which is basically win all the Gi events
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.840]   and win the ADCC that same year.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.920]   My thoughts were, if I was in his position
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.000]   and I never was obviously a prodigy, a talent like that,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.320]   is I thought he had a position
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.760]   to make a statement in the sport
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.560]   to kind of, as cheesy as it sounds,
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.440]   be on the right side of history.
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.720]   To have turned down a double Grand Slam
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.160]   to be in an event that supports athlete pay.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.640]   Again, I don't overly criticize him,
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.360]   but I think in terms of your legacy and reputation,
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.440]   to be at a point and choose to do that
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.400]   is much more memorable
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.600]   than him getting that double Grand Slam,
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.280]   which I'm sure he will win
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.920]   the ADCC 77 kilo division this year,
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:33.480]   but it will be somewhat tarnished anyway.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.720]   So I do feel bad for some of the athletes that win this year
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.240]   and potentially people will be like,
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.400]   "Oh yeah, but that was half the people
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.240]   "weren't in the division."
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.480]   I feel bad for those guys,
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.320]   but at the end of the day,
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.760]   most of these guys had an opportunity
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.560]   to be a part of an event
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.240]   that really there's no downside to.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.320]   You have a chance to be paid more money
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.600]   than you've ever been paid in your life.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.200]   You're selling tickets that are gonna go to charity
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.000]   and it's not behind a paywall.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.560]   So anyone, anywhere in the world can stream this event,
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.120]   watch it and there's no barrier to entry
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.720]   in terms of finances.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.360]   - Was there ever any chance
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.680]   that Gordon Ryan would enter?
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.480]   - I don't think so.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.320]   I don't think so.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.880]   - Is that something you tried?
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.880]   - Me and Gordon don't text each other too often.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.240]   I tag him on Instagram and things,
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.760]   but he doesn't respond.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.360]   - Tell me about your history with Nicholas Maragalli.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.560]   - My history with Nicholas Maragalli,
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.120]   actually it dates back to a time
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.960]   where probably he does not even remember.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.000]   Back when I used to wear a kimono.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.760]   So I went to Abu Dhabi World Pro,
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.520]   I was chasing my gi dreams.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:41.640]   I lost in, I can't even remember.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.000]   Again, probably the final, not me.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.760]   I probably lost in the final against Tommy Langlacher
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.160]   in the weight division.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.720]   This was the last year they did the absolute.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.320]   I went into the absolute.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.280]   I made it all the way to the semis.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.160]   Nicholas Maragalli destroyed me in the gi.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.280]   I did hit a nice little reversal on him though.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.840]   He passed my guard
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.800]   and I somehow reversed him from side control.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.280]   That's the only part of the match I share,
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.080]   after which he swept me, submitted me.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   - You reversed him from side control?
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:08.920]   - Yeah.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.080]   - Okay, so that could be like an instructional.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.280]   - That could, yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.920]   - But the right place, right time though.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.520]   - But then years later, I left the team.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.040]   Maragalli replaced me.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.080]   So they brought in a more credentialed, handsome,
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.840]   doesn't speak as well,
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.640]   but they brought him in, he's my replacement.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.320]   He's coming to the team.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.560]   We face off at ADCC.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.520]   I do a heavier division thinking,
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.360]   I looked at the names and I was like,
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.000]   "That looks like an easy division."
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.520]   And I had two teammates at the time that were in my 88.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.760]   And I was like,
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.680]   "Those guys will have to face off first round.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.320]   "I'll have to face one of them second round."
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.720]   The way they do the seating and the structure of the bracket.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.840]   So I was like, "I'll do 99.
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.120]   "I'll leave 88 for the boys."
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.920]   They both lost my division first round, unfortunately.
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.760]   So I faced off against Maragalli beginning of day two.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.520]   Lot of pressure because Dana has used to corner me,
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.040]   used to be my coach.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.120]   Now he's cornering the Brazilians
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.040]   who we used to complain about as the enemy.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.360]   And I'm like, "What's going on over here?"
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.960]   It's like karate kid stuff.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.120]   I face off against Maragalli.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.760]   I go hard early 'cause I think he can't defend leg locks.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.680]   For the first three minutes,
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.320]   I'm just attacking legs, legs, legs.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.200]   I ended up sweeping him, getting on top.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.400]   No points before the points period,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.360]   but I'm very tired at this point.
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.640]   Maragalli's big.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.720]   There's some guys that get juiced up
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.560]   to hit a certain weight.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.800]   That's what I did to enter this division.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:35.960]   You can't keep your gas tank.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.520]   Maragalli's just a big dude.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.000]   Who knows if he's on the juice or not,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   but he's just naturally sits around 230 pounds or even 225.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.520]   When you're naturally that big,
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.400]   your gas tank's a bit better.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.480]   Again, if you balloon yourself up
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.200]   on every substance possible,
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.200]   gas tank's surprisingly not too good.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.040]   So we have a bit of a close one.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.240]   Decision goes my way.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.200]   Ultimately, finals next, I lose that,
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.560]   but that is sort of our competitive history.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:05.360]   We were meant to have a match
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.600]   that had been pre-booked immediately after ADCC.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.120]   So we agreed to this before ADCC.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.800]   I was like, if the price is right, I'm in.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.640]   So I sign up for it, and I'm thinking ADCC
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.920]   that we're gonna face off soon after.
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:22.520]   Maragalli chose instead to have some vacation time.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.080]   He wanted to go on vacation, he wanted to relax.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.960]   Bit of relaxation down in Brazil.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.280]   So the match is scrapped.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.160]   Flo hit me up, and they say, "Can you do February?"
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.800]   And this was about the time that Vox fought Islam in Perth.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.560]   I was like, "No, I can't do February
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.840]   "because I'll be helping Volkanovsky.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.360]   "That's gonna take precedence over this match."
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.200]   Flo goes, "You know what we'll do?
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.200]   "We'll announce it anyway.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.400]   "We'll sell those tickets anyway.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.320]   "We'll get the people hyped,
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.480]   "and then we'll just have you pull out."
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.520]   And I'm like, "All right, do whatever you want."
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.480]   That's probably not a good idea, but they do that.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.520]   And then people keep trying to rebook this match.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.400]   But now I barely even train anymore.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.320]   I'm busy being a promoter, traveling around.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:10.000]   So now instead of facing them in competition again,
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.400]   which I would do if the price was right,
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.760]   they'd have to pay me very well.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.200]   Two of the shows have offered me the match,
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.720]   but the money, terrible.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.200]   - What do you think is a number that would convince you?
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:24.840]   - It would have to be, I would think, half a million dollars.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.320]   Otherwise I just can't be bothered.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.160]   You know what I mean?
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.000]   It'd have to be worth it.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.760]   Because to put a price on a guy
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.480]   that takes himself as serious as Merigali,
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.200]   Merigali's a very serious man.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.080]   He's talking about authenticity.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.680]   He's talking about words he doesn't even understand.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.560]   For me to give him the opportunity to live in a world
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.360]   where he had won the last match against me,
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.280]   it's hard to put a price on that.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.560]   You know when people say it's not about the money?
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.400]   It's not about the money.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.560]   It's about me waking up every day
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   knowing that he knows he lost to me.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.520]   - So you think you've gotten it in his head?
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.600]   - Yes.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.440]   - How do you think you would do if you were to face him
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.400]   for the said 500,000?
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.360]   - For the 500?
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.760]   - Yeah.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.280]   - I think over five minutes, I beat anyone in the world.
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.920]   - You still think you got it?
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.080]   - I still think I got it.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.760]   Gabby about to find out, so.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:17.600]   - All right, so you're gonna make a statement with Gabby,
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:22.400]   like that it'll be a match she remembers.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.480]   - Yeah, she for sure,
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.600]   I think the fans will remember it as well.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.280]   I'm open to, like if we do this match,
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.800]   I'm taking it very serious,
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.320]   but we'd be open to rematches.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.440]   I've always said I would have a MMA fight with her.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:38.560]   I wouldn't be afraid to hit a big woman.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.160]   - So unlike with Meragali, if you win,
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.800]   you're not gonna ride off to the sunset with Gabby.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.880]   - I'm a bit of a romantic.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.160]   I think she deserves a few finishes, you know?
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.200]   Not one and hit the bed that night.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.440]   - So you think you can actually beat Nicholas Meragali?
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.480]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.880]   I think, I mean, you could throw a riddle at him
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.720]   before the match.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.960]   That'd fucking complicate things for him for the next hour.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.200]   - Will you and Gordon ever get along again?
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.040]   - I think so.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.240]   I think we need, the origins of MDMA
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.480]   was couples therapy in the '70s in Houston, I believe.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.880]   I believe something like that for us
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.080]   could resolve these underlying issues.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.000]   - You're a man of Reddit, 'cause they suggested
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.920]   that you should consider ketamine therapy sessions.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.640]   - Just imagine a therapist sitting down with him.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.320]   They'd be like, "Clear the schedule
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.360]   "for the next couple of weeks."
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.680]   - With all due respect, Greg,
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.560]   I can't imagine a therapist sitting down with you.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.600]   That would be a terrifying-
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.760]   - I do have a therapist, actually.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.360]   They prescribed me Vyvanse.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.600]   He's quite confident in my-
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.560]   - Is this the Metamembali, or what did you-
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.080]   (Gordon laughs)
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.480]   - It's a Russian website.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   - Yeah, it's the old Sean Connery thing.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.640]   It's not a therapist.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.280]   It's just something that's spelled the same.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.520]   - I think me and Gordon, a debate of some type
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.360]   would be awesome.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.440]   - Like a political debate?
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.680]   - Yeah, me representing Kamala Harris,
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.880]   and him representing Donald Trump would be-
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.600]   - So intellectual sparring.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.520]   - An intellectual battle, a battle of wits.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.480]   - Can you just speak to your trolling?
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:09.840]   Is there, underneath it all, is there just a respect,
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.040]   the human beings you go after?
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.960]   - For sure, they have to be worthy of being attacked.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.800]   You know what I mean?
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.400]   If someone attacks, that's the thing.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.880]   It's like, you want a worthy adversary,
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.800]   not in a sense of, I don't wanna battle someone
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.240]   that has better banter than me, 'cause I'm gonna lose,
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.440]   but I wanna battle someone with a profile large enough
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.360]   that it doesn't look like you're just-
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.280]   - Who do you think is the biggest troll
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.920]   or shit talker in martial arts?
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.920]   - Hernado Laranja.
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.720]   - Yeah, well, you can't even put him in the,
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.920]   he's in the other class of human being.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.960]   (Gordon laughs)
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.360]   - He's overqualified.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.040]   - Chael Salonen comes to mind.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:48.880]   - Chael's good.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.000]   - You versus Chael, who's a better shit talker?
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.600]   If you look the entirety of the career.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.960]   - Chael is better.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.880]   I mean, I think if you can shit talk in MMA,
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.520]   'cause there's far worse consequences for you.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.120]   If you're still willing to do it
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.240]   when really violent things can happen to you,
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.480]   I mean, I'm getting death threats,
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:09.080]   but he has a certainty of violence
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:12.040]   against his opponents in MMA.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.280]   - So on Reddit, somebody said,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.920]   you are a Coral Belt level troll
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.560]   and just happened to be good at jujitsu.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.400]   So what did it take for you to rise
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.520]   to the ranks of trolling from White Belt
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.360]   to Black Belt to Coral Belt?
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.400]   What's your journey with talking shit?
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.400]   - That's a good question.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.000]   Hey, I think it would have happened
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.880]   after I moved to America.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.120]   'Cause in Australia, we just, on a daily basis,
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.200]   say some of the worst things you could ever imagine.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.200]   - Like in private life?
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.160]   - Yeah, we're just trying to ruin each other's day.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.960]   - In a way that's so blase, you're going back and forth.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.760]   And the guy that actually gets upset
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.800]   and says some real shit, that's your victory.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.640]   You know what I mean?
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.880]   Like, you're like, oh, we got you.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.280]   You're actually, that actually bothers you.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.280]   All right, we'll take that as a victory.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.280]   - So when you come to America
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.080]   and everybody takes themselves a little too seriously,
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.880]   those are just a bunch of victims
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.240]   that you can take advantage of.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:08.760]   - An Australian entering American banter
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.080]   is like Neo getting his Matrix skills.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.920]   You're just like, whoa, I see everything coming.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.040]   - Do you ever look in the mirror
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.960]   and like regret how hard you went in the paint?
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.800]   At somebody?
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.960]   - I don't think so.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:24.800]   I don't think so.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.840]   - You see you're proud of yourself?
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.520]   - I think what I offer is some balance.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.720]   It's like I'm bringing some justice.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.040]   Ultimately, it'll probably come back in spades to me.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.360]   - Yeah.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.200]   I don't know.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.080]   As a fan of yours, as a fan of Gordon's also,
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.680]   but as a fan of yours, I see the love behind it.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.520]   I don't know.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.840]   It seems always just fun.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.160]   The shit talking seems fun.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.240]   - I wish you'd buy it back.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.840]   It doesn't buy it back anymore, though.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.600]   - What's your relationship like with Mo,
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.080]   the organizer of ADCC?
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.280]   - I mean, it's been a love-hate relationship.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.480]   I guess it's been-- - With Gabby?
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.880]   - Like any good relationship,
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.800]   if you don't get blocked at the end of it,
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.760]   were you really in love to begin with?
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.720]   That's my thoughts anyway.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.680]   So in terms of my friendship with Mo,
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.280]   me and Mo were really close friends for a long time.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.760]   We'd talk a lot.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.080]   He was instrumental in us moving
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.240]   Dana Her Death Squad to Puerto Rico.
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.200]   He lives in Puerto Rico,
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.160]   spends most of his time in Puerto Rico.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:28.440]   I've spent time with him in Florida, California,
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:31.000]   but in terms of our relationship,
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.920]   I'm trying to think of an exact time where it went south,
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.920]   but I guess in my, him being the ADCC organizer,
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.560]   in my attack of athlete compensation was taken personally,
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:52.480]   which is obviously gonna ruin whatever friendship you had.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.400]   - And that started around the time
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.760]   you were thinking about CJI.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.240]   - I mean, to be honest,
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:03.960]   CJI was a result of the response
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.600]   of my discussion of athlete compensation.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.200]   So me and Mo had been close friends,
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.280]   even after the Dana Her team broke up,
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.680]   we were still close friends for quite a while after that.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.240]   But it does complicate things when someone is,
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.600]   for all intents and purposes,
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.280]   as an ADCC competitor,
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.240]   and he runs ADCC, the event, he's in control of it now,
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.280]   he is your boss.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.000]   So that does complicate our friendship.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.960]   - Have you had a conversation since you announced CJI?
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.120]   - Have we had a conversation?
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.280]   - When did you get blocked?
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.280]   - I honestly didn't get blocked, I was just joking.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.680]   (laughs)
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.080]   Honestly, we had a disagreement about athlete compensation.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:49.120]   I said, let's do a podcast and talk about it,
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.120]   because I'm a big fan of transparency.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.480]   If you think I'm an idiot
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.280]   for thinking athletes should get paid more,
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.520]   tell me it, show it to me.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.160]   And I've made public statements,
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.320]   other people have asked why we don't get paid more money.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.720]   You can both tell me and the world at the same time,
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.720]   the grappling world at the same time,
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.360]   but was not interested in doing a podcast.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.600]   Again, maybe he thought I was gonna hit him
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.280]   with some gotcha questions or something,
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.240]   but really at the end of the day,
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.680]   I personally believe you've got nothing to hide.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.760]   If you are confident in the business decisions you've made,
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.080]   then there's no gotcha moment that I could actually do.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.240]   I could easily, I would have done the podcast
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.320]   if I looked like a complete idiot,
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.520]   would have released it anyway,
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.960]   because it would be a good message
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.960]   to where we are in the sport.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.120]   But again, considering what I know
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.200]   about Thomas and Max Price,
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.760]   which I believe we're paying $200,000 for,
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.640]   and T-Mobile's $2 million,
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.680]   how do you justify no increase in athlete pay
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:52.160]   while we have a 1.8 million increase in venue cost?
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.760]   - So you're saying that there could potentially
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:57.080]   be poor business decisions, poor allocation of money
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.600]   that could be reallocated better to support the athletes?
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.880]   - I've never once thought this was some organization
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.520]   where Mo's stealing money for himself.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.760]   I'm just saying that,
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.600]   and again, the road to hell's paved with good intentions,
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.840]   so he might fully think that what he's doing
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.920]   is gonna grow the sport.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.400]   I'm going about it in a completely different way.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.520]   I don't think we need T-Mobile.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.240]   I don't think we need a behind-the-paywall.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.680]   I think we need cheap venue,
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.120]   still maintain good quality production,
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:29.960]   release it for free.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:34.140]   If you want something to grow, present it for free.
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.000]   - Is there a future where the two of you talk?
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:37.840]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.920]   He keeps insisting on talking face-to-face.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.920]   I don't have a problem with that,
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.480]   but my argument is this is a public feud.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.700]   The public, like this is, we're having a disagreement.
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.960]   Let's settle the disagreement
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.440]   in a way that answers the question to the fans,
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:58.920]   because if one of us is a complete idiot,
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:03.040]   then I believe the world of people following this story
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.320]   are entitled to know which one of us is an idiot.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.640]   - If you talk to him, would you be good faith?
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.640]   Like, would you turn the troll down from 11 to like a three?
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.880]   - Yeah, I don't even think I'd need to troll him.
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.680]   I'd just say, "Hey, show us the books."
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.360]   You know what I mean?
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.840]   Honestly, when our event's done,
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.680]   we're gonna be pretty transparent.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.040]   Obviously, we are ran as a nonprofit.
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.320]   We're gonna be pretty transparent about everything.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.840]   And I mean, obviously, ultimately, all the views we get.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.800]   When an event's on Flow Grappling or Fight Pass
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:41.400]   or any other streaming provider, unless it's a pay-per-view,
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:45.260]   you're not gonna know how many people watched.
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:47.240]   So that's one aspect of what we're doing
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:51.440]   is we're gonna have a visual sort of guard
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.760]   to how many people are fans of grappling.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.360]   - Yeah, transparency in all of its forms.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:59.040]   That's what bothers me about the IOC with the Olympics
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.680]   is that there's this organization
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.520]   that puts on an incredible event,
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.960]   but it's completely opaque, it's not transparent.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.560]   And the athletes don't get paid almost at all.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.320]   So it's usually from sponsorships.
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:15.960]   And they sell distribution, broadcast distribution.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.320]   And so like, it's mostly paywalled after the fact.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.280]   It's very, unless you're a super famous athlete
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.080]   or a famous event, it's hard to watch,
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:28.240]   I don't know, the early rounds of the weightlifting
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:31.480]   or the judo or all of the competitions,
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.040]   where most of those athletes get paid almost nothing
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:36.880]   and they've dedicated their whole life.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.520]   Like, they've sacrificed everything to be there.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.080]   And we don't get to watch them openly.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.680]   You can't, in many cases, you can't even pay for it.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.720]   With IOC, I've got to experience this
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.120]   'cause I'll have like podcast conversations
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.240]   with like Judoka, for example.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.160]   And I put like a little clip in a podcast
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:58.840]   and the Olympics channel takes it down immediately.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:03.020]   So they have all the videos uploaded private.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:03.860]   They're private.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.040]   - Oh, to flag the copyright.
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.440]   - They just flag the copyright automatically.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.820]   From the private videos, they could release.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.760]   They could release somewhere, even if it's paywalled,
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.600]   which I'm against, but paywall it,
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.280]   but make it super easily accessible.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:17.400]   So the flow grappling model is still okay.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.880]   I'm against it, but if you do a really good job of it,
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.960]   okay, I can kind of understand a membership fee,
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.400]   but like it should be super easy to use.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.880]   But in the case of the Olympics, first of all,
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.400]   in the case of the Olympics,
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.880]   the whole point of the Olympics
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.480]   is for it to be accessible to everybody.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:37.680]   So paywalling goes against the spirit of the Olympic games.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.160]   And I will say the same is probably true
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.160]   for many sports like grappling,
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:44.120]   especially for major events like ADCC,
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.080]   that I feel like that should be openly accessible
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.640]   to everybody, like on every platform.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.600]   But what was the decision like for you
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:53.800]   to make it accessible on YouTube and X?
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.760]   - Well, I mean, just because basically
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.400]   it's going to grow the sport.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.240]   You know what I mean?
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:03.980]   Like if you have to subscribe to a platform
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:07.400]   to watch something you have a mild interest in,
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.360]   a mild curiosity in, there's a financial barrier there.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.880]   So I wanna open it up because again,
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.920]   we have an investor who's contributing
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.200]   and is happy for it to be spent this way,
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:23.200]   happy for us not to be held hostage
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.480]   by these sort of streaming providers.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.920]   And really like, again, I'm not making accusations
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.520]   against Flow Grappling or UFC Fight Pass.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:33.120]   They are making the right business decision
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:36.000]   by not providing streamer numbers
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.400]   because that's leverage that those people can use
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.040]   against the streaming provider.
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.160]   But for me as an individual athlete
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.000]   that really wants to understand the metrics
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.440]   of how many people actually watch this sport
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.680]   to leverage that in my own sponsorship negotiations,
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.760]   then if I'm in a position to have this out free
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.800]   and also give every athlete involved
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.760]   the same metrics and information,
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.960]   like you will literally be able to see the spikes
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:07.760]   when you compete and you'll be able to take that
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.760]   and present it for opportunities, for sponsorships,
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.120]   for businesses to say, look, look how many views this got.
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.720]   I was one of the most viewed moments of this event.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.160]   So I wanna put the power back in the athlete
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.120]   and take it away from the host.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.320]   - And it creates a lot of incentive
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.120]   for the athlete to make it exciting.
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.480]   - Yeah, this is your time, it might never happen again.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.440]   I fully intend to run this every year, that's the goal.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.480]   But again, it might never happen again.
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:38.160]   - Is there a possible future where the 2026 ADCC
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.760]   is run by Craig Jones?
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.600]   - Could I take over ADCC?
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.840]   I think from an ADCC perspective, it would make a lot of sense.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.920]   I think it would make a lot of sense to wait
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:53.920]   to see if this event turns into Fyre Festival first
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.520]   before you commit to something like that.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:59.280]   But I think a more modern approach
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.240]   to the promotion of the event.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.720]   Again, I keep going back to the comedians.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.560]   You know what I mean?
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.040]   If you want to grow your brand, whatever that may be,
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.640]   provide content for free and you can pay Waller.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.360]   Eventually you can grow the audience,
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.280]   create the audience free.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.040]   You know, I think the, again,
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.440]   if your goal is to create a huge sport here,
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.560]   then it's like, if we're already a niche sport
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.640]   and competition aspect of that, is it even smaller niche,
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.120]   then we need to grow that providing this content
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.360]   for free.
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.400]   - Well, having just chatted with Elon Musk,
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:36.520]   who fundamentally believes that the most entertaining
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.080]   outcome is the most likely, that to me,
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:40.920]   if the universe has a sense of humor,
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.480]   you would certainly, Craig Jones would certainly
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.960]   be running ADCC, which would be, I mean,
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.720]   it would just be like beautifully hilarious.
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.560]   - It would be a poetic ending.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.320]   It'd be a underdog story from a man
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:59.480]   that could never win the event to running the event
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.800]   on behalf of the Sheikh Tahnoon.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:06.640]   - So I saw beating videos of the CGI camp,
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.280]   people training super hard.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:12.640]   So you aside, who don't seem to do things
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:16.440]   in a standard way, what does it take
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:20.040]   to sort of put yourself in a peak shape,
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.880]   peak performance for a huge event like the CGI or the ADCC?
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.480]   - I mean, psychologically, it's really, really brutal.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.280]   Like for me, anytime I'm leading up to any event
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.360]   of any meaningful significance,
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:37.280]   it's horrible on a psychological level
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.640]   because you're always thinking about,
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:39.560]   are you training enough?
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.080]   Are you doing enough?
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:45.240]   If you feel any signs of sickness, injury,
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.080]   the stress levels increase, your sleep quality decreases.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.760]   It's all those little subtle things
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.760]   that are so hard to mitigate.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.480]   So like whether you feel like you're training hard enough,
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.000]   you're overtraining, those to me
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.280]   are the most difficult aspects.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.160]   And I think really those are an individual thing.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.760]   And that's really something where a coach can provide
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.640]   what he thinks to you is the right amount of work.
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.120]   You know, and I think that's different for different people.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.800]   I think Nicky Rod could do eight hours a day.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.640]   You know what I mean?
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.000]   I think Nicky Ryan, eight minutes.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.440]   - I saw a video of Nicky Ryan
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.400]   like with a trash can throwing up.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.240]   - Yes.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.760]   - And the top comment is like,
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.160]   that's him doing the warmup.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:25.200]   (both laughing)
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.200]   - That is satisfying to watch, honestly.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.040]   - Yeah.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.240]   But yeah, so you're supposed to train hard enough
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.520]   to where you have this confidence that you're prepared.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:36.360]   - Yeah.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.400]   I mean, and it's an impossible thing to grasp.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.240]   It's like some of the best performances I've had,
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:44.720]   I've been called up last minute or I've been sick
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:46.480]   or my camp's been horrible.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.840]   And for me personally, I've gone in there and thought,
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:53.280]   relaxed, almost like, oh, well, you know,
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.640]   like you got called up a week ago,
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.040]   you're injured, you missed four weeks of your camp.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:59.880]   And I went in there super relaxed
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.400]   and accepting of the result and performed much better.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.480]   Sometimes when I know three months out,
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.960]   I've got an event coming up
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.880]   and that event only happens every two years.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.280]   It just, the stress of that alone.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.080]   Like I personally, on an individual level,
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:18.680]   more of a, I'd rather wing it.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:19.840]   I'd rather be in the stands
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.520]   and just roll down like Gunner Nelson.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.160]   I remember he had a brilliant performance
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.040]   in an ADCC absolute.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.400]   And he was out drinking the night before.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.880]   He had no idea he was competing the next day.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.640]   He was in the stands eating ice cream
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.400]   and they called his name out for the absolute.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.840]   And he went out there and I believe he got bronze.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.160]   I believe he beat Jeff Munson.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:39.120]   So it's like, it's different for different people.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:41.400]   Obviously you don't want that to be the standard.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.680]   You've got to be putting in the work at all times.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.440]   But even now in my crazy travel schedule
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.600]   where I don't train anywhere near like I used to,
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:54.920]   as long as your game is technical
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:57.280]   and as long as your body's in good condition,
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.400]   I believe you can still train well
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.680]   against world-class guys.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.120]   You might not be able to do an hour straight,
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.920]   but if you're technique-orientated,
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.520]   you're just losing fitness.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.040]   - So is it possible to out-cardio Craig Jones?
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:15.160]   Like is your game fundamentally a technique-based game?
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.360]   - For sure, for sure, yeah.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.400]   I've never wanted to win anything bad enough
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.720]   to train properly for it.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.640]   - Right, but isn't that the secret to your success?
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.680]   Being lazy?
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.720]   - I think so.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.040]   I think that's the only logical explanation.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:29.960]   And I also use it as mind games too.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:34.840]   Again, no one knows whether what I'm saying is true or not.
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.760]   And I'm not saying this story to say anything bad
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.240]   about my opponent at the time,
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:42.800]   but I booked two matches and two consecutive weekends
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.040]   and I've been traveling.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.800]   I think I just got back from one of my trips.
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:51.080]   I've been over in International Snow.
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.800]   I don't even know where the fuck I was, but--
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.040]   - You're in Texas right now, by the way,
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.440]   just in case you forgot.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.280]   - Texas, just for you, just came back for you.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.680]   - Thank you, man, it's an honor.
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:01.440]   - But I hadn't really even trained.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.280]   I couldn't train.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.960]   I was traveling, just had no ability to train.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:08.640]   I trained for like a week, had the Phil Roe match.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.720]   And I said to myself, I was down in Mexico City,
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:13.040]   and I said, you know what?
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.400]   If you win this match,
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.960]   you got to face Lovato next week.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.440]   Don't go out and party.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:21.480]   Don't celebrate the victory.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.200]   But as a 32 year old man at the time
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:26.240]   hitting a flying triangle submission,
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:29.320]   I thought that deemed a worthy after party.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.360]   And we got out of control that night.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:32.680]   And it wasn't until the next day I woke up,
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.520]   I was like, oh, I have Lovato next weekend.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.840]   But people don't know whether I'm telling the truth or not,
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.720]   but it's also, I'm almost too honest
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.040]   because I'll be like doing interviews saying,
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:44.840]   yeah, I was out partying, I barely trained.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.480]   The opponent looks into that and they question it.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.320]   Is he telling the truth?
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.680]   Is he baiting me?
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.280]   Is he really that unconcerned?
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.120]   You know what I mean?
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.040]   It's almost a psychological battle in and of itself,
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.080]   but for the most part, it's true.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.200]   - So to you, being psychologically relaxed
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:01.120]   is extremely important, just not giving a damn.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:02.200]   I wonder what that is.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]   - Not too much pressure.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.840]   I don't want, I don't like the pressure.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.680]   - But you like the pressure
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.680]   when it comes to internet shit talking.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.640]   - I mean, you gotta silently sit back
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:14.400]   and think about a good response, you know?
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.320]   - Yeah.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.680]   How important is it to just go crazy hard rounds
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:22.040]   leading up to competitions like that?
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.600]   You said sort of Nicky Ryan,
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.000]   but on average, for athletes at world-class level,
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.160]   do you have to put in the hard rounds?
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.400]   - Yeah, I think you have to put in the hard rounds.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.600]   Depends at what point in your career you are.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.880]   I think someone like Nicky Ryan
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.000]   might almost train too technically too often.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.320]   And when he comes to competition,
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.400]   it's a confronting experience when someone hits him hard
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.080]   and he feels that pressure.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.520]   So I think different people require different things.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:53.320]   When Nicky Rod is breaking the spine
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.040]   of a 37-year-old father of three bus driver,
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:57.600]   it might be time for him to train
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.360]   in a more technical manner.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.320]   So it's like you gotta cater to what they need.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.520]   And again, depending on the opponent,
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.760]   it's a game of strategy, you know?
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.520]   For me, when I was more active,
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.800]   I look at an opponent that I want,
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.560]   that I could steal some clout from,
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.000]   of which the clout, you can make money.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:14.840]   And I think to myself,
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:17.480]   what's the best rule set I can beat him in?
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:18.480]   That's the strategy.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.080]   And then how would I beat him in that rule set?
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.640]   So there's so many strategic layers
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:26.640]   to go above and beyond just the training for me.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.800]   But nowadays, if I train, short duration, high intensity.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.200]   That's the best for me.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:37.520]   I don't like this six or like 10, six minute rounds,
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.320]   whatever, like I don't like this long training.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.160]   I don't like, for me, it's too much toll on the body.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:47.680]   I think I go to the gym, we bank,
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:49.960]   maybe the first round's slightly light,
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:53.000]   and then just banging out two hard rounds, tops.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.240]   Little bit of problem solving, get out of there.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.280]   'Cause you wanna feel a little bit
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.720]   of the competition intensity.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:02.640]   That feels the best on my body.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.120]   - When you're traveling, you're doing seminars
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.240]   and you're just doing jiu-jitsu with folks,
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.880]   are you training with them?
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.960]   I'm sure there's like, from everything I see,
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.760]   people would love to train with you.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.320]   - Yeah, they wanna, I mean, I don't know what it is.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.320]   Obviously, I guess, it's like people wanna play basketball
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.120]   with like a basketball star or something,
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:25.960]   you know what I mean?
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.360]   But I guess if you played one-on-one with a basketball,
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.520]   there's no great risk of injury.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.920]   You know, that's the real problem,
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.400]   is like if you don't roll at your seminar,
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.240]   the seminar participants don't feel
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:43.400]   like they got the full experience.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.480]   But there's snipers at these seminars,
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.320]   there's these sharks that are circling,
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:50.240]   wanting to attack you.
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.520]   And you have to look at it from both perspectives.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.200]   I think you should provide excellent technique,
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.280]   excellent question and answer time,
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:00.000]   and I think you should roll a little bit.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:00.920]   For the most part, these days,
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:03.320]   I'll just roll 30 minutes straight.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.520]   I'll just do 10 guys, three minutes, no break,
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.160]   30 minutes straight.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.720]   I might even get the guy to pick,
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:11.440]   'cause again, some of these guys come in hot.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.200]   - Yeah, it's terrifying, man,
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.240]   because the thing is, like with Anthony Bourdain,
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.360]   sort of analogy here,
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.880]   like you're exploring all parts of the world,
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.400]   you just wanna be there in the culture,
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.240]   teach good techniques and just socialize.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.240]   You don't wanna like, there's just a bunch of killers
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:31.440]   that are trying to murder you.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:33.360]   - Yeah, to them, they're like,
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.800]   "I get to test myself against a world-class athlete today."
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.080]   And to you, you're like, "Oh, I'm in Odessa.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.240]   "I'd like to get to know the people,
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:45.960]   "try some food, have a couple of drinks,
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:47.040]   "and enjoy the place."
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.720]   But to them, it's time to go.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.880]   You gotta rope it open a bit.
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.200]   If I meet pressure with pressure, I get tired.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:57.560]   But if I don't provide resistance
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.600]   where they think there should be resistance,
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.040]   now it slows their pace down.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.280]   They get shocked a bit.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:06.600]   But 100%, if I'm at a seminar
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.560]   and someone's rolling too hard with me,
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.400]   if I feel like I might get hurt,
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.080]   I will 100% rip a submission on them.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.000]   You know what I mean?
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.360]   Like it's like you're confronted with a threat.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.200]   - Yeah.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.480]   - You have to meet it with a threat.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.000]   It's like, I've spoken about this with Ryan Hall.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.440]   Ryan Hall, give him a warning, and then gone.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.120]   And I think it's perfectly acceptable.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.240]   Like I won't endanger them for no reason.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:34.200]   But if you're coming hot, you better tap fast.
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.720]   If I feel a threat, you better tap.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.120]   I'm not gonna break it for the sake of breaking it.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:43.120]   But if you do some crazy shit
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.120]   that might potentially hurt me,
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.920]   and I get a submission, and I'm tired.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.560]   If you're fresh, you can catch a heel hook,
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:53.480]   hold it tight, the guy tries to wiggle out, you got it.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.680]   If you're tired, and you've been nice with a heel hook,
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:59.680]   and then they slip out and club you in the head,
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.680]   then next time is gonna be the last time.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.560]   - Well, last time, see, you're another level.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.000]   You and Ryan Hall are just world-class.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.840]   But for me, I'm trying to find, navigate through this,
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:15.920]   'cause I'd like to be able to roll 10 rounds for fun,
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.760]   for cultural--
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.520]   - Oh, but they're coming for you, too.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.200]   - And unfortunately, ripping submissions
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:25.600]   or knee-on-belly some kind of dominant position,
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.520]   people don't hear the message at all.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:31.280]   Or if I let them submit me a bunch of times,
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:34.000]   they don't calm down, either.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.440]   So I've been trying to figure out how to solve that puzzle,
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.800]   'cause I'd like to keep rolling with people
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.200]   across the world for many more years to come.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.040]   But it's tough.
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:44.880]   - You can't do it.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.480]   If you've reached any level of notoriety,
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.700]   whether it's in the sport or just as a celebrity,
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:53.320]   you're better off to just have three, four
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:56.120]   trusted training partners and train privately.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:57.780]   That's the sad situation.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.840]   People used to say, "Oh, you could be such and such
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:02.080]   "a good anti-gym nut."
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.120]   Those days are over now.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:08.220]   Now, if you show up and you have any sort of name,
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:09.240]   they're coming to kill.
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:11.160]   You're better, honestly, you're better off.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.160]   It's so much safer.
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:16.240]   Training is about trusting.
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.480]   Trust is built from safe rounds.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.020]   - Strangers are scary.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:22.860]   - I don't know.
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:25.180]   I'm trying to develop a radar when I look at a person,
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:27.740]   trying to figure out, are they--
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.580]   - Are they from Eastern Europe?
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.940]   I'll tell you what, the most dank--
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.760]   - Yeah.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:33.600]   - That's a good one.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.440]   You know what?
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.620]   Anyone that wears a Pitbull sports rash guard
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:40.380]   or anyone from the country of Poland, be ready.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.780]   - Oh, Polish people go hard.
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:42.900]   - People go hard.
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:45.900]   I've never had a flow roll with a Polish person.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:46.980]   - Somebody on Reddit asked,
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:49.940]   "How many legs did you break in Eastern Europe?"
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:50.880]   - Three or four.
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.740]   - To send a message
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:54.860]   or just for your own personal enjoyment?
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:55.980]   - I don't enjoy it.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:57.420]   You know, they--
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:58.600]   - You don't enjoy the violence.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.380]   - It is humorous after the fact, though,
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:02.260]   because, I mean, it's just like, hey,
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:05.620]   like, bro, I'm jet lagged, I'm tired,
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:07.420]   I'm here for you guys.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.180]   Why are you trying to hurt me?
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:11.860]   You know, like, if I get a submission,
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:14.100]   tap, don't hesitate at all.
[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:14.980]   Don't hesitate, you know?
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:16.540]   Like, it's like, it's, I mean,
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:17.820]   you just see it's dangerous.
[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:19.420]   It's a dangerous thing.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:21.100]   And when strangers going crazy,
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:21.920]   it's their show.
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:23.620]   They think they're getting invites to the CJI
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:24.460]   if they tap me.
[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:26.340]   It's just wild.
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:30.880]   - So, speaking of which, just for the hobbyist,
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.380]   for a person just starting out,
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:34.640]   what wisdom can you provide?
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.260]   Like, say you were tasked with coaching a beginner,
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.680]   a hobbyist beginner,
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:45.440]   how would you help them become good in a year?
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.240]   What would be the training regimen?
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.080]   What would be their approach,
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.440]   mental, physical, in terms of practice to Jitsu?
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.440]   - I mean, honestly, pick and save training partners
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:58.120]   and trying to understand the positions
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.600]   and not just freaking out.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.640]   Like, you might escape if you freak out,
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:04.640]   but you also might be stuck in something
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:05.900]   and you injure yourself.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:08.620]   So it's like, I think if you can,
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:10.360]   it's just about longevity.
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:15.360]   You know, like, if you can find a pace to train at,
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:19.240]   and like sort of intensity and the right people,
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:22.300]   you could potentially train five years without injury.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:25.320]   It's really about how you move.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:28.120]   If you are always moving in an explosive way,
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.200]   eventually you're gonna do that from a position
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.000]   in which you can't move and then someone's gonna tear.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.560]   And you also wanna be able to trust training partners
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.700]   to not go too crazy, inflict too much pain.
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:41.540]   You know what I mean?
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:44.960]   It's like, yeah, I think I've managed
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:48.480]   to avoid a lot of injuries 'cause I just never roll
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:52.200]   too athletically, explosively.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.400]   I think I'm probably incapable
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.600]   of moving at that rate of speed.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.800]   - So that's part of it is you, the way you move,
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:00.400]   but I guess you also don't allow anybody
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.080]   to put you in a really bad position in terms of hurting you.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.360]   - I let 'em put me in a bad position,
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.560]   but I try to stay relaxed at all times.
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:10.000]   You know, that's the key here is like,
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.560]   I mean, yeah, obviously you got the cheesy keep it playful,
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:19.560]   but it's like, if you can remain calm in bad positions,
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.560]   that is a skill.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.720]   That's your confidence, not in yourself,
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.840]   but that the other guy's incapable of submitting you.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:25.960]   That's the ultimate confidence.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.120]   You can give 'em whatever you want.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.480]   - So the thing you want as a beginner
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:32.400]   is to focus on minimizing injury by relaxing,
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.440]   by not going, by not freaking out.
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:35.280]   - Yes, keeping it at a pace
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:37.480]   so you can understand what just happened.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.040]   - The thing is, like, how do you know
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.160]   if you're freaking out or not as a beginner?
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:42.080]   It feels like a--
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.600]   - If you're panicking.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.960]   - Yeah, if you're, that's a good,
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:48.240]   if you're, I mean, I see a lot of beginners
[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.880]   kind of breathing, starting to breathe hard.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.360]   They tense up.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.000]   That's probably, underneath that is panic.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.840]   - Yeah, if you can make someone panic,
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:55.680]   you will fatigue them.
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:57.600]   It's the same, it's like if you're,
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.200]   even if you're higher level
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.480]   and you're worried about getting your guard passed,
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.240]   it's the panic that leads to fatigue
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.280]   in your guard retention.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:08.400]   But if you're so flexible, you remain calm,
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.880]   I think it's 'cause you're not panicked.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.720]   - Fear is the mind killer.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:16.240]   But also, you have one of the more innovative games
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:19.120]   in jiu-jitsu history.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:20.520]   How'd you develop that?
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:23.520]   How do you continue throughout your career?
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.000]   How are you innovating?
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.280]   What was your approach to learning
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.240]   and figuring positions out, figuring submissions out?
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.960]   - I mean, financial motivation.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.040]   If you can hit moves that no one else knows how to do,
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.120]   you can sell those instructionals.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:38.760]   But also, it keeps it interesting
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:42.240]   'cause it's like, I mean, it can get stagnant and boring,
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:45.280]   you know, like a lot of people get to blue belt,
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.640]   they're good at one thing, they only do that one thing.
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.720]   I think it's finding creative ways to beat people.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.000]   And sometimes, creativity is in how they respond to it.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.400]   So if you can find a humiliating move to do to someone,
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.600]   well, not even necessarily humiliating,
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.400]   but a move that is unexpected.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.680]   When you get hit with something you don't expect,
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:06.440]   I think that is sort of really
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.400]   one of the most fun aspects of it, you know what I mean?
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.720]   Like, you train to stay better
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.720]   than the people you're better than.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.280]   That's what keeps you in the game.
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:17.760]   And finding creative ways to beat those people
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:19.360]   is some of the most entertainment.
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.660]   - So that's just something that brings you joy
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:24.720]   is by doing the unexpected.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:26.000]   - Yeah, trying to, if you get swept
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.520]   with something that you don't think should work,
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.640]   I think that's fulfillment.
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:35.320]   - So your game is even a bit trolly, interesting.
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:37.440]   So like, but what's the actual process of like,
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:38.360]   like with the Z-Guard,
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.080]   all the innovative stuff you've done there?
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.400]   How do you come up with ideas there?
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.440]   - I mean, just studying tape.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:46.320]   Just study tape and try to reverse engineer.
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:49.680]   Like if I see something or I train with someone
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:53.160]   and it feels, you know when you have those moments
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.000]   where you're like, oh,
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.100]   I don't even know what they're doing here.
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:57.840]   And if you can put someone in a position
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.860]   they don't understand, that's also where they panic.
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:03.800]   So it's like creating different ways to make people panic.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.360]   But also, I mean, just innovation, like having fun with it.
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:09.200]   You know, like I guess the artistic aspect of it
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:12.960]   is fun, you can be creative in how you can beat people.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.200]   - Did you say artistic or autistic?
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:16.040]   - Both.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:16.860]   - Okay. - Both.
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:17.700]   - Just checking.
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:22.280]   What's like the most innovative thing you've come up with?
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:23.980]   What's like some of the cooler ideas
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:25.280]   you've come up with on the mat?
[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.120]   - I don't think I've come up with anything,
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:29.560]   but I've popularized things, you know,
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.800]   like certain styles of leg entry.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:35.640]   I definitely didn't invent them, but I popularized them.
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:39.360]   Octopus Guard, playing more from Turtle,
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.760]   sort of the pinning style of game.
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:44.160]   Like as a, because of my jokes online,
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.960]   put me in a position of power in the sport
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:48.920]   so that when I post content, it can popularize a move
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:51.720]   or release an instruction or popularize a game.
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:54.440]   But it's still, I'm not trying to sell inauthentic products.
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:58.820]   I'm still, I want the technique to work, be functional.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:03.000]   - But put some humor on top of it, like Power Bottom,
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.640]   their instructional names are pretty good.
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:06.960]   And you changed that one, I saw the name of that.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.200]   - Oh, I mean, unfortunately, Meta, the ads,
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:13.160]   were not appreciating some of that humor.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.480]   So we had to soften the titles a bit.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:18.700]   - You got a phone call from the man, said, "Change this."
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:19.540]   - I didn't.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:22.160]   Allegedly, the company hosting it did.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:23.000]   (laughing)
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.640]   - Right, right.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.520]   What do you think about Zuck in general?
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:29.440]   Like the fact that he trains Jiu Jitsu.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.600]   Have you got a chance to train with him?
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:32.040]   'Cause you've trained with Volk.
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:32.880]   - I haven't trained with him.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:35.960]   I met him when Volk's fought earlier.
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.360]   We've spoken briefly.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.800]   Interesting guy, for sure.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:43.200]   Loves Jiu Jitsu, loves MMA.
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:47.360]   He's really intending to compete in something, I think.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:50.240]   - Competed in Jiu Jitsu, intends to compete in MMA.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.800]   Has a beginner's mind, is humble about it.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.640]   Interesting.
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:56.720]   Was he ever in consideration for CGI as a--
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.400]   - Oh, I mean, we would love to have him.
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:00.360]   We'd love to have him.
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.480]   But he is coming off of ACL surgery.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.680]   I think his return to sport is August.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:06.320]   So I think he'll be back training again soon.
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:07.520]   - Yeah.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:11.800]   What's your relationship has been like with Volkanovsky?
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.520]   Like what have you learned about martial arts,
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.400]   about grappling, and different domains,
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.040]   just training with him?
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:18.080]   - I mean, for me personally,
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:21.880]   what's so interesting about Volkanovsky is his,
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.400]   I guess where he came from, you know?
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:27.280]   Like it's like you have pre-existing ideas
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:29.840]   of what a UFC champion is.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:30.920]   Again, I would say it's similar
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.960]   to when I started training Jiu Jitsu
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.280]   and I first traveled to America
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:36.240]   and got to train with some really famous people.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:39.240]   You realize how relatable they are in some aspects.
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.160]   Volkanovsky trains a freestyle,
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:45.520]   and it is humble beginnings, humble origins.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:50.240]   Like it's a small gym in a small sort of beach side city.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.320]   They're running puzzle mats, you know what I mean?
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.960]   When you think UFC champion,
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:56.920]   you don't think puzzle mat gym, you know what I mean?
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.360]   Like he's not training at a American top team.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.760]   He's not at one of these big gyms.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:05.760]   So to me, it just shows what you're capable of
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:09.840]   through hard work and sort of self-educating
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.000]   in such an isolated place.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.040]   It's insane to me that he's still considered
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.240]   probably the pound for pound best featherweight ever,
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:18.440]   in my opinion.
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.920]   And he's basically come across and started late
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.720]   from a rugby background.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.960]   But also in terms of what I've learned,
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:27.800]   on a technical level, I've picked up a lot of stuff
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:29.800]   from him in sort of grappling exchanges,
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.640]   how to get back up, obviously wall wrestling.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.760]   In terms of how hard he trains,
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:40.000]   how hard he works the cardio aspect is insane.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.600]   His cardio workouts are absolutely insane.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.040]   - So he's the opposite of you.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:48.720]   - Complete opposite of me, probably publicly and privately.
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:51.280]   As an athlete, yeah.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.840]   The amount of work he puts in
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:56.200]   and just his sheer sort of mental willpower.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:57.520]   I remember there's been a couple of times
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.880]   where I've watched him do weight cuts
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:01.040]   where like, that's horrible.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.400]   You're watching your friend.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.880]   You know, obviously we started as like,
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:07.320]   basically I would help him in certain jujitsu aspects
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.320]   and then becomes a close friend of yours.
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.200]   But the whole process of the MMA fight is horrible,
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:17.680]   especially when you care about the person fighting
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:21.440]   because some of those weight cuts you see are awful.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:23.400]   Like you're basically seeing guys eyes roll back
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.960]   in their head, like him just powering through
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:30.160]   a five kilo, 10 pound cut.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.480]   And just constantly talking about how easy it is.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.000]   But while clearly, I mean,
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.600]   these guys look like they're dying.
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.440]   You know, like to push through that
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:41.560]   and then to push through some of the moments in his fight.
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:44.240]   To watch him be completely relaxed
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:47.120]   until like five minutes before the fight.
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.080]   And then he starts talking about,
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.160]   you're never gonna take this belt away from my family.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:52.280]   Like he's singing about his family
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:54.280]   before he fights his kids.
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:56.480]   You know, you see the character change.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.320]   It's just absolutely insane to watch.
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:01.640]   On the other side of that is obviously watching
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.560]   the ups and downs.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.160]   There's been so many ups.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:07.680]   The last two have been downs.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:11.760]   So you see in the full spectrum of the highest highs
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.000]   and the lowest lows.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.160]   - How's he able to deal psychologically with loss?
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.000]   - I don't know.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.960]   Obviously he's still hungry, still motivated.
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:21.200]   Obviously I thrive in a losing environment,
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:25.960]   but him on the other hand, I'm not sure.
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.800]   We don't talk too much on that level.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.120]   Obviously we check in his friends,
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.840]   see what he's up to, see what he's planning.
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:34.920]   We were trying to get him a grappling match at CJR.
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:37.960]   I won't say the reasons it fell through,
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:42.960]   but we were setting one up with Mikey Musumichi,
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.360]   but we couldn't get it done.
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:47.680]   - And you can't say the reasons why.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.360]   - I can't say the reasons, but it would have been awesome.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.480]   - Do you think you could have set that up
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:51.360]   if you had more time?
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:54.560]   Like set something, like part of the challenge here
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.960]   is for some of these gigantic match-ups.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.320]   I feel like it takes time.
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:02.440]   - Yeah, that, being the promoter.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.760]   Tournament, not as bad.
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:08.000]   The super fights, really, really difficult.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.600]   I don't think we could have set it up with more time,
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.640]   that particular match, but that was the dream.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.200]   That's what we were hoping to do.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.880]   - But there's a lot of other interesting match-ups
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.840]   that you could have possibly gotten through
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:19.000]   if there's more time.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.600]   - Yeah, I'd love to see, I mean, personally,
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.840]   I really want to see Volks and Ortega
[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:25.040]   have an actual grappling match.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:27.680]   'Cause we saw him get out of those deep submissions
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.120]   and apply a ton of ground and power.
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.800]   I'd love to see him just have a grappling match.
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.280]   I'd love to see more of the UFC stars
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.120]   have grappling matches,
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:37.920]   especially if they've had any head trauma in a fight.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:40.280]   It's like, hey, let's keep them busy.
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:42.600]   'Cause as you see, some of those guys go crazy
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:43.760]   if they can't train.
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:46.640]   - What about the fights against Makachev?
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:48.160]   You think Volk can beat him?
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:50.280]   - I think the first fight showed he could beat him,
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:52.280]   for sure, showed it's possible.
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:53.520]   Even in the second fight,
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.840]   when he reversed the grappling exchange,
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:58.720]   I wish he'd tried to take Makachev down.
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:02.640]   I really think he has a huge strength advantage
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:03.520]   against Makachev.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.640]   And I personally believe he has a fence wrestling advantage.
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:11.640]   You might not see it in a sense of the technical hip tosses
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:14.920]   and things like that, like really,
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:17.160]   but I do believe Volk's one of the best,
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:19.800]   if not the best cage wrestler in the world.
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:21.760]   - Who do you think wins in a grappling match?
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.040]   - That would be interesting, be interesting.
[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.000]   The problem is almost to,
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.440]   while you are a champion like Islam is,
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:31.320]   you could just never book him.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:32.520]   You could never get it.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:34.800]   - What do you think makes the Dagestani wrestlers
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.600]   and fighters so good?
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.960]   - I mean, I think personally, those guys are just like,
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.320]   they just love it.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.400]   It's just about like, it's how they train.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.760]   It's a fight to the death.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.600]   You know what I mean?
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:48.960]   It's just built in them.
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:51.280]   They don't wanna concede an inch ever.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.680]   I think for MMA and wrestling,
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:55.680]   that can be very, very good.
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:57.560]   I think sometimes when those guys come over
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.440]   to Jiu-Jitsu specific events,
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.280]   they get leg locked, they fall into traps,
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.400]   overly aggressive or overly evasive.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:06.680]   But I think the way they train just is perfect for a fight.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.640]   A fight that can just forward pressure,
[02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:12.280]   eat some shots, grind a guy against the wall.
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:15.400]   Fence wrestling is technical.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.520]   Jiu-Jitsu is far more technical.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:19.680]   There's way more things you can do
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:21.800]   in a grappling scenario from top and bottom
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:23.320]   than I think against the wall.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.320]   So a grinding nature of how they train
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:28.840]   works really good to walk a guy down
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.680]   and take him down against the wall.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.240]   And then obviously with ground and pound,
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:35.160]   very good to hold a guy down.
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:38.200]   So I think just never conceding an inch in training,
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:42.120]   it's just they've done that since they were born basically.
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:44.120]   - So you learn how to grind somebody down.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.640]   - Yeah, like they're just trying to break each other
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:48.920]   at all times, trying to have some dominance
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.680]   over their friends and who they train with.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:54.440]   - But you think in the grappling context
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.600]   that will not always translate?
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.880]   - Not when you can pull guard and submit from your back.
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:04.000]   I think that sort of negates some of that grinding pressure.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.040]   I think that has to be met
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:09.640]   with more slow technical lateral movement.
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.120]   I think that's the way you,
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.920]   like that would be the dream for me
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:15.800]   is a guy just comes straight forward into my guard.
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:18.400]   So that grinding approach works well
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:21.720]   if he's taken me down and got already close to me.
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:24.240]   But if I'm laying flat on my back and he's standing
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:29.240]   and he has to engage, he has all that danger at range.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:32.880]   But if he can connect to my body before we go down,
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.720]   now we're in his world again, I think.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:36.120]   - I wonder if it's like,
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:39.760]   Edis Prime could be versus you, for example.
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.680]   Who do you think wins there?
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:41.720]   - Buggy Choke for sure.
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.880]   - Buggy Choke, no way.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:45.000]   I know you're joking.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.640]   - We get him with a buggy, I reckon.
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:48.760]   - Really?
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:52.920]   So you can get the Buggy Choke at the highest level?
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:53.760]   Can you educate me on that?
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.880]   Like if that legitimately can work at the highest level?
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:58.720]   - Buggy Choke for sure, yeah.
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:00.240]   - Really? - You can catch anyone.
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:01.840]   - Really, okay.
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:03.320]   - You're not a buggy believer.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.880]   - I'm not a buggy hater either, I'm just...
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:11.640]   I'm agnostic on the Buggy Choke.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:13.440]   - Khabib would go to sleep for sure.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.280]   - Yeah?
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.920]   - Yeah, there's no way he would tap to a Buggy Choke.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.760]   I try, who was it I faced recently?
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.720]   I faced a Russian guy from Tatar.
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:22.000]   I couldn't buggy him.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.400]   I was trying the close guard one though,
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.160]   sort of like a, it is harder to pull off.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:28.560]   But he would, I had to put him to sleep twice
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:29.840]   at the end of the match with a triangle,
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.760]   but he was just willing.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.640]   Like, I don't know, Eastern European guys,
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.880]   it's like, they're treating it like a real fight, you know?
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:42.200]   - Have you ever gone hard with a Dagestani person?
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:45.080]   Like grappling, wrestling?
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.840]   Any of the fighters on any of the MMA guys?
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:49.960]   - Have I, have I, have I?
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:51.200]   I mean, they do train hard.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.040]   They do train hard.
[02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.840]   When I did the seminar in Odessa,
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:56.080]   it was at a school, but another school in the city
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.440]   brought like 10 Dagestani guys.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:02.120]   All of them went insanely hard.
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.960]   I was like, guys, let's...
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:04.800]   - Okay.
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:07.120]   - I was like, it's a small sample size,
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.920]   but they all wanted to be broken.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:12.680]   - What do you think, you as the wise sage of Jiu-Jitsu,
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:14.360]   if you look 10, 20 years out,
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.560]   how do you think the game is gonna evolve?
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:17.640]   The art of it.
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.600]   - The art of it.
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:22.480]   I mean, I think obviously people are gonna keep innovating,
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:26.040]   perfecting certain things, throwing out information,
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.400]   bad sort of techniques, bad sort of...
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.400]   But I mean, it's so hard to predict.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:31.960]   It's like, that's the game of making money
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:35.160]   with the instructionals, is predicting where we go next.
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:36.480]   It's so, so difficult.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:38.160]   - What do you think is gonna be the most popular
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.400]   submissions on CGI and ADCC this year?
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:43.160]   Is it gonna be footlocks or rear naked?
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.640]   - I think, actually CGI,
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:49.400]   I think there's gonna be a lot of guys that don't tap,
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:50.720]   that take injuries.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:53.440]   A small concern is that a guy wins the match,
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:58.440]   but he's so injured, he can barely go on to the next match.
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:04:59.880]   Win the battle, lose the war.
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:02.120]   - We are gonna see that, aren't we?
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.480]   People refusing to tap.
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.200]   - We actually, we did the walkthrough yesterday
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:07.600]   and we were like, one ambulance is not enough.
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.160]   Get a second one here.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:10.280]   - Yeah.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:13.440]   - 'Cause if they take one guy injured to hospital,
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:16.480]   we can't continue until an ambulance comes back.
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:18.400]   So these guys are gonna go...
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:20.440]   Everyone will be Dagestani for a day.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:21.280]   - Yeah.
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.720]   - That's what I think this tournament will achieve.
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:26.600]   But progression, it'll just be the integration
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:29.200]   of wrestling into jujitsu.
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:31.280]   You know, I think that would be the most exciting
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:32.480]   way the sport could progress,
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.560]   is basically folk style wrestling,
[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:36.960]   but an integration of submissions
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:39.000]   from the standing position too.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.280]   If you just follow the rules of,
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:43.280]   you should always be fighting to get on top,
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:45.120]   whether that's a submission that leads
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.480]   to a sweep or a sweep,
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:50.880]   and you should be trying to avoid being pinned.
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:53.600]   And as long as the game revolves around that
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:56.640]   and guys engage each other offensively on the feet,
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:01.640]   that would be the most exciting, best way to watch the sport.
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:04.000]   - Yeah, when I show the sport of jujitsu,
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.160]   the most exciting stuff is whenever both people
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:10.160]   wanna be wrestling, scrambling wrestling,
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:11.520]   they both wanna get on top.
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:12.360]   - Yeah, the scramble.
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:15.520]   - That looks like fighting versus guard stuff.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.640]   - I'm a guy that totally agrees with you,
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:19.120]   but if I think the guy's a better wrestler,
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:20.520]   I will concede, you know?
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:23.200]   Like, it's like, that's the hard part.
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:26.800]   - But then the whole crowd will then mock you ceaselessly,
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.080]   as they should, for conceding.
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:30.000]   - That's what the million should be.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.840]   We should have a tournament or a round-robin thing
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:35.320]   where it's like, the million goes to the most exciting man.
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:36.160]   - Yeah.
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:37.280]   - That's a dangerous risk.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.840]   - I mean, in a way, that's what's gonna happen
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:40.880]   because this is quite open.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.720]   So the benefit of being exciting is you're going to be
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.480]   glorified on social media.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:49.040]   And if you're going to be boring and stall,
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:52.160]   you're going to be endlessly sort of willified.
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:53.680]   - And forget about medals.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:56.480]   Social media glory is all that matters.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:59.320]   - Well, in a certain sense, on a basic human level, yeah.
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:02.880]   I mean, not all that matters, but it's...
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.360]   You're not gonna, if you're gonna stall,
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.280]   you're gonna become a meme, I feel like.
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:07.960]   Especially with CGI.
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:11.280]   And so, are the refs gonna try to stop stalling?
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:13.040]   - Yeah, we're gonna penalize 'em hard.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:14.400]   Hit 'em hard.
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:16.520]   Get that boring shit out of here.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:18.920]   - So what percentage of athletes would you say
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:20.000]   are on steroids?
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.520]   Is it 100%?
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.680]   - Anyone that's ever beaten me.
[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:25.520]   - Okay.
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.840]   - They're taking more steroids than me.
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:28.680]   I don't know.
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:31.840]   I wanted to test them, but not to do anything bad,
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:33.280]   but just in the name of science,
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:36.000]   to see what people are running.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.360]   It's so hard to say, 'cause you train with people,
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.520]   and they don't even tell you what they're on.
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.400]   I tell the world what I'm on, and they go, "Look at you.
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:44.600]   "You're not taking any steroids."
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:47.960]   That's like, it's such a secret, secret thing.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:52.040]   I personally think it's almost impossible to say.
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:54.520]   But occasionally, you look at a guy,
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:56.280]   and you're pretty certain, you know?
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:57.880]   - Yeah, it looks so.
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:59.680]   But you could also go the other way.
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:02.360]   Certain people are just genetically built,
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.560]   and they look like they are,
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:07.000]   and then there's probably others, like yourself.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.760]   - It's a self-defense mechanism,
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:11.880]   'cause you'd rather assume that that guy was on steroids
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:15.420]   than his genetics are so far superior to yours.
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:19.440]   You're like, "Nah, it must be steroids."
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.560]   - Yeah, that's the part of accusations
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.000]   of people being on steroids that I hate.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.640]   It's like, without data, people are just like,
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:29.200]   it's a way they can say that somebody's cheating
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.920]   without, 'cause I like celebrating people.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:33.680]   And sometimes, people aren't on steroids,
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.320]   and they aren't cheating, and they're just fucking good.
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:37.560]   - What about Gabi Garcia?
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:41.960]   - I think she's beautiful, strong,
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:45.440]   and you're a lucky man to share the mat with her.
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:47.120]   You should be honored.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:50.880]   And I'm betting a huge amount of money on her, so.
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:51.720]   - Me too.
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:54.720]   - Either way, you're gonna get paid.
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:56.440]   - She's paying 11 to one.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:59.680]   - I bet on love as well, so we are aligned in that way.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.920]   - Love will prevail.
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:02.720]   - Okay, you put Alex Nils to sleep.
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:06.880]   Just to reflect back on that.
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:09.100]   (laughs)
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:09.940]   What was--
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:11.600]   - He was too woke, he needed it.
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.240]   - So that's you fighting the woke mind virus or whatever?
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:15.720]   - I think it was on the pulse too much.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:16.560]   - What was that like?
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:20.400]   I didn't see the full video, I just saw a little clip.
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:21.680]   - I thought he was dead for a second,
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:24.160]   but I, for some strange reason, couldn't stop laughing.
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:25.000]   - Yeah.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.640]   - I was like, "Please wake up."
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:28.760]   - There's something funny about it, yeah.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.120]   - I was like, "His blood pressure's higher than mine,
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:32.160]   "I hope that didn't cook him."
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.280]   - Yeah, that would be quite sad.
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:35.280]   - It's so crazy, he's--
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:36.160]   - To murder somebody.
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:37.360]   - Yeah.
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:42.080]   He's probably the most just entertaining human being ever,
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:45.480]   off like just, he just says the crate like,
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:48.160]   off air, he's always on.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:50.120]   It's like, that's just,
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:52.880]   he's always ready to say some wild shit.
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.720]   - The craziest shit possible.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:56.520]   What's it like going to sleep?
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:58.800]   I somehow have never gone to sleep.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.600]   - I went to sleep one time,
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:02.400]   Lachlan Giles was demonstrating a technique on me,
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:03.720]   but I woke up straight away.
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.600]   But for 10 seconds, I didn't know who I was,
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:06.640]   where I was, what I was doing.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:07.960]   But that's it, that's the only time I went out.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.520]   - Disorienting.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.360]   - Didn't feel good though.
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:12.760]   Some people say it feels good, it did not feel good.
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:15.240]   - 'Cause you were like, what, panicked, lost?
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:17.480]   - Yeah, I just didn't know what was going on.
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:18.320]   - Yeah.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:20.320]   And then you load that in, that must be a cool feeling,
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:22.800]   to load it all back in, like realize, where am I?
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:24.440]   I feel like that sometimes in a hotel,
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.520]   when I'm traveling.
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:26.680]   It's like, where the fuck am I again?
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:29.520]   When you wake up, maybe that's what it's like.
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:32.360]   - Some people push it too far, David Carradine.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:33.200]   - What?
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.040]   What?
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.100]   (laughing)
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:37.320]   I'm too dumb to get that joke.
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:38.720]   (laughing)
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:40.880]   - Auto-erotic asphyxiation.
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:42.720]   - Oh, good, thank you.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:43.880]   Thank you, now I know.
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.560]   So, given all the places you've gone,
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:50.040]   all the people you've seen recently,
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:52.520]   what gives you hope about this whole thing we got going on?
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:55.100]   About humanity, about this world?
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.680]   We start war sometimes,
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:00.760]   we do horrible things to each other sometimes.
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:01.720]   Wow.
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:04.040]   Amidst all that, what gives you hope?
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:06.840]   - That you can still make fun of anything,
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:07.980]   as long as it's funny.
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:11.680]   That's what I'm fighting for.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:12.800]   People talk about cancel culture,
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:14.920]   I just think the joke wasn't funny enough.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:17.120]   (laughing)
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:18.180]   Had poor delivery.
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:21.480]   - Well, thank you for being at the forefront
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:24.120]   of making fun of everything and anything.
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:25.640]   And thank you for talking today, brother.
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:26.540]   - Thank you, bro.
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:29.240]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation

[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:36.920]   from Anthony Bourdain.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.800]   Travel changes you.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:42.160]   As you move through this life and this world,
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.560]   you change things slightly.
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:46.880]   You leave marks behind, however small.
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.380]   And in return, life and travel leaves marks on you.
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:53.920]   Thank you for listening.
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:55.720]   I hope to see you next time.
[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:58.300]   (upbeat music)
[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:00.880]   (upbeat music)
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:10.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
