[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Why should people care about solving this problem?
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.440]   - If you're breathing improperly,
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.520]   you are denying yourself oxygen,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.520]   so it makes it harder for your body to process oxygen.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.560]   You are making your heart work harder,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.800]   which leads to hypertension, other issues.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.680]   You are making it harder for your brain to focus
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.400]   and to make decisions.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.160]   You are increasing your chances
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.120]   of having respiratory disorders.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.800]   You are increasing your chances of having anxiety and panic.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.680]   I can keep going, let me keep going.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.600]   So it's a disaster for your health.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   If you were to eat bad food,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.080]   it's very bad for your health, right?
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.520]   That's very obvious.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.080]   If you sleep poorly, it's bad for your health, right?
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.040]   But people don't realize that if you breathe poorly,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.960]   if you are constantly suffering
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.720]   from even a slight dysfunction in your breathing,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.240]   it's going to impact you,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.640]   and it impacts you in so many different ways.
