[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.080]   We got a question here from John.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.160]   John asks, "What does your general knowledge management look like these days?"
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   John, that's a good question because I've been thinking about this recently.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.640]   So here's what happened.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.600]   A listener mailed me a book, "How to Take Smart Notes."
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.400]   Now, this book is about four or five years old now, but it's already an
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.640]   underground classic because it really helped introduce to a broader and
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.320]   English-speaking audience this Zettelkasten note-taking system.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.080]   Now, I knew a little bit about this.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.400]   I've talked about it on the show.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.200]   We've had some guests on the show, like Srini Rao, who swears by it and
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.400]   talked a little bit about it, but I wasn't really deep into the details.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.480]   So I read this book recently.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.880]   This is actually one of my five books for January that I'm reading.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.960]   And it was interesting.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.480]   It was interesting.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.080]   So here's the foundational premise of this book, the narrative motivation
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.000]   for this book, is that there was a sociologist, he was German, his name
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.280]   was Luhmann, and he came to sociology late.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   And the idea was, it's too late for you to get a dissertation and become a
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   sociologist, it's kind of late in life, I don't think it's going to work out.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.360]   And he did, he got his dissertation like that and became incredibly
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.600]   productive as an author.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.880]   All right.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.160]   So then there was a team from some German university that studied this guy, Luhmann.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.320]   How was he so productive?
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.720]   How did he get his dissertation so fast?
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.160]   But also, how did he publish all of these epic papers, this huge quantity
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.880]   of epic papers throughout his lifetime?
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.440]   This is the story that's told in this book.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.800]   And what they discovered is he had a crazy note-taking system, the Zettelkasten
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.360]   system, and it was built around what's called a slip box.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.680]   And I'm not going to get into all the details now, but it's a box in which
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   you put these slips of paper on which you have notes.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.080]   And the way it works is when you're taking notes on a particular topic,
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.400]   you put that, first of all, you take the notes kind of standalone, like you
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.680]   think about it before you take the notes.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   The thinking is happening when you take the notes, right?
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.360]   You're not transcribing, you're taking notes.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   You try to put it behind an existing relevant note in your box, in the slip
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.960]   box, or a box full of slips.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.760]   And then you can also link.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.920]   So these are numbered, and so you might then literally just write links on the
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.360]   paper, like this is also associated with this, this, and this.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.080]   The idea is you give all these ideas you've thought about, and they all
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.880]   exist in this big linked system.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.760]   And what Luhmann supposedly did, and this is the promise of what we could
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.920]   call pure or hard Zettelkasten, is that it made the actual process of writing
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.800]   papers easily because he would just discover, he would just discover by
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.680]   surfing these links and connections in his slip box, these interesting new
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.560]   ideas that would emerge, and these ideas would become papers.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.800]   All the thinking was largely done.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.720]   The ideas were done.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.320]   It was all there in the slip box.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.640]   That's how you could just write, write, write, write, write.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.440]   And the author of this book, "How to Take Smart Notes," argues that, yeah,
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.720]   writing should not be hard, note-taking should be hard, but if you do this right,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.760]   it should just be easy to write.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.040]   Like the ideas are all there, and you'll just discover like, oh,
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.320]   here's an article, here's a paper.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.680]   All right.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.920]   Well, here's where I stand on this.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.000]   First of all, that idea that writing can be made easy and all the hard
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.320]   works and the note-taking, and then you'll just discover articles.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.440]   I don't buy it.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.800]   I mean, I'm a professional academic, I'm a professional writer.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.480]   It's just not the way it works.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.600]   It's not the way it works.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   I mean, if you're writing a New Yorker piece, you're not just wandering
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.280]   through your slip box and have this interesting collection of things.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.160]   You make some observations that just doesn't work that way.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.880]   It's you're looking at what's going on in the world and what your specialty is,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.720]   and just honed through your instincts of having read a thousand of these
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.320]   articles and written a hundred yourself.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.560]   You come across an idea, like, I think there's something here.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.480]   And then you kind of work backwards.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.200]   What do I already know that could support this?
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.400]   And you have to go out and gather a lot of information on its own.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's really how articles come together.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.320]   I don't buy this idea that they're going to emerge from the system, but I am
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.400]   taken by this idea that this is an interesting way to store notes, that
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.920]   it's not just a hierarchical system of directories and subdirectories
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.000]   and sub-subdirectories and so on.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.200]   But that there's these connections back and forth.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.240]   You have starting points.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.160]   So in a Zettelkasten system, you have an index that goes to some
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.360]   starting points and then you can follow those starting points, have
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.720]   notes all connected to it, but then they jump over to other collections
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.120]   of notes and then from there you can jump over, I think that's actually
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.480]   not a bad way to organize ideas.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.440]   And I do like the homogeneity of the note-taking process that like any
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.880]   thoughts that might be relevant, go into a certain format and go into a
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.040]   certain system, you put them in a certain place and you throw some
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.400]   links to them and it's all in there.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.320]   All right.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   So all this background is to say that I am messing around with a more
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.440]   Zettelkasten style approach to organizing my notes.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.360]   I'm using Rome Research's online tool right now, which I'm really
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.600]   enjoying, I think it's fantastic.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.760]   And I'm trying to do more of this.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.720]   Just get everything that's related, mainly right now for like my writing,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.080]   my non-academic writing, my non-academic, so New Yorker articles, blog posts,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.320]   my books, podcast or podcast related ideas, so things related to this or
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.480]   my newsletter, trying to actually file them away in a Zettelkasten style.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.200]   I do not think that I will be able to do hard Zettelkasten and just have book
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.320]   ideas emerge from the system or blog posts ideas emerge from the system.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.040]   But I think it will allow me to do more thinking upfront when I take notes.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.000]   And to go back and rediscover more sources already when I'm working on
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.840]   something as opposed to having to find everything from scratch from working on.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.000]   I think it is going to help.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.080]   And I think it is going to feel like a closed system.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.680]   Like all these different ideas and thoughts and things I've encountered
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.840]   are all in a system where they're accessible and in a way that is interesting.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.400]   So I'm trying that.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.720]   And I'll report back actually.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.040]   I mean, John, who asked this, it's pretty new for me.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.080]   I might even write a, like a New Yorker piece on this whole, the
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.760]   promise of the second brain, et cetera, et cetera, that it's
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.800]   something I pitched my editor.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.360]   But anyways, that's where I am right now.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.200]   I am messing around with the Piero Zello Cast and Style system.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.920]   If you want to find out more, do the book, how to take smart notes.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.840]   It's a cool, weird, interesting book.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.440]   And again, I don't buy the theory that writing can be made easy, but I do buy
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.680]   the theory of having a consistent approach to taking and storing notes
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.520]   that can handle everything, something I think going on there.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.160]   So we'll see how that goes.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.120]   And I will report back.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   [MUSIC]
