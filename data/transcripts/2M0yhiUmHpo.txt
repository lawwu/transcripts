[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - We hear a lot nowadays about heart rate variability.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.260]   For those of you that have heard of it,
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.660]   and for those of you that haven't,
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.920]   having a higher HRV or heart rate variability
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.700]   is a good thing, right?
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.520]   Normally, if you hear something like heart rate variability,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.440]   sounds like a bad thing,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.760]   turns out it's a great thing.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.160]   Heart rate variability is essentially the distance
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.880]   or the time rather between beats of the heart.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.180]   So you might think that it's great
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.420]   to have a really consistent heart rate, boom, doom,
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.620]   or actually in reality,
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.220]   it's more like and I'm missing some of the beats
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.240]   within the wave form, but you get the idea.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.580]   But actually it's well known to be correlated
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.280]   with a number of positive health outcomes,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.820]   including things related to brain and body and longevity
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.740]   and performance to have high heart rate variability.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.920]   Heart rate variability is going to lead to a pattern
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.520]   of heartbeats that is more like
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.020]   Now, you might say that's arrhythmia.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.140]   Ah, but there are cases of arrhythmia that are good
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.480]   and there are cases of arrhythmia that are bad.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.060]   Higher HRV in general is a good thing.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.520]   You want it during sleep and you want it during wakeful states.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.260]   In sleep, heart rate variability comes about
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.140]   because this vagal pathway from nucleus ambiguous,
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.100]   the cell bodies, the nuclei, literally the DNA within those nuclei
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.760]   of those neurons reside in nucleus ambiguous
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   and they project to the sinoatrial node.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.100]   And every once in a while, they'll just pump the break
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.100]   on heart rate and slow heart rate down.
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.600]   And then they'll come off that break, slow down,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.560]   come off heart rate.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.760]   And here's the really beautiful part.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.760]   And the way that you get actionable leverage over the system,
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.720]   The control by the vagus nerve of the sinoatrial node
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.180]   and heart rate is coordinated with your breathing.
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.880]   Now, as I tell you this, it'll make perfect sense,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.720]   but I just want you to step back from it a second
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.160]   and realize that these systems of the body
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.420]   are so elegantly coordinated.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.340]   And here's how it works with respect to heart rate
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.340]   and breathing.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.000]   When you inhale air, of course, your lungs expand.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.480]   You have a muscle that sits below your lungs
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.680]   called the diaphragm.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.720]   As you inhale air, of course, that diaphragm moves down.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.360]   Now, as your diaphragm moves down and your lungs expand,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.640]   your heart literally has a bit more space
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.000]   in the thoracic cavity to expand.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.760]   Okay, it's not going to swell massively,
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.680]   but it's going to expand.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.500]   Now, as a consequence of that expansion,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.840]   the blood that's moving through your heart
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.540]   is going to move a little bit more slowly per unit volume.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.900]   That is sensed by a particular group of neurons
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.180]   in your heart.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.000]   And that sends a signal to your sympathetic nervous system
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.640]   to speed your heart rate up.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.320]   Put differently, inhaling speeds your heart rate up.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.200]   Now, the converse is also true.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.300]   When you exhale, your lungs deflate,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.980]   your diaphragm moves up.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.960]   And as a consequence,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.160]   there's slightly less space for the heart.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.980]   So the heart shrinks a little bit,
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.180]   not a ton, but it shrinks a little bit.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.140]   And it's enough such that whatever blood is in the heart
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.060]   moves through more quickly per unit volume.
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.320]   That faster movement is sensed by neurons within the heart,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.940]   sends a signal to the brain,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.420]   and the brain activates those neurons within nucleus ambiguous,
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.080]   and very quickly sends a signal to the sinoatrial node
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.060]   to slow your heart rate down.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.920]   Put differently, exhale, slow your heart rate down.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.880]   And they do so by way of vagal control over the sinoatrial node.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.560]   This is the deceleration pathway over heart rate.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.060]   So as I mentioned, this is happening all the time during sleep.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.820]   You don't have to be consciously aware for this to happen.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.960]   It's a fortunate consequence of nature
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.720]   that the neurons within your brainstem
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   that control breathing,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.280]   and the neurons within your brainstem that control heart rate,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.320]   and the other neurons within the heart itself
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.240]   that control heart rate, the pacemaker cells,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.800]   all can function without you having to think about it.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.120]   That's a wonderful thing for obvious reasons.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.240]   It's also the case that because we have this input
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.640]   from the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.160]   down through a couple of other structures,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.680]   like the cingulate and the insula,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.220]   and that converge on nucleus ambiguous,
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.860]   if you decide to slow your heart rate down, you can do it.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.680]   And you do so by doing a deliberate exhale
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.880]   and or by increasing the intensity
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.980]   or the duration of your exhale.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.600]   So you can do that right now.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.720]   If you want to slow your heart rate down,
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.280]   that is if you want to increase
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.020]   parasympathetic nervous system activity,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.760]   and you want to calm down fast,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.880]   you can literally just .
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.820]   Exhale, slow your heart rate down,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.120]   and exhales tilt that seesaw
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.080]   that is the autonomic nervous system
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.680]   more toward the parasympathetic side.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.260]   Now, I've talked before on this podcast
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.620]   and all over social media
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.640]   about the so-called physiological sigh,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.600]   a naturally occurring form of breathing
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.660]   that occurs in sleep and that we can deliberately do
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.600]   anytime we want to calm down fast.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.520]   And the physiological sigh consists of,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.720]   as many of you know, two inhales through the nose,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.700]   followed by a long to lungs empty exhale through the mouth.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.800]   Typically the first inhale is longer.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.840]   Again, it's done through the nose.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.520]   The second inhale is shorter, kind of a sharp inhale
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.000]   to make sure you maximally inflate
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.560]   all the little sacks within your lungs.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.180]   And then the exhale is a long, slow exhale
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.500]   that dumps all your air.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.520]   I'll just demonstrate the physiological sigh for you.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.260]   For those of you that haven't seen it,
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.040]   you again, big inhale through the nose,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.580]   second sharp inhale through the nose
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.300]   to make sure you maximally inflate the lungs,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.680]   and then long exhale to lungs empty.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.280]   It goes like this.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.200]   Okay, lungs are empty.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   That is indeed the fastest way to activate the parasympathetic
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.260]   nervous system, and to tilt that seesaw from levels of high
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.420]   sympathetic nervous system activation to lower levels of sympathetic
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.460]   nervous system activation.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.180]   In fact, I immediately feel calmer.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.920]   Maybe you can even hear it in my voice.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.460]   So when you do a physiological effect,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.420]   you're getting both a chemical signal into the brain.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.720]   That is the adjustment of that carbon dioxide oxygen ratio.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.640]   It's mainly due to the offloading of carbon dioxide.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.280]   That lower level of carbon dioxide is registered by the brain
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.200]   very quickly and leads to an increase in calm.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.360]   The deceleration of heart rate driven by the exhale
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.400]   is also registered by the brain very quickly,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.220]   leads to an increase in calm.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.540]   When you just emphasize an exhale,
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.040]   meaning you extend it or you make it more intense,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.200]   and you don't do the two inhales first,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.580]   that is you don't do the physiological sigh.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.380]   Well, you get the mechanical signal,
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.120]   but you don't get the chemical signal,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.460]   at least not to the same degree you do
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.140]   with the physiological sigh.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.880]   Put simply, if you want to calm down fast,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.720]   ideally you do the physiological sigh.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.520]   However, it turns out that one of the best ways
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   to improve your HRV,
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.580]   both in sleep and in wakeful states,
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.740]   which takes a very minimum of effort
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.840]   and is rarely if ever discussed,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.660]   is simply throughout the day,
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.860]   I would say 10, 15, maybe even 20 times per day,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.080]   anytime it occurs to you
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.400]   to just deliberately extend your exhale,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.820]   that is to pump the brake on your heart rate
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.980]   through the vagus nerve pathway
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.820]   that I've been describing.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.400]   Just, just exhale, slow your heart rate down
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.180]   and then get about your normal routine.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.940]   You can do that essentially anytime you remember to.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.720]   This is literally going to increase your HRV.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.940]   You now know the mechanism by which it does that.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.980]   And get this,
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.200]   it will also increase your HRV in sleep at night.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.160]   And the reason is this pathway
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.980]   that originates with the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.560]   and goes down to nucleus ambiguous
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.480]   and then to the sinoatrial node of the heart
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.960]   because it's under conscious control
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.240]   and because it's subject to what we call plasticity,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.600]   to strengthening and to weakening.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.740]   That is, if you use it deliberately, it gets strengthened.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.980]   If you don't use it deliberately, it gets weakened.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.360]   Well, that's a great thing
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.520]   because it means that if you just simply remember
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.600]   to do some extended exhales throughout the day,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.400]   you're going to strengthen this pathway such that it operates
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.560]   in the background through auto-regulation
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.780]   without you ever having to think about it.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.940]   Now, of course, that effect wears off over time
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.760]   if you don't occasionally remember to just do some,
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.100]   some longer exhales.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.160]   But this is a wonderful protocol in my opinion,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.100]   because it capitalizes on a inborn circuit, right?
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.480]   A circuit that you were born with that is already installed,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.960]   that you can use at any point.
