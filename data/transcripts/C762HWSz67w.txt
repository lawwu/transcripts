[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   I have a little surprise for my besties. Everybody's been
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.840]   getting incredible adulation. People have been getting
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.080]   incredible feedback on the podcast. It is a phenomenon as
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.640]   we know. And I thought it was time for us to do performance
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.700]   reviews of each bestie. Now I, as executive producer, I'm not
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.100]   in a position to do your performance reviews. I too need
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.560]   to have a performance review. So I thought I would let the
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.600]   audience do their performance reviews. So we went and we're
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.480]   debuting a new feature today. This very moment. It's called
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.720]   Reddit performance review. God cue some music here, some
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.600]   graphics, Reddit performance reviews. And so we'll start off
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.720]   with you, David Friedberg. This proves why you haven't been
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.080]   successful in life so far.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.600]   You kidding me?
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.960]   I'm trying to build a successful enterprise instead of keeping
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.120]   the judgment to yourself, which is what all elite performers do.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.160]   Yes. You turned it over to a bunch of mids on Reddit. Yes.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.200]   Tell you, they were already doing it. They were already
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   doing it. We just collected it.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.240]   What elucidation were you going to get from Reddit? Yeah, really?
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.680]   Let's not ruin the bit. Do you think Elon does 360 performance
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.200]   reviews?
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.160]   On Reddit? On Reddit of all things? You know how many 360
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.680]   performance reviews I've done in my life? Zero, of course. And
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.480]   that's why this will be so entertaining.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.520]   Okay, go go start off with me. Let's hear it.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.840]   Here's how it's gonna work. You are going to be presented with
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.600]   the candid feedback that you've gotten in the last 30 days on
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   Reddit. But for the first time, and you have to read it out loud
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.400]   to the class, Friedberg, you'll go first. Here's your first
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.000]   piece of candid feedback in your 360 from the Reddit in cells.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.280]   Good Friedberg read it out loud.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.080]   David Friedberg deserves more hate. He and the others have
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.000]   made it their mission to convince us that reforming social
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.920]   security is the only way forward to survive. He hides behind this
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240]   nerdy a political persona, and then goes hard right out of
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.480]   nowhere. exact fear mongered about the deficit as an excuse
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.640]   to restructure entitlement programs, we would see that as
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.080]   the partisan right wing take it is when Friedberg does it. We're
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.000]   supposed to act like he has no skin in this game. He's just the
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.440]   science guy. No, he's a rich guy who would rather work your
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.320]   grandparents to death and pay an extra 5% tax.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.880]   All right, there's your review. Very good. I think you took it
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.600]   well. And you don't have to respond now. Don't just take it
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.160]   just to counter briefly, I have highlighted multiple times. I
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.040]   think we're going to 70% tax rates. But hey, you know, right
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.320]   there on everyone's got an opinion that won't generate more
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.480]   revenue. Yeah, history's any guide? Yeah.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.120]   Well, the audience has been waiting for this. David Sachs
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.880]   has never taken a piece of feedback and the feedback he has
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.640]   gotten he hasn't taken well. So here we go, David. Here's your
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.600]   performance. Go ahead. I just read this go with the bit. Come
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.400]   on. It's a little feedback for you. Come on. All right. And I'm
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.920]   gonna do this too. And I haven't seen mine.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.200]   Oh, Nick pulled these. Nick police. This is not
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.280]   these are actual pieces of real feedback.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.160]   Fire. That's it. Get out of here.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.280]   Good sex.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.040]   The thing about David Sachs, if he wasn't rich, everyone would
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.000]   dismiss him as being both stupid and boring. The secret to his
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.360]   wealth is just follow Peter Thiel around since college. It's
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.240]   like if turtle from Entourage pretend to be a public
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.840]   intellectual.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.440]   Okay, so the dictator
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.240]   has never had a 360 review. He informs us and I think his staff
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.360]   you know, for all the people at social capital, you can get in
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.800]   on this by just posting to Reddit since he won't do 360
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.960]   reviews at social capital guy. Let's pull up two months.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.320]   Feedback for the quarter.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.680]   Is the biggest self serving leech. As long as he can make a
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.360]   dollar trade on it. He will burn anything down to the ground.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.640]   Fuck the consequences to society or anyone else.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.440]   This was actually the good
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.400]   positive
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.480]   Why'd you give him such a good review?
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.880]   That's the truth.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.280]   I got to read mine. I haven't seen this. I'm bracing for
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.240]   impact here. Oh, no.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.600]   What's the critique exactly? What is the critique from all
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.960]   these
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.600]   proof from that? I mean, that's like,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.160]   pretty accurate. Okay. All right, here we go. I got to read
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.440]   mine. Okay. I can't wait for AI to replace Jake. Jake is the
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.840]   least skilled knowledge worker on the show. I think he has
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   about three shows left before AI replaces his hosting skills.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.720]   And ability to trick dentists into investing in high
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.680]   last part.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.640]   I do have a lot of dentist friends in the funds. Okay, I'm
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.080]   gonna pay for a lot of kids dentist school.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.360]   Great idea. Great idea. J. Kelton give
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.120]   one group one, this is one for the whole group. This is a group
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.080]   survey. This is our group 360 vote to rename the podcast. The
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.600]   vote is binding and the podcast we renamed
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.920]   three billionaires and J. Kel three kind of smart guys and J
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.840]   Cal three assholes and freebird.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.720]   That's a good one.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:17.480]   All right, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast. We're still
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.600]   here episode 129. All in summit 2023. General Admission sold
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.400]   out. Too many people apply for scholarships that's on pause.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.960]   And there's a couple of VIP tickets left get them while
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.680]   they're hot. Just search for all in summit freeberg. Anything to
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.400]   add? We'll just get through the grift real quick here.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.840]   No, it's gonna get it all right. That was it.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.360]   Yeah, I mean, just more demand than we predicted. We look for a
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.040]   bigger venue couldn't find one. We're I think we're excited
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.240]   about Royce Hall. It's still as you pointed out two and a half
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.280]   times the size of last year. So we want to make sure it's a
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.920]   great quality event. But unfortunately, way too many
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.360]   folks want to go so we have to kind of pause ticket sales.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.960]   What's my wine budget? $300 per person per night $1,000 per VIP
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.600]   per event. Thank you. Okay, I will handle it from here. So
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.920]   there's 750 of them. So I think you have $750,000 in wine
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:15.560]   budget. I just can't believe I just gave him 750 by wide by
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.800]   guys, I'm going to curate an incredible
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.640]   here today, by the way, he's
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.320]   Oh, doing some way. Yes, no, he Josh,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.600]   some way Josh. All right, let's get to work. Let's get to work.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.880]   Okay, the Senate had a hearing this week for AI. Sam Altman was
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.960]   there as well as Gary Marcus, a professor from NYU. That's an
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.320]   overpriced college in New York City. And Christina Montgomery,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.120]   the chief privacy and trust officer from IBM, which had
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.520]   Watson before anybody else was in the AI business. And I think
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.800]   they deprecated it or they stopped working on it, which is
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   quite paradoxical. There were a couple of very interesting
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.040]   moments. Sam claimed the US should create a separate agency
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.640]   to oversee AI, I guess he's in the Chamath camp. He wants the
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.480]   agency to issue licenses to train and use AI models, a
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.600]   little regulatory capture there, as we say in the biz. He also
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.720]   claims, and this was interesting dovetailing with Ilan's CNBC
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.440]   interview with I think Dave Farber, which is very good, that
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.040]   he owns no equity in open AI whatsoever, and was quote, doing
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.440]   it because he loves it. Any thoughts, Chamath, you did say
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.800]   that this would happen two months ago. And here we are two
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.080]   months later. And exactly what you said would happen is in the
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.200]   process of happening. regulation, licensing and
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:46.120]   regulatory capture, Sam went a little further than I sketched
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.440]   out a few months ago, which is that he also said that it may
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.800]   make sense for us to issue licenses for these models to
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.000]   even be compiled. And for these models to actually do the
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.200]   learning. And I thought that that was really interesting,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.400]   because what it speaks to is a form of KYC, right? Know your
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.800]   customer. And again, when you look at markets that can be
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.040]   subject to things like fraud and manipulation, right, where you
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.840]   can have a lot of bad actors, banking is the most obvious one.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.400]   We use things like KYC to make sure that money flows are
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.640]   happening appropriately and between parties that were the
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.440]   intention is legal. And so I think that that's actually
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.600]   probably the most important new bit of perspective that he is
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.040]   adding as somebody right in the middle of it, which is that you
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   should apply to this agency to get a license to then allow you
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.920]   to compile a model. And I think that that was a really
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.680]   interesting thing. The other thing that I said, and I said
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.840]   this in my in a tweet just a couple days ago is I'm really
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.360]   surprised actually, where this is the first time in modern
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.080]   history that I can remember, where we've invented something
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.160]   we being Silicon Valley, and the people in Silicon Valley are the
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.960]   ones that are more circumspect than the folks on Wall Street or
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.800]   other areas. And if you see if you gauge the sentiment, the
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.920]   hedge funds and family offices right now are just giddy about
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.760]   AI. And it turns out if you look at the 13 Fs, they're all long
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.640]   NVIDIA and AMD. But if you actually look at the other side
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.480]   of the coin, which is the folks in Silicon Valley, that's
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.720]   actually making it the rest of us are like, hey, let's crawl
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.120]   before we walk before we run.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.720]   Yeah, let's think about guardrails. Let's be thoughtful
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.680]   here. And so the big money people are saying, let's place
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.120]   bets. And the people building in are saying, Hey, let's be
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.640]   thoughtful sack, which is opposite to what it's always
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.160]   been, I think, right? We're like, hey, let's let's run with
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.960]   this. And Wall Street's like, prove it to me. sacks, you are a
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.040]   less regulation guy. You are free market monster. I've heard
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.680]   you've been called. You don't believe that we should license
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.400]   this. What do you think about what you're seeing here? And
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.320]   there is some cynical, cynical thoughts about what we just saw
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.160]   happen in terms of people in the lead, wanting to maintain their
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.880]   lead by creating red tape. What are your thoughts?
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.360]   Yeah, of course. I think, you know, Sam just went straight for
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.560]   the endgame here, which is regulatory capture. Normally,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.440]   when a tech executive goes and testifies at these hearings,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.240]   they're in the hot seat, and they get grilled. And that
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.840]   didn't happen here. Because, you know, Sam Allman basically bought
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.720]   into the narrative of these senators. And he basically
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.200]   conceded all these risks associated with with AI talked
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.280]   about how chat GPT style models, if unregulated, could increase
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.640]   online misinformation, bolster cyber criminals, even threaten
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.600]   confidence in election systems. So he basically bought into the
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.840]   senators narrative. And like you said, agree to create a new
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.000]   agency that would license models and can take licenses away. He
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.840]   said that he would create safety standards, specific tests that
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.640]   the model has to pass before it can be deployed. He says he
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.720]   would require independent audits who can say the model is or
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.400]   isn't in compliance. And by basically buying into their
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.880]   narrative and agreeing to everything they want, which is
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.920]   to create all these new regulations and a new agency, I
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.760]   think that Sam is pretty much guaranteeing that he'll be one
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.080]   of the people who gets to help shape the new agency and the
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.480]   rules they're going to operate under and what these independent
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.680]   audits are going to how they're going to determine what's in
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.600]   compliance. So he is basically putting a big boat around his
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   own incumbency here. And so yes, it is a smart strategy for him.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.120]   But the question is, do we really need any of this stuff?
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.720]   And you know, what you heard at the hearing is that just like
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   with just about every other tech issue, the centers on the
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.240]   judiciary committee didn't exhibit any real understanding
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.400]   of the technology. And so they all generally talked about their
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   own hobby horses. So you know, you heard from Senator
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.000]   Blackburn, she wants to protect songwriters. Holly wants to stop
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.120]   anti conservative bias. Klobuchar was touting a couple
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.200]   of bills that have her name on them once called the JCP a
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.480]   journalism competition preservation Bernie Sanders want
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.240]   to do he wants to protect the 1% of the one Durbin hate section
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.560]   230. That was the hobby horse he was riding and then Senator
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.600]   Blumenthal was obsessed that someone had published deep fakes
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.680]   of himself. So you know, all of these different senators had
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.160]   different theories of harm that they were promoting. And they
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.920]   were all basically hammers looking for a nail. You know,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.560]   they all wanted to regulate this thing. And they didn't really
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.880]   pay much of any attention to the ways that existing laws could
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.920]   already be used. Absolutely. To stop any of these things. If you
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.920]   commit a crime with AI, there are plenty of criminal laws,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.000]   every single thing they talked about could be handled through
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.440]   existing law, if they're not doing harms at all. Yeah, but
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.760]   they want to jump right to creating a new agency and
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:58.000]   regulations. And Sam, I think did the, you know, expedient
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.640]   thing here, which is basically buy into it in order to was a
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.680]   chance to be an insider. If this was a chess game, Sam got to the
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.080]   mid game, he traded all the pieces and went right to the end
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.600]   game. Let's just try to checkmate here. I've got the
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   lead. I got the 10 billion from Microsoft. Everybody else get a
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.640]   license and try to catch up Friedberg. We have Chamath pro
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.760]   regulation licensing, I think, or just being pretty thoughtful
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.240]   about it. There you got sacks being typically a free market
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.800]   monster, let the laws be what they are. But these senators are
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.720]   going to do regulatory capture. Where do you as a sultan of
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.240]   science stand on this very important issue?
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:39.640]   I think there's a more important kind of broader set of trends
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.600]   that are worth noting and that the folks doing these hearings
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.640]   and having these conversations are aware of, which implies why
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.280]   they might be saying the things that they're saying. That's not
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.960]   necessarily about regulatory capture. And that is that a lot
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.680]   of these models can be developed and generated to be much smaller.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.560]   We're seeing, you know, models that can effectively run on an
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.160]   iPhone, we're seeing a number of open source models that are
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.440]   being published. Now there's a group called mosaic ml. Last
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.920]   week, they published what looks like a pretty good quality model
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.240]   that has, you know, a very large kind of token input, which means
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.440]   you can do a lot with it. And that model can be downloaded and
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   used by anyone for free, you know, really good open source
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.840]   license that they've provided on that model. And that's really
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.760]   just the tip of the iceberg on what's going on, which is that
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.000]   these models are very quickly becoming ubiquitous,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.760]   commoditized, small, and effectively are able to move to
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.400]   and be run on the edge of the network. As a result, that means
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.520]   that it's very hard to see who's using what models how behind the
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.400]   products and tools that they're building. And so if that's the
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.600]   trend, then it becomes very hard for a regulatory agency to go in
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.680]   and audit every server, or every computer or every computer on a
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.080]   network and say, What model are you running? Is that an approved
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.360]   model? Is that not an approved model? It's almost like having a
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:04.120]   regulatory agency that has to go in and audit and assess whether
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.920]   a Linux upgrade or some sort of, you know, open source platform
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   that's that's being run on some server is appropriately vetted
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.200]   and checked. And so it's almost like a fool's errand. And so if
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.560]   I'm running one of these companies, and I'm trying to,
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.200]   you know, get Congress off my butt and get all these
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.880]   regulators off my butt, I'm going to say, go ahead and
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.480]   regulate us. Because the truth is, there really isn't a great
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.080]   or easy path or ability to do that. And there certainly won't
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.040]   be in five or 10 years. Once these models all move on to the
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.600]   edge of the network, and they're all being turned around all the
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.000]   time every day. And there's a great evolution underway. So I
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   actually take a point of view that it's not just that this is
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.200]   necessarily bad. And there's cronyism going on. I think that
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.520]   the point of view is just that this is going to be a near
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.760]   impossible task to try and track and approve LLM and audit servers
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.720]   that are running LLM and audit apps and audit what's behind the
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.400]   tools that everyday people are using. And I wish everyone the
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.440]   best of luck in trying to do so. But that's kind of the joke of
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   the whole thing is like, let's go ahead and paddle these
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.360]   Congress people on the shoulder and say you got it. Right?
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.000]   There you have it, folks. Wrong answer. shamatha sacks. Right
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.880]   answer. Friedberg. If you were to look at hugging face, if you
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.480]   don't know what that is, it's a basically an open source
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.720]   repository of all of the LLM. The cat is out of the bag, the
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.840]   horses have left the barn. If you look at what I'm showing on
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.000]   the screen here, this is the open LLM leaderboard kind of
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.920]   buried on hugging face. If you haven't been to hugging face,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.600]   this is where developers show their work, they share their
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.480]   work. And they kind of compete with each other in a social
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.680]   network showing all their contributions. And what they do
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.760]   here is and this is super fascinating. They have a series
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.600]   of tests that will take an LLM language model and they will
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.320]   have it do science questions that would be for grade school.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.520]   They'll do a test of mathematics, US history,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.720]   computer science, etc.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.520]   There's a jeopardy test to I don't know if it's on here, but
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.240]   the jeopardy test is really good. It's like straight up
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.480]   jeopardy trivia and see if it can answer the questions. Yeah,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.920]   which actually, Friedberg was actually his high school
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.440]   jeopardy championship three years in a row. But anyway, on
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.960]   this leaderboard, you can see the language models are out
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.480]   pacing what open AI did. I'm sorry, closed AI is what I call
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.520]   it now because they're closed source, closed AI and Bard have
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.360]   admitted that internal person at Bard said the language models
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.280]   here are now outpacing what they're able to do with much
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.760]   more resources. Many hands makes for light work, the open source
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.120]   models are going to fit on your phone or the latest, you know,
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.240]   Apple silicon. So I think the cat's out of the bag. I don't
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.080]   know how they
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.520]   pull something incompatible about that. What Friedberg just
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.200]   said with what I said, in fact, freeberg's point bolsters my
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.200]   point, it's highly impractical to regulate open source software
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.720]   in this way. Also, when you look at that list of things that
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.160]   people are doing on hugging face, there's nothing nefarious
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.720]   about it.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.280]   Yeah, and all the harms that were described are already
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.800]   illegal and can be prosecuted. Exactly. Some special agency,
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   you know, giving it seal of approval. Again, this is going
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.960]   to replace permissionless innovation, which is what has
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.240]   defined the software industry and especially open source with
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.280]   the need to develop some connection or relationship and
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.480]   lobbying in Washington to go get your project approved. And
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.600]   there's no really good reason for this, except for the fact
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.080]   that the senators on the judiciary committee and all of
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.280]   Washington really wants more control. So they can get more
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.000]   donations.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.320]   Saks have a question. Do you think that creating the DMV and
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.840]   requiring a driver's license limits the ability for people to
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.720]   learn how to drive
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.040]   the DMV is like the classic example of how government
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.960]   doesn't work. I don't know why you'd want to make that your
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.440]   example. I mean, people have to spend all day waiting in line.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.240]   He sends people to it. He's got a VIP person waiting in line to
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.920]   get your photo taken. It's insane. I mean, everyone has a
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.360]   miserable experience with it. No, but it's highly relevant
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.920]   because you're right. If you create an agency where people
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.200]   have to go get their permission, it's a licensing scheme. You're
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.000]   gonna be waiting in some line of untold length. It won't be like
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.560]   a physical line at the DMV building, it's gonna be a
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.720]   virtual line where you're in some queue, where there's
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.640]   probably gonna be some overwork regulator who doesn't even know
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.080]   how they're supposed to approve your project. They're just gonna
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.480]   be trying to cover their ass because if the project ends up
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.400]   being something nefarious, then they get blamed for it. So
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.600]   that's what's gonna end up happening.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.560]   Let me also highlight something that I think is maybe I think
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.160]   the gut a little bit, maybe a little bit misunderstood. But,
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.760]   you know, an AI model is an algorithm. So it's a it's a
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.240]   piece of software that takes data in and spits data out. And
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.440]   you know, we have algorithms that are written by humans, we
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.840]   have algorithms that have been, you know, written by machines,
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.640]   these are machine learn models, which is what a lot of what
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.720]   people are calling AI today is effectively an extension of an
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:00.400]   out of. And so the idea that a particular algorithm is
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.040]   differentiated from another algorithm is also what makes
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.240]   this very difficult, because these are algorithms that are
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.320]   embedded and sit within products and applications that an end
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.240]   user and end customer ultimately uses. And I just sent you guys a
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.200]   link to the you know, the EU has been working towards passing
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.120]   this AI. Here we go. There are a couple of weeks ahead of these
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.080]   conversations in the US. But I mean, as you read through this
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.960]   AI act, and the proposal that it's that it's put forth, it
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.280]   almost becomes the kind of thing that you say, I just don't know
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.640]   if these folks really understand how the technology works,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.720]   because it's almost as if they're going to audit and have,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.080]   you know, an assessment of the risk level of every software
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.960]   application out there. And that the tooling and the necessary
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.200]   infrastructure to be able to do that just makes no sense. In the
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.680]   context of open source software in the context of an open
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.240]   internet, in the context of how quickly software and applications
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.520]   and tools evolve, and you make tweaks to an algorithm, and you
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.720]   got to resubmit it for authorization,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.680]   or you can be sure their number one job Friedberg is going to
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.640]   be to protect jobs. So anything there that in any way infringes
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.760]   on somebody's ability to be employed in a position, whether
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.640]   it's an artist or a writer, or a developer, they're going to say,
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.880]   you can't use these tools, or they're going to try to throttle
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.320]   them to try to protect jobs, because that's their number one
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.480]   job. All three of you. Do you guys think that this was Sam's
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.160]   way of pulling up the ladder behind him? Of course, 100% just
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.240]   like, Oh, absolutely. It's and it's because no, you can, you
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.640]   can prove it. He made open AI closed AI by making it not open
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.760]   source. If you're Sam, you're smart enough to know how quickly
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.120]   the models are commoditizing and how many different models there
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.040]   are, that, you know, can provide similar degrees of
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.240]   functionality, as you just pointed out, J. Cal. So I don't
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.960]   think it's about trying to lock in your model. I think it's
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.920]   about recognizing the impracticality of creating some
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.840]   regulatory regime around model auditing. And so you're very so
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.280]   that in that in that world, in that scenario, where you have
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.880]   that vision, you have that foresight, do you go to Congress
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.400]   and tell them that they're dumb to regulate AI? Or do you go to
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.520]   Congress and you say, Great, you should regulate AI? Knowing that
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.760]   it's like, hey, yeah, you should go ahead and stop the sun from
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.640]   shining. You know, like, it's just Yeah, so basically, he's
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.520]   telling them to do that. Because he knows they can't. Therefore,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.200]   he gets all the points, all the joy points, all the social
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.480]   credit, I don't wanna say virtual signaling, but he gets
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.720]   all the credit relationship credit with Washington for
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.840]   saying what they want to hear reflecting back to them. Even
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.400]   though he knows they can't compete with Facebook's open
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.720]   model, which is number one.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.680]   Yeah, there is historical precedent interesting for
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.000]   companies that are facing congressional scrutiny, to go to
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.800]   Congress and say, go ahead and regulate us as a way of
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.960]   preemptively. Yeah. And I think that it doesn't necessarily
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.440]   mean you're going to get regulated. But it's a way of
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.680]   kind of creating some relief and getting everyone to take a
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.360]   breather and a sigh of relief and be like, okay, the
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.560]   industry is with us, you know, they're
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.080]   guard. What do you think of the strategy? Saks the guard as
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.280]   strategy he's pulling here?
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.400]   Let's guard as
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.920]   I think that's in chess when you are going to take the queen.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.200]   What's like, anyway, what do you think of his chess?
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.560]   That's not a strategy in chess. So I think it is a chess move.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.800]   Nonetheless,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.640]   is he pulling up the ladder sacks or no,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.720]   I don't think that's his number one goal. But I think it is the
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.680]   result. And so I think the the goal here is I think he's got
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.920]   to pass in front of him when you go to testify like this, you can
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.600]   either resist, and they will put you in the hot seat and just
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.720]   grill you for a few hours, or you can sort of concede and you
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.520]   buy into their narrative. And then you kind of get through the
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.680]   hearing without being grilled. And so I think on that level,
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.720]   it's preferable just to kind of play ball. And then the other
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.360]   thing is that by playing ball, you get to be part of the
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.040]   insiders club that's going to shape these regulations. And
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.320]   that will I wouldn't say it's a ladder coming up, I think it's
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.280]   more of a moat, where because it's not that the ladder comes
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.320]   up and nobody else can get in. But the regulations are gonna be
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.120]   a pretty big moat around major incumbents who know they qualify
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.320]   for this because we're gonna write these standards. So at the
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.940]   end of the day, if you're someone in Sam's shoes, you're
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:21.280]   like, why resist and make myself a target, or I'll just buy into
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.720]   the narrative and help shape the regulations. And it's good for
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.200]   my business.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.240]   I like the analysis, gentlemen, this is a perfect analysis. Let
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   me ask you a question tomorrow. What is the commercial incentive
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.080]   from your point of view, to ask for regulation and to be
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.240]   pro regulation, your pro regulation? Can you just
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.840]   highlight for me at least what you think? You know, the
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.920]   commercial reason is to do that? You know, how do you benefit
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.280]   from that? Like, not you personally, but generally, like,
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.120]   where does benefit arise?
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.560]   I think that certain people in a sphere of influence, and I would
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.840]   put us in that category, have to have the intellectual capacity
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:02.720]   to see beyond ourselves and ask what's for the greater good. I
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.320]   think Buffett is right. Two weeks ago, he equated AI to
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.960]   nuclear weapons, which is an incredibly powerful technology
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:17.600]   whose genie you can't put back in the bottle, whose 99.9% of use
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.480]   cases are generally quite societally positive, but the
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.400]   point 1% of use cases destroys humanity. And so I think you
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.880]   guys are unbelievably naive on this topic, and you're letting
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:37.480]   your ideology fight your common sense. The reality is that there
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.720]   are probably 95 billion trillion use cases that are incredibly
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.200]   positive. But the 1000 negative use cases are so destructive.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.120]   And they're equally possible. And the reason they're equally
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.960]   possible. And this is where I think there's a lot of
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.600]   intellectual dishonesty here is, we don't even know how
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.840]   transformers work. The best thing that happened when
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.680]   Facebook open source llama was also that somebody stealthily
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.480]   released all the model weights. Yeah. Okay, so
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.080]   I don't think that a little bit for a neophyte what we're
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.120]   talking about. So there's the model and there's the weights,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.600]   think about it as it's a solution to a problem. The
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.480]   solution looks like a polynomial equation. Okay, let's take a
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.440]   very simple one. Let's take Pythagorean theorem, you know, x
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.920]   squared plus y squared equals z squared. Okay. So if you want to
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.280]   solve an answer to a problem, you have these weights, you have
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.040]   these variables, and you have these weights associated with
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.320]   it, the slope of a line y equals mx plus b, okay, what a computer
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.280]   does with AI is it figures out what the variables are. And it
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.080]   figures out what the weights are the answer to identifying images
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.400]   flawlessly turns out to be 2x plus seven, where x equals this
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.560]   thing. Now take that example and multiply it by 500 billion
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.640]   parameters, and 500 billion weights. And that is what an AI
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.120]   model essentially gives us to it as an answer to a question. So
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.880]   even when Facebook released llama, what they essentially
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.320]   gave us was the equation, but not the weights. And then what
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.880]   this guy did, I think it was an intern, apparently, or somebody,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   he just left the weights, so that we immediately knew what
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.920]   the structure of the equation look like. So that's what we're
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.760]   basically solving against. But we don't know how these things
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.400]   work. We don't really know how transformers work. And so this
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.440]   is my point, when I think you guys are right about the
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.280]   overwhelming majority of the use cases, but there will be people
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.800]   who can nefariously create havoc and chaos. And I think you got
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.400]   to slow the whole ship down to prevent those few folks from
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.280]   ruining it for everybody.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.400]   Let me just talk with you. I haven't had a chance to chime in
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.760]   on my position. So I'd like to just make my mind. Nobody cares.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.200]   Okay, well, I do. I think actually, I split the
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.800]   difference here a little bit. I don't think it needs to be an
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   agency and licensing. I do think we have to have a commission. And
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.560]   we do need to have people being thoughtful about those 1000 use
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.320]   cases chamath because they are going to cause societal harm or
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.160]   things that we cannot anticipate. And then number two,
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.440]   for the neophyte with the 1600 rating on chess.com sacks,
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.840]   Gardez, an announcement to the opponent that their queen is
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.940]   under direct attack similar to the announcement of check the
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.000]   warning was customary until the early 20th century. So since you
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.200]   do not know the history of check, now you've learned
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.720]   something early 20th century. Okay, well, since I've only
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.640]   played chess in the 20th and 21st centuries, I'm unaware of
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.040]   that. Jekyll and Francis Brown's got the girl they play man if he
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.200]   got the go ahead free bird in the context of what we're
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.320]   talking about that models are becoming smaller and can be run
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.560]   on the edge. And there's obviously hundreds and thousands
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.320]   of variants of these open source models that have, you know, good
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.880]   effect, and perhaps compete with some of these, these models that
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.760]   you're mentioning that are closed source. How do you
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.260]   regulate that? How do you and then they sit behind an
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.520]   application? I sit behind tooling? Yeah.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.240]   I think in order for you to be able to compile that model to
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   generate that initial instantiation, you're still
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   running it in a cluster of 1000s of GPUs.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.520]   But let's say we're past that.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.040]   You can't be past that. We're not past that yet. Okay, we
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.280]   don't have 5 million models, we don't have all kinds of things
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.680]   that solve all kinds of problems. We don't have an open
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.880]   source available simulation of every single molecule in the
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.200]   world, including all the toxic materials that could destroy
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.080]   humans. We don't have that yet. So before that is created, and
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.240]   shrunk down to an iPhone, I think we need to put some stage
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.680]   gates up to slow people down.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.080]   What do you mean by those stage gates? Yeah,
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.040]   I think you need some form of KYC. I think before you're
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.440]   allowed to run a massive cluster to generate the model that then
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.600]   you try to shrink, you need to be able to show people that
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.280]   you're not trying to do something absolutely chaotic, or
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.360]   have it creating that I don't think
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.920]   that that could be as simple as putting your driver's license
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.560]   and your social security number that you're working on an
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.520]   instance in a cloud, right? It could be you're putting your
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.280]   name on your work,
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.520]   it becomes slightly more nuanced than that. It's like, I think
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.880]   that J Cal, that's probably the simplest thing for AWS GCP and
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.720]   as you're to do, which is that if you want to run over a
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.200]   certain number of GPU clusters, you need to put in that
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.680]   information. I think you also need to put in your tax ID
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.280]   number. So I think if you want to run a real high scale model,
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.440]   that's still going to run you 10s or hundreds of millions of
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.720]   dollars. I do think there aren't that many people running those
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.640]   things. And I do think it's easy to police those and say, what
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.480]   are you trying to do here?
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.920]   So let me just push back on that. Because mosaic ml publish
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.040]   this model that is, let me I can pull up the performance chart
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.080]   or Nick, maybe you can just find it on their website real quick
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.560]   at the new model they published to mock bait, trained this model
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:49.240]   on open source data that's publicly available. And they
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.160]   spent $200,000 on a cluster run to build this model and look at
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.880]   how it performs compared to some of the top models that are
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.640]   closed source.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.360]   Just say it for the people who are listening.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   Yeah. So for people that are listening, basically, this
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.880]   model is called mpt seven B. That's the name of the AI model,
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.600]   the LLM model that was generated by this group called mosaic ml.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.000]   And they spent $200,000 creating this model from scratch. And the
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.520]   data that they trained it on is all listed here. It's all
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.720]   publicly available data that you can just download off the
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.160]   internet, then they score how well it performs on its results
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.600]   against other big models out there like llama seven B.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:31.080]   Yeah, but he I know, but I don't exactly know what the actual
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.320]   problems they're trying to ask it to compare.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.760]   Right. So the but the point is that this model theoretically
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.720]   could then be applied to a different data set once it's
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.320]   been, you know, built. I don't think so. I just want to use
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.600]   your point earlier about toxic chemistry, because models were
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.520]   generated, and then other data was then used to fine tune those
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.120]   models and deliver an output.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.240]   Hold on a second, like those answers were to specific kinds
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.640]   of questions. If you wanted to all of a sudden ask totally
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.960]   orthogonal thing of that model, that model would fail, you would
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.280]   have to go back and you'd have to retrain it. That training does
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.200]   cost some amount of money. So if you said to me, h math, I could
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.760]   build you a model trained on the universe of every single
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.400]   molecule in the world. And I could actually give you
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.600]   something that could generate the toxic list of all the
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   molecules and how to make it for $200,000. I would be really
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.680]   scared. I don't think that that's possible today. So I
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.360]   don't understand these actual tests. But I don't think it's
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.040]   true that you could take this model and these model weights,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.240]   apply it to a different set of data and get useful answers.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.400]   But let's let's assume for a minute that you can, in fact,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.280]   take $200,000 worth of
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.560]   I don't want to assume it. Here's my point. I want to tell
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.600]   you what's happening right now, which is that's not possible. So
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.800]   we should stop so that then I don't have to have this argument
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.880]   with you in a year from now, which is like, hey, some jack
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.560]   jerk off just created this model. Now the cat's out of the
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.520]   bag. So let's not do it. Yeah. And, and then what's going to
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.960]   happen is like some chaotic seeking organization is going to
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.640]   print one of these materials and release it into the wild to
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.960]   prove it. But here's the point for the audience. We are at a
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.480]   moment in time where this is moving very quickly. And you
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.160]   have very intelligent people here who are very knowledgeable.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.480]   Talking about the degree to which this is going to manifest
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.440]   itself, not if it will manifest, you are absolutely 100% certain
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.200]   freeberg that somebody will do something very bad in terms of
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.120]   the chemical example as but one, it we're only determining here
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.080]   what level of hardware and what year that will happen to Martha
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.400]   saying, we know it's going to happen, whether it's two or 10,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.400]   or, you know, five years, let's be thoughtful about it. And I
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.040]   think, you know, this discussion we're having here, I think is
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:45.080]   on a spectrum. It's this is a unique moment where the most
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.680]   knowledgeable people across every single political spectrum
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.280]   persuasion for profit, nonprofit, Democrat, Republican,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.320]   right, Elon and Sam, I'll just use those as the two canonical
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.600]   examples to demonstrate our pro regulation, and then the further
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.880]   and further you get away, the less technically astute you are,
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.360]   the more anti regulation and like pro market you are. And all
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.600]   I'm saying is, I think that should also be noted that that's
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.080]   a unique moment that the only other time that that's happened
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:18.120]   was around nuclear weapons. And you know, that's when I actually
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.520]   think, I think it's politically incorrect. Right now, I think
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.320]   because of what you're saying, just give me a second, I think
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.640]   because of what you're saying, everyone on the left and the
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.560]   right, it's it's become popular to be pro regulation on AI and
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.760]   say that AI is going to doom the world. And it's unpopular. And
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.240]   I'm saying,
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.960]   no, I'm saying,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.040]   I've explained my point of view on Sam, Elon's different, but I
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.080]   think like it, I think it's become politically incorrect to
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.480]   stand up and say, you know what, this is a transformative
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.400]   technology for humanity. I don't think that there's a real path
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.160]   to regulation. I think that there are totally there are laws
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.560]   that are in place that can protect us in other ways, with
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.640]   respect to privacy, with respect to fraud, with respect to
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.800]   biological warfare, and all the other things that we should
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.360]   worry about.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.120]   Elon has said pretty clearly, he doesn't give a shit about what
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.200]   it does to make money or not. He cares about what he thinks. So
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.920]   all I'm saying is that's a guy that's not trying to be
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.880]   politically correct.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.800]   Elon has a very specific concern, which is a GI, he's
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.400]   concerned that we're on a path to a digital super intelligence
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.040]   singularity. And if we create the wrong kind of artificial
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.720]   general intelligence that decides that it doesn't like
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.200]   humans, that is a real risk to the human species. That's the
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.800]   concern he's expressed. But that's not what the hearing was
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   really about. And it's not what any of these regulatory
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.880]   proposals are about. The reality is none of these centers know
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.440]   what to do about that even the industry doesn't know what to
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.920]   do about the long term risk of creating an AGI.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.760]   Nobody knows.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.960]   Nobody really. And so and so I actually I disagree with this
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.840]   idea that tomorrow, the early earlier you said that there's 1000
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.680]   use cases here that could destroy the human species. I
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:58.560]   think there's only one, there's only one species level risk,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.480]   which is AGI. But that's a long term risk. We don't know what to
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.680]   do about it yet. I agree, we should have conversations. What
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.360]   we're talking about today is whether we create some new
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.400]   licensure regime in Washington, so that politically connected
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.320]   insiders get to control and shape the software industry. And
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.080]   that's a disaster. Let me give you another detail on this. So
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.360]   in one of the chat groups, I'm in, there was somebody who just
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.480]   got back from Washington, I won't say who they are. It's not
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.280]   someone who's famous outside the industry, but they're kind of
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.560]   like a tech leader. And what they said is they just got back
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.040]   from Capitol Hill and the White House. And I guess there's like
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.520]   a White House summit on AI. You guys know about that? Yeah. So
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.000]   what this person said is that the White House meeting was
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.520]   super depressing. Some smart people were there to be sure,
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.520]   but the White House and VPS teams were rapidly negative, no
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.600]   real concern for the opportunity, or economic impact
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.640]   just super negative. Of course, basically, the mentality was
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.120]   that tech is bad. We hate social media. This is the hot new
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.000]   thing. We have to stop it. Of course, that basically is their
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.480]   attitude. They don't understand the technology White House.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.960]   Yeah, the Y and the VP specifically, because she's the
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.280]   now the AI is our to put Kamala Harris in charge of this makes
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.400]   no sense. I mean, does she have any background in this? Like it
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.960]   just shows like a complete utter lack of awareness. Where's the
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.520]   Megan Smith, or somebody like a CTO to be put in charge of
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.160]   this? Remember, Megan Smith was CTO under, I guess Obama, like,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.640]   you need somebody with a little more depth of experience here,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.280]   like hopefully,
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.200]   then you guys then saying you're you're pro regulation,
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.880]   depending on who's in charge.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.800]   Well, I'm pro thoughtfulness. I'm pro thoughtfulness. I'm
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:43.320]   illustrating that really, this whole new agency that's being
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.800]   discussed is just based on vibes. You're not down with the
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.120]   vibes.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.840]   The vibes
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:51.200]   are the vibes, the vibe is that a bunch of people in Washington
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.040]   don't understand technology, and they're afraid of it. So
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   anything you're afraid of, you're gonna want to control
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.240]   these are socialists, David, they're socialists. They hate
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.040]   progress. They are scared to death that jobs are going to
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.160]   collapse. They're socialists, they, they're union leaders.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.560]   This is their worst nightmare. Because the actual truth of
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.960]   this technology is 30% more efficiency, and it's very
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.680]   mundane. This is the truth here. I think that representatives
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.360]   have 30% more efficiency means Google, Facebook, and many other
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   companies, finance, education, they do not add staff every
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.320]   year, they just get 30% more efficient every year. And then
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.120]   we see unemployment go way up, and Americans are going to have
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.080]   to take service jobs. And white collar jobs are going to be
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.720]   refined to like a very elite few people who actually do work in
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.960]   the world. There is absolutely a lot of new companies. If humans
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.800]   can become if knowledge workers can become 30% more productive,
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.120]   there'll be a lot of new companies. And the biggest
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.800]   shortage our economy is coders, right? And we're going to have
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.560]   an unlimited number of them. Now. They're all going to go.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   Yeah, I don't know if it's unlimited. But yes, it's a good
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.280]   thing. If you give them superpowers. We've talked about
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.000]   this before. Yeah. So I think it's too soon to be concluding
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.880]   that we need to stop job displacement that hasn't even
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.360]   occurred yet. I'm not saying it's actually going to happen. I
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.000]   do agree, there'll be more startups. I'm seeing it
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.320]   already. I just think that's what they fear. That's their
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.560]   fear is and that's the fear of the EU, the EU is going to be
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.760]   protectionist unionist, protect pro workers, which is fine,
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.640]   they're gonna be affected because these are not blue
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.680]   collar jobs we're talking about. These are knowledge. There's
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.600]   white collar unions that all the media companies created unions
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.800]   and look at them. They're all going circling all these media
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.200]   companies are circling the training going. But that's on
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   the margins. I mean, that's not just trying to start tech
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.600]   unions. Sure, they're trying to start them. But when we think of
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.120]   unionized workers, you're thinking about factory workers,
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.200]   and these people are not affected.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.120]   Okay, listen, this has been an incredible debate. This is why
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.080]   you tune into the pod. A lot of things can be true at the same
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.800]   time. I really think the analogy of the the atom bomb is really
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.880]   interesting, because what you want is scared about with
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.000]   general artificial intelligence is nuclear holocaust, the whole
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.600]   planet blows up. Between those two things are things like
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.560]   Nagasaki and Hiroshima or a dirty bomb and many other
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.960]   possibilities with nuclear power, you know, Fukushima, you
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.040]   know, etc. So let's
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.320]   send no Hiroshima.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.880]   Not yet. Right. And you know, the question is, is a three mile
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.920]   island is a Fukushima is a Nagasaki are those things
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.080]   probable. And I think we are all looking at this saying there
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.360]   will be something bad that will happen. There will be the
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.760]   equivalent. All right.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.480]   It strings together and these large language models string
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.560]   together words in really interesting ways. And they give
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.160]   computers the ability to have a natural language interface that
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:34.640]   is so far from AGI. I think it's a component. Hold on, I think
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.400]   it's a obviously the ability to understand language and
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:41.840]   communicate in a natural way is a component of a future AGI. But
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.640]   by itself, these are models for stringing together
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:49.080]   auto GPT, where these things go out and pursue things without
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.840]   any interference, I would be the first one to say that if you
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.920]   wanted to scope models to be able to just do human language
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:02.320]   back and forth on the broad open internet, you know, there's
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.280]   probably a form David where these chat GPT products can
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.080]   exist. I don't I think that those are quite benign. I agree
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.400]   with you. But I think what Jason is saying is that every week
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.760]   you're you're taking a leap forward. And already with auto
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.240]   GPT is you're talking about code that runs in the background
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.120]   without supervision. It's not a human interface that's like,
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.440]   hey, show me how to color my cookies green for St. Patty's
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.320]   Day. It's a plan my trip to Italy. Yeah, yeah, it's not
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.240]   doing that. So I just think that there's there's a place well
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.000]   beyond what you're talking about. And I think you're
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.920]   minimizing the problem a little bit by just kind of saying the
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.160]   whole class of AI is just chat GPT and asking, kid asking it to
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.040]   help it with its home.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.240]   This example, I hate to say it out loud. But somebody could say
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.240]   here is the history of financial crimes that were committed and
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.840]   other hacks, please with their own model on their own server,
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.360]   say, please come up with other ideas for hacks, be as creative
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.960]   as possible and steal as much money as possible and put that
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.800]   in an auto GPT, David, and study all hacks that occur in the
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.160]   history of hacking. And it could just create super chaos around
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:05.640]   the world.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.320]   And you can be sure history is going to regret buying into this
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.080]   narrative because the members of the Judiciary Committee are
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.320]   doing the same playbook they ran back in 2016. After that
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.720]   election, they ran all these hearings on disinformation,
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.400]   claiming that social networks been used to hack the election.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   It was all a phony narrative. Hold on that. What happened?
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.800]   They got tech companies to buy into Biden, they Russians hacked
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.920]   Hunter right after that. Stop, they got they got all these tech
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.240]   CEOs to buy into that phony narrative. Why? Because it's a
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.560]   lot easier for the tech CEOs to agree and tell the senators what
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.200]   they want to hear to get them off their backs. And then what
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.320]   does that lead to a whole censorship industrial complex.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.240]   So we're going to do the same thing here. We're going to buy
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.960]   into these phony narratives to get the senators off our backs.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.080]   And that's going to create this giant AI industrial complex
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.880]   that's going to slow down real innovation and be a burden on
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.440]   entrepreneurs.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.600]   Okay, lightning round lightning round. We got to move on three
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.200]   more topics I want to hit. Let's keep going.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.920]   If honored to become an evil more evil. Yeah. What is it
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.080]   called an evil comic book character? A supervillain, a
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.520]   supervillain. I would you want to be an even more loathsome
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.360]   supervillain continue, I would take every single virus patch
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.800]   that's been developed and publicized, learn on them and
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.160]   then find the next zero day exploit on a whole bunch of
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.400]   stuff. I mean, it's like even publish that idea. Please don't
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.880]   I mean, I'm worried about publishing that idea. That's
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.280]   not an intellectual leap. I mean, you have to be an hour.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.680]   Obvious. Okay, let's move on. Another great debate. Elon hired
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.840]   a CEO for Twitter. Linda yakarino. I'm hoping pronouncing
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.440]   that correct was the head of ad sales at NBC Universal. She's a
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:43.760]   legend in the advertising business. She worked at Turner
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.840]   for 15 years before that she is a workaholic is what she says
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.240]   she's going to take over everything but product and CTO
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:57.040]   Elon's gonna stick with that. She seems to be very moderate
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.400]   and she follows people on the left or right people are
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.640]   starting the character assassination and trying to
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.800]   figure out her politics. She was involved with the WF World
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.400]   Economic Forum, which anybody in business basically does. But
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:16.360]   your take sacks on this choice for CEO and what this means just
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.160]   broadly for the next six months because we're sitting here at
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.040]   six months almost exactly since you on took over obviously you
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.480]   and I were involved in month one but but not much after that.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   What do you think the next six months holds and what do you
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.840]   think her role is going to be obviously some precedent this
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.120]   for this with you know, when at SpaceX?
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.400]   Listen, I think this choice makes sense on this level
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.960]   Twitter's business model is advertising. Elon does not like
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.200]   selling advertising. She's really good at selling
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.640]   advertising. So he's chosen a CEO to work with who's highly
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:52.000]   complimentary to him in their skill sets and interests. And I
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.640]   think that makes sense. I think there's a lot of logic in that
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.240]   what Elon likes doing is the technology and product side of
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:03.880]   the business. He actually doesn't really like the let's
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.600]   call it the standard business chores. And especially related
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.720]   to like we said advertising and he loves to offer that stuff.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.440]   Advertisers make is his personal nightmare. Right? So I think the
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.040]   choice makes sense on that level. Now. Instantly, you're
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.360]   right, her hiring led to attacks from both the left and the right
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:27.160]   the right, you know, pointed out her views on COVID and vaccines
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.560]   and her work with the WF. And on the left, I mean, the attack is
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.840]   that she's following lives at Tick Tock, which you're just not
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.040]   allowed to do apparently,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.920]   a follow is not an endorsement.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.320]   Well, if you're just following lives to tick tock, they want to
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.000]   say you're some crazy right winger now.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.280]   Well, she also follows David Sachs. So that does mean that
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   she's pretty that that is a signal. But the truth is, if
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.360]   Sachs correct me if I'm wrong here, or trim off, maybe I'll
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.800]   send it to you. If you pick somebody that both sides
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.320]   dislike or trying to take apart, you probably picked the right
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:54.920]   person. Yeah.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.320]   Here's what I think. Okay, go ahead. We're not going to know
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.200]   how good she is for six to nine months. But here's what I took a
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:10.440]   lot of joy out of. Here's a guy who gets attacked for all kinds
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.800]   of things now, right? He's an anti Semite, apparently. And then
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.720]   he had to be like, I'm very pro Semite. He's a guy that all of
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.200]   a sudden people think is a conspiracy theorist. He's a guy
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.080]   that people think is now on the raging right, all these things
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.280]   that are just like inaccuracies, basically firebombs thrown by
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.440]   the left. But here's what I think is the most interesting
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.560]   thing for a guy that theoretically is supposed to be a
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.480]   troll and everything else. He has a female chairman at Tesla,
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:42.560]   a female CEO at Twitter, and a female president at SpaceX. Of
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.240]   course, it's a great insight. It's the same insight. I think a
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.160]   lot of these virtue signaling lunatics on the left virtue
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:53.120]   signaling mids. They're all nice. And you know, like, you
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.920]   have Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, giving, you know, the
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:04.480]   CEO of Starbucks a hard time when he doubled the pay of the
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.440]   minimum wage, gave them a free bird. You love mid right? That's
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:13.240]   a great term, isn't it? These fucking meds and I paid for the
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:17.280]   college tuition. What gives you the right at Starbucks to pay
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.680]   for college tuition and double the minimum wage? That's so so
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.000]   mad. I don't know why it's so funny to me.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.520]   Isn't it so great? Like, you can picture them when I say that
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.080]   these are these mids feverishly typing on their keyboards, their
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.480]   virtue signaling nonsense, sex wrapping it up.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   Yeah, look, like you said, Elon has worked extremely well with
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.680]   when shot well, who's the president of SpaceX for a long
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:44.240]   time. And I think that relationship shows the way to
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.280]   make it work here at Twitter, which is they have a very
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.640]   commoner skill set. I think my understanding is that when
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.280]   focuses on the business side and the sales side of the operation,
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   Elon focuses on product and technology. She lets Elon be
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.200]   Elon. I think if Linda tries to reign Elon in, tell him not to
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.040]   tweet, or tries to meddle in the free speech aspects of the
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.720]   business, which is the whole reason he bought Twitter, which
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.400]   is the beginning and end of it. Yeah, that's right. That's when
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.760]   it will fall apart. So my advice would be let Elon be Elon. You
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.640]   know, he bought this company to make it a free speech platform.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.680]   Don't mess with that. And I think it could work great. And
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.600]   a free speech platform. It is when you are saying anything
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.000]   about COVID. And I really don't even want to say it here,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.240]   because I don't want our to even say the word COVID or vaccine
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.400]   means that this could get tagged by YouTube and be D. You know,
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:37.840]   algorithm, the algorithm could could could D. I don't know what
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.360]   they call it deprecate this and when we don't show up and people
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.640]   don't see us because we just said the word COVID. I mean, the
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.480]   censorship built into these algorithms is absurd. But
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.160]   speaking of absurd, Lena Khan, who has been the least effective
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.660]   FTC chair, I think, started out pretty promising with some
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.640]   interesting ideas. She's now moved to block a major pharma
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.980]   deal. In December, Amgen agreed to acquire Dublin based horizon
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.040]   therapeutic for 27.8 billion. This is the largest pharma deal
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.920]   announced in 2022. FTC has filed a lawsuit in federal court
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.600]   seeking an injunction that would prevent the deal from closing.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.860]   The reasoning is the deal would allow Amgen to entrench the
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.680]   monopoly positions of horizons I and gout drugs. The agency said
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.840]   that those treatments don't face any competition today and that
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.840]   Amgen would have a strong incentive to prevent any
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.880]   potential rivals from introducing similar drugs.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.080]   Chamath the pharmaceutical industry is a little bit
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:32.800]   different than the tech
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.080]   here insanity.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.680]   Explain why and then sacks will go to you on the gout stuff.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.520]   Well, I know that personally impacts you. Go ahead.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.960]   I think that this is a little like scientifically illiterate,
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.600]   to be honest. Unpack the thing is that you want drugs that can
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   get to market quickly. But at the same time, you want drugs to
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.480]   be safe, and you want drugs to be effective. And I think that
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:00.360]   the FDA has a pretty reasonable process. And one of the direct
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.040]   byproducts of that process is that if you have a large
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.540]   indication that you're going after, say diabetes, you have to
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.440]   do an enormous amount of work, it has to be run on effectively
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.700]   1000s of people, you have to stratify it by age, you have to
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:16.960]   stratify it by gender, you have to stratify by race, you have to
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.720]   do it across different geographies, right? The bar is
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.580]   high. But the reason the bar is high is that if you do get
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.660]   approval, these all of a sudden become these blockbuster 1020
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:31.040]   $30 billion drugs, okay. And they improve people's lives, and
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.200]   they allow people to live, etc, etc. What has happened in the
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.480]   last 10 or 15 years, because of Wall Street's influence inside
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:45.440]   of the pharma companies, is that what pharma has done a very good
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:51.320]   job of doing is actually pushing off a lot of this very risky R&D
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:56.080]   to young early stage biotech companies. And they typically do
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.720]   the first part of the work, they get through a phase one, they
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.640]   even may be able to sometimes go and start a phase two trial to a
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:09.080]   trial. And then they typically can get sold to pharma. And
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.920]   these are like multi billion dollar transactions. And the
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.160]   reason is that the private markets just don't have the
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.040]   money to support the risk for these companies to be able to do
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.260]   all the way through a phase three clinical trial because it
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:26.080]   would cost on some cases 5678 billion dollars. You've never
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.520]   heard of a tech company raising that much money except in a few
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.080]   rare cases. In far in biotech, it just doesn't happen. So you
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.200]   need the M&A machine to be able to incentivize these young
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.800]   companies to even get started in the first place. Otherwise, what
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:44.520]   literally happens is you have a whole host of diseases that just
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.920]   stagnate. Okay. And instead, what happens is a younger
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:53.000]   company can only raise money to go after smaller diseases, which
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.040]   have smaller populations, smaller revenue potential,
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:00.200]   smaller costs, because the trial infrastructure is just less. So
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.080]   if you don't want industry to be in this negative loop, where you
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.720]   only work on the small diseases, and you actually go and tackle
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.160]   the big ones, you need to allow these kinds of transactions
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.720]   happen. The last thing I'll say is that even when these big
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.480]   transactions happen, half the time they turn out to still not
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.120]   work, there is still huge risk. So don't get caught up in the
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.800]   dollar size. You have to understand the phase it's in.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.120]   And the best example of this is the biggest outcome in in
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.160]   biotech private investing in Silicon Valley was this thing
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.200]   called stem centric. And that thing was a $10 billion dud,
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.760]   right. But it allowed all these other companies to get started
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.880]   after some centric Scott bought for 10 billion.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.640]   Freiburg, I want to get your take on this, especially in
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.520]   light of maybe something people don't understand, which is that
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.680]   the amount of time you get to actually exclusively monetize a
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.520]   drug, because my understanding you correct me if I'm wrong, you
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.320]   get a 20 year patent, it's from the date you file it, but then
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.840]   you're working towards getting this drug approved by the FDA.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.920]   So by the time the FDA approves the drug, this 20 year patent
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.880]   window, how many years do you actually have exclusively to
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.000]   monetize that drug? And then your wider thoughts on this?
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   FTA? Yeah, I'm not going to answer that question right now.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.960]   Because I do want to kind of push back on the point I'm
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.240]   generally pretty negative on a lot of the comments Lena
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.760]   contemade and her positioning. And obviously, as you guys know,
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:22.480]   we've talked about it on the show. But I read the FTC filing
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:28.040]   written federal court. And if you read the filing, let me just
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.800]   start the company that am gens trying to buy it's called
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.000]   horizon therapeutics, which is a company that's doing about 4
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.360]   billion in revenue a year about a billion to a billion and a
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.200]   half in EBITDA. So it's a it's a business that's got a portfolio
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.240]   of orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat orphan conditions
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.320]   that aren't very big blockbusters in the in the
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.480]   pharmaceutical drug context. And so it's a it's a nice portfolio
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:53.320]   of cash generating drugs. And Jen, buying the business gives
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.920]   them real revenue really, but and helps bolster a portfolio
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.240]   that you know, is aging. And I think that's a big part of the
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.920]   strategic driver for am Jen to make this massive $28 billion
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:10.200]   acquisition, the FTC is claim in the filing, which I actually
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.840]   read and I was like, this is actually a pretty good claim is
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.760]   that the way that am Jen sets the prices for their
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.720]   pharmaceutical drugs is they go to the insurance companies, the
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.160]   payers and the health systems, and they negotiate drug pricing.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.760]   And they often do bulk multi product deals. So they'll say,
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.320]   hey, we'll give you access to the product at this price point,
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.800]   but we need you to pay this price point for this product. And
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.160]   over time, that drives price inflation, it drives costs up.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.680]   And it also makes it difficult for new competitors to emerge.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.400]   Because they tell the insurance company, you have to pick our
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:46.520]   drug over other drugs in order to get this discounted price. And
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.520]   so it's a big part of their negotiating strategy that they
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:52.080]   do with insurance companies. So the FTC is claim is that by
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.240]   giving am Jen this large portfolio of drugs that they're
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.040]   buying from horizon, it's going to give them more negotiating
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.880]   leverage and the ability to do more of this drug blocking that
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.920]   they do with insurance companies and other payers in the drug
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.760]   system. So they're trying to prevent pharmaceutical drug
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.280]   price inflation, and they're trying to increase competition
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.040]   in their lawsuit. So I felt like it was a fairly kind of
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.600]   compelling case. I'm no lawyer on antitrust and monopolistic
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.680]   practices and the Sherman Act. But this was not sorry, let me
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.160]   just say this was not an early stage biotech risky deal that
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.080]   they're trying to block. No, it is a mature company with
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.280]   4 billion in revenue and a billion and a half in EBITDA. I
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.440]   understand. And I read it too. But two comments. It is because
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.200]   the people that traffic in these stocks are the same ones that
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.160]   fund these early stage biotech companies. And I talked to a
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.680]   bunch of them. And they're like, if these guys block this kind of
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.560]   deal, we're going to get out of this game entirely. So just from
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.320]   the horse's mouth, what I'm telling you is you're going to
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.640]   see a Paul come over the early stage venture financing
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.280]   landscape, because a lot of these guys that are crossover
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.880]   investors that own a lot of these public biotech stocks that
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.480]   also fund the private stocks will change their risk posture
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.360]   if they can't make money. That's just the nature of capitalism.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.680]   The second thing is Lena Khan did something really good about
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.280]   what you're talking about this week, actually, which is she
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.600]   actually went after the PBMs. And if you really care about
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.800]   drug inflation, and you follow the dollars, the real culprits
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.160]   around this are the pharmacy benefit managers. And she
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.960]   actually launched a big investigation into them. But
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.720]   this is what speaks to the two different approaches. It seems
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.080]   that unfortunately, for the FTC, every merger just gets contested
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.280]   for the sake of it being contested. Because I think that
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.920]   if you wanted to actually stop price inflation, there are
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.280]   totally different mechanisms. Because why didn't you just sue
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:39.000]   all the PBMs? Well, there's no merger to be done. But you can
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.040]   investigate, and then you could regulate. And I think that
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.640]   that's probably a more effective way. And the fact that she
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.240]   targeted the PBM says that somebody in there actually
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.520]   understands where the price inflation is coming from. But I
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.560]   don't think something like an Amgen horizon, because what I
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.640]   think will happen is all the folks will then just basically
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.720]   say, Well, man, if if, if these kinds of things can't get
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.040]   bought, then why am I funding these other younger things? Yeah,
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:02.440]   but you know,
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   yeah, we're just not seeing a lot of the younger stuff get
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.920]   get blocked. I don't think we've seen any attempts at blocking
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.360]   speculative portfolio acquisitions or speculative
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.560]   company acquisitions. So
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.800]   I think these guys are getting caught up in the dollar number.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.160]   You know, yeah. So I think the problem is they see 28 billion,
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.760]   they're like, we need to stop it. You know, it's amazing. I'll
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.840]   just wrap on this, because it's a good discussion. But I think
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.320]   we got to keep moving here is I took the PDF that you shared.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:32.960]   And I put it into chat GPT now. Oh, and you don't need to upload
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.600]   the PDF anymore. You could just say summarize this and put the
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.080]   link. And it did it instantly.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.240]   Are using the browsing plugin or
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.400]   I just use it. No, it's not the browser plugin. I just did. This
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.240]   is the game. But 3.5 model, I just gave it a link and it
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:51.360]   pulled the link in the GPT 3.5 model does know we could do
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.960]   that. That's new. They must add a browsing in the background.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.560]   Yeah, or just pulling it. They did today, by the way. Whoa.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:02.000]   They did it today. Yeah. Well, remember last week, we said that
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.080]   they had to build browsing into the actual product like bard,
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   right? Otherwise, it can move. And I got to say, closed AI
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.760]   closed AI is on the top of their game. The app is available in
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.080]   the apps are now right as of today. No, they they had a test
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.560]   app. I was on the test. No, no, no, they just launched the app.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.520]   Today. Oh, that's game over, man. If this thing is an app
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.880]   form, that's going to 10 x the number of users and it's going
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.880]   to 10 x the amount of usage. The same thing for bard, we should
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.680]   compare the two but bard bard is pretty good as well. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.320]   Well, bring you out to actually compare its summary with chat
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:37.720]   GPT summary. Tell us which one's better. Right? This is some
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.880]   interesting news here. You know, we speaking of platform shifts,
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.200]   do I get to give my view on the Lena con thing?
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:49.160]   Oh, well, yes. But first, I don't want to read this was
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.920]   getting a little, it was getting a little personal here, David.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.720]   And I didn't I didn't want to trigger you. I know you've been
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.920]   struggling with the gout. Because of your lifestyle
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.840]   choices, the alcohol, the foie gras everything, but now you've
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.360]   lost a lot of way to give you a lot of credit. Tell us what do
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.200]   you think about the bundling we're seeing here? Because it
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.400]   does seem Microsoft s with the operating system. Yeah, it's
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.480]   very similar. And what I said in the context of tech is that we
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.880]   should focus on the anti competitive tactics and stop
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.360]   those rather than blocking all mergers. And I think the same
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.120]   thing is happening now in the pharma space. If bundling is
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.360]   the problem focus on bundling. The problem when you just block
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:27.520]   M&A is that you deny early investors, one of the biggest
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.200]   ways that they can make a positive outcome. And what's the
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.800]   downstream effect of that? Yeah, exactly. Look, it is hard enough
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:38.000]   to make money as either a pharma investor or as a VC, that
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.240]   there's only two good outcomes, right? There's IPOs, there's
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.400]   M&A, everything else basically goes, everything else is a zero
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:48.800]   goes bankrupt. So if you take M&A off the table, you really
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.720]   suppress the already challenged returns of venture capital.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.840]   Yeah, well said well said.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.520]   And you're right, you mentioned earlier that we were willing to
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.520]   give Lena Khan a chance. We thought that some of our ideas
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.000]   were really interesting, because I think there are these huge
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.880]   tech companies that do need to be regulated these big tech
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.720]   monopolies, basically that you have the mobile operating system
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.600]   duopoly with Apple and Google, you've got Amazon, you've got
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.760]   Microsoft, and there is a huge risk of those companies
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.800]   preferring their own applications over downstream
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.520]   applications or using these bundling tactics. Yes. If you
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.280]   don't put some limits around that, that creates I think, an
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.960]   unhealthy tech ecosystem.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.800]   This is the insight. And I think it's exactly correct sex. For
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.560]   Lena Khan, and if she listens to the pod, hey, Lena, you want
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.920]   to go after tactics, not acquisitions. So if somebody
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.520]   buys something, and they lower prices and increases consumer
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.840]   choice, that's great. If it encourages more people to
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.600]   invest more money into innovation, that's great. But if
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.160]   the tactics are we're going to bundle these drugs together to
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.000]   keep some number of them artificially high or reduced
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.880]   choice, or if we're going to bundle features into the you
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.920]   know, suite of products, and we do anti competitive stuff, you
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.280]   have to look at the tactics on the field are people cheating?
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.560]   And are they using the monopoly power to force you to use their
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.880]   app store? Just make Apple have a second app store. That's all
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.320]   we're asking you to do. There should be an app store on iOS
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.680]   that doesn't charge any fees or charges 1% fees. Break the
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.800]   monopoly on the app store.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.040]   Saks is so right. Perfectly said, she actually did issue
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.400]   compulsory orders to the PBMs. So to your point, Saks, the FTC
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.840]   has been worried that what freeberg said has been
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.240]   happening. But the real sort of middleman manipulator in this
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.400]   market are the pharmacy benefit managers. And so this week, she
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.880]   actually issued compulsory orders to the PBMs and said,
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.240]   Turn over all your business records to me, I'm going to look
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.320]   into them. That makes a ton of sense. But then on the same end,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.280]   it's like you see merger and you're like, No, it can't
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.200]   happen. It just doesn't speak to a knowledge of the market.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.040]   We should have Lena on with the Halina. I know you listen to the
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.200]   pod. I've heard the back channel just come on the pod. I should
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.120]   be a good guest, right? We would have a good conversation. I
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.640]   think. Yeah. Open invite Nikki Halley is coming on the pod. By
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.080]   the way, you have homework to do for the summit, which is to
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.240]   see if you can get Donald Trump to come on to the summit. Okay,
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.400]   huge. Love J. Cal. Love all in great. Okay.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.880]   Cute. Okay, not as good as apprentice but class. Okay,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.480]   great.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.240]   As your your mannerisms are unbelievable. How did you
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.560]   practice it? I did I did a little bit only because I like
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.680]   to show people and trigger them. I'm going to really dial in my
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.520]   Trump in the coming weeks. All right, here we go. Apple's long
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.680]   anticipated a our headset that stands for augmented reality,
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.760]   which means VR, you can't see the real world, you're just in a
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.600]   virtual world AR lets you put digital assets on the real
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600]   world. So you can see what's happening in the real world. But
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.800]   you can put graphics all around that's expected to be revealed.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:55.360]   As early as June, the projected cost is going to be around
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.080]   $3,000. It won't ship into the fall. This is a break from
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:03.040]   Apple's typical way of releasing products, which is to wait till
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.800]   it's perfect and to wait until all consumers can afford it.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.640]   This is a different approach. They're going to give this out
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.760]   to developers early. And Tim Cook is supposedly pushing this
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.240]   there was another group of people inside of Apple who did
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.600]   not want to release a Chema. But there is some sort of external
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.440]   battery pack, it seems like a bit of a Franken product
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:26.120]   Frankenstein kind of project here. That, you know, perhaps
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.480]   Steve Jobs wouldn't have wanted to release but he needs to get
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.840]   it out. I think because Oculus is making so much progress to
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.320]   killer app supposedly is a FaceTime like live chat
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:38.000]   experience that seems interesting, but they look like
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.200]   ski goggles. Your thoughts Chamath on this as the next
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.200]   compute platform if they can get it, you know to work would you
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.920]   wear these? Would they have to be Prada? What's the story? No,
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.320]   no,
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.240]   this seemed like a weird conversation because none of us
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.280]   fucking know none of us have seen this product and none of us
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.160]   have used it. So like, this is just lucky friend of the pot
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.640]   poma. Lucky says it's incredible.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.320]   So what that's just like commenting on one guy's five
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.400]   letter five word tweet.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.920]   Let's Palmer knows I mean, Palmer invented Oculus.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.760]   Great. What are we talking about? We have nothing to say
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.040]   to that.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.800]   I'll a form of really good question here. Do you believe
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.720]   this is going to be a meaningful compute platform in the coming
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.680]   years because Apple is so good at product? How do we know till
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.800]   we see it? We got to see it. I think on Facebook, of course,
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.920]   they're of course they're good at product. Let's let's see the
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.760]   product though. Like,
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.480]   all right, fine. Saks, what are your thoughts?
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.880]   I think it's a good thing that they're launching this. Like you
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.200]   said, it is a deviation for what they've normally done. They
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.520]   normally don't release a product unless they believe the entire
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.080]   world can use it. So their approach has been only to
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.200]   release mass mass market products and have a very small
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.240]   portfolio of those products. But when those products work,
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.920]   they're, you know, billion user home runs. This obviously can't
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.960]   be at a $3,000 price point. And it also seems like it's a little
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.000]   bit of a early prototype where the batteries are like in a
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.440]   fanny pack around your waist. And there's a ways to go around
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.800]   this, but I give them credit for launching what is probably going
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.440]   to be more of an early prototype so they can start iterating on
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.960]   it. I mean, the reality is the Apple watch the first version
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.320]   kind of sucked and first five versions. Yeah, now they're on
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.840]   one that's pretty good, I think. So look, I think this is a cool
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.160]   new platform. They get knocked on for not innovating enough. I
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.120]   think good, let them try something new. I think this will
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.720]   be good for meta to have some competition. Yeah, it's great.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.160]   Having two major players in the race, maybe it actually speeds
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.240]   up the innovation. I mean, we get some work.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.680]   She wants any of that here. I mean, I think they should have
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.800]   done something in cars. I agree with David, like they do in
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.120]   cars. Well, if you were going to talk about the car, what would
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.760]   it be? Tell me what you think would be the right approach you
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.880]   were going to do the Facebook phone that could have changed
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.000]   the entire destiny of Facebook, they should have bought Tesla
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.200]   when they could have the chance for four or $5 billion. They
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.920]   could have bought it for 10 billion 20 billion. And when it
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.880]   got to 5060 that it got out of reach. What do you think the car
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.400]   should know they could have bought it at 100 billion. It
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.600]   could have bought 100 billion Tim Cook famously wouldn't take
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.760]   the meeting. Elon said it he wouldn't he wouldn't meet was
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.000]   our bizarre.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.680]   Maybe they missed an opportunity there. But I do think the end
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.640]   game with the AR headset or glasses, right? Yes. Where you
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.920]   get the screens and you get the Terminator mode. And in is that
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.560]   what is that?
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.120]   These are just glasses that
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:19.040]   were like fancy technology. This this size glasses is what you're
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.000]   talking about. Yeah, like a little camera built in and
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.240]   conjunction with AI, then it gets really interesting. So
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.600]   that that's the end game here. I think
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.720]   give the audience an example of what this combination of AI plus
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.560]   AR could do
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.960]   when you're walking around, it could layer on intelligence
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.880]   about the world or you meet with somebody and it can remind you
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.240]   of their name and the last time you met with them and give you a
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.600]   summary of what you talked about. What action items there
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:42.960]   are.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.600]   You can be walking in a city and it could tell you it knows you
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.800]   like Peking duck, it could show you Hey, there's a Peking duck
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.080]   place over here. Some reviews have it just knows you and it's
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:51.960]   customized in the world.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.920]   What about for people that do the same routine 99% of the time
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.880]   how does it can help you that
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.200]   it could tell you your steps every day could tell you
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.880]   incoming messages so you don't have to take your
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.400]   $3,000 on that. No, but you would spend people spend plus
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.120]   your people spend $400 on notifications on your wrist. Why
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.600]   do you want it on your eyes for 3000? I would love this.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.000]   Maybe I just do like a lot of meetings or I'm at events where
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.280]   people are coming up to me and I've met him like once a year
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.440]   before. Like it would be really helpful to kind of have the
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.360]   term. Let's be honest, though, the terminated mode for you to
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.320]   be able to be present with your family and friends, but be
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.000]   playing chess with Peter Thiel on those glasses. That's your
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.520]   dream come true. You and Peter in a are playing chess all day
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:39.480]   long. Throw up the picture of sacks beating Peter Thiel. I
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.400]   watched the clip from the early all in episodes when we
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.760]   discussed you beating Peter Thiel. What a great moment it
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.600]   was for you. All right, listen, let's wrap up with this gallop
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.360]   survey the number of Americans who say it's a good time to
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:55.480]   buy a house has never been lower 21% say it's a good time to buy
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.520]   a house down 9% from the prior low of a year ago prior to
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.320]   2022 50% or more consistently thought it was a good time to
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:07.120]   buy significantly significantly fewer expect local housing
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.360]   prices to increase in the year. Hey, sacks is this like a
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.720]   predictive of a bottom and pure capitulation and then that means
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.880]   maybe it is in fact a good time. How would you read this data?
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.120]   I don't see it as a bottom necessarily the way I read the
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.680]   data is that the spike in interest rates have made it very
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.040]   unaffordable to buy a house right now you've got you know,
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.520]   the mortgages are what like 7% interest rate or even slightly
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.360]   higher. So people just can't afford the same level of house
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.720]   that they did before. I mean, mortgages were at three, three
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.800]   and a half percent like a year and a half ago. Now I think
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.840]   what's kind of interesting is that even in the 1980s, the
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:50.360]   early 1980s, when interest rates were at like 15%, you still had
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.120]   50% thought it was an okay time to buy a house or attractive
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.000]   time to buy a house. So for the number to be this low tells me
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.600]   that is not just about interest rates, I think consumer
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.480]   confidence is also plummeting, and people are feeling more
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:11.160]   insecure. So I think it's just another economic indicator that
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.960]   things are looking really shaky right now. And I'll tell you one
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.720]   of the the knock on effects of this is going to be that people
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.160]   can't move. Because in order to move, you have to sell your
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.360]   current house, and then buy a new one. And you're not going to
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.800]   want to sell your current house when prices are going down. And
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.760]   then for the new one, you're going to lose your 3% mortgage
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.360]   and have to get a new one at 7%. So you're not gonna buy
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.160]   anything like the house. So it freezes the market, it freezes
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.720]   mobility. I think over the last few years, during COVID, you saw
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.800]   tremendous movement between states, I think that's gonna
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.520]   slow down a lot now, because people just can't afford to
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.640]   trade houses. So as a result of that, I think discontent is
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.320]   going to rise. Because I think one of the ways that you create
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.600]   a pressure valve is when people are unhappy in a state, they
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.320]   just move somewhere else. Well, now they're not going to do
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.960]   that. Well, you can also move to a better opportunity for you and
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.680]   your family, whether that schools, taxes, a job,
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.080]   lifestyle. So yeah, you can you can, you're going to reduce joy
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.100]   in the country. And it also, it screws with price discovery,
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.800]   doesn't it? Your mouth if you if you don't have a fluid market
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.840]   here, then how does anybody know what their house is worth? And
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.120]   this just, again, creates more, I think, frost,
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.840]   I think Friedberg has said this a couple times, Friedberg, you
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.280]   can correct me if I'm wrong. But like the the home is like the
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.080]   disproportionate majority of most Americans wealth, right?
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.600]   It's all their wealth.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:36.960]   All their wealth. Yeah. So I mean, there's that factoid.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.200]   Yeah. And then what does that do for their attention savings or
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.280]   whatever? It's okay. You got incoming what's going on?
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.160]   They're bringing you lunch?
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.760]   No, I was looking I was looking at a mansion that's for sale.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:54.720]   Like $175 million, but they just got the price to 140. So I'm
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.160]   just taking a little again. I mean,
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.880]   there's gonna be a lot of distress in the market soon. I'm
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.040]   predicting a lot of distress. Actually, can we shift to the
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.840]   commercial side for a second? I just passed away. Yeah. Sam
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.280]   Zell passed away. Today. Oh, wow. Rest in peace. Yeah. Rest in
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.560]   peace. Chicago. Yeah, crazy. But speaking of bastic, interesting
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.080]   guy. Yeah. But speaking of the real estate market, so I want to
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.640]   give an update on San Francisco, Siri, I was talking to a broker
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.720]   the other day. And so here are the stats that they gave me. So
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.840]   it was a local broker than someone from Blackstone. And
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.760]   they're fans of the pod and just came up to me, we started
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.760]   talking about what's happening in San Francisco. Shout out to
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.160]   them. Didn't take a didn't take a photo. But But in any event,
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.080]   they're they're fans of the pod. So we started talking about
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:43.000]   what's happening in San Francisco, real estate. So the
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.440]   SF office market is just a level set is 90 million square feet,
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.000]   they said the vacancy rate is now 35%. So that's over 30
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.880]   million square feet vacant, and vacancy still growing as leases
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.280]   end, and companies shed space because some of that space that
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.200]   they're not using is not for sublease. Everyone says what
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.640]   about AI is AI going to be the savior? The problem is that AI
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.320]   companies are only that's only about a million square feet of
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.480]   demand. So 1 million out of 30 million is going to be absorbed
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.440]   by AI. And you know, maybe that number grows over time over the
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   next 510 years as we create some really big AI companies, but it's
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.040]   just not going to bail out San Francisco right now. The other
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.360]   thing is that, you know, VC backed startups are very
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.120]   demanding in terms of their tenant improvements, and
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.440]   landlords don't really have the capital right now to put that
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:33.320]   into the buildings. And startups just are not the kind of credit
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.720]   worthy tenants that landlords really want. So this is not
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.600]   going to bail anybody out there. They said there are a ton of
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.800]   zombie office towers, especially in Soma. And all these office
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.600]   towers are eventually gonna be owned by the banks, which you're
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.280]   gonna have to liquidate them. And then we're gonna find out
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.080]   that these loans that they made are gonna have to be written off.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.280]   Because the collateral that they thought was blue chip, that was
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.800]   backing up those loans is not so blue chip anymore. So I think
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.680]   we've got not just a huge commercial real estate problem,
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.120]   but it's gonna be a big banking problem as basically people
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.240]   stop pretending, you know, right now, they're trying to
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.280]   restructure loans, it's called pretend and extend, you reduce
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.320]   the rate on the loan, but add term to it. But that only works
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.160]   for so long. If this keeps going, if the market keeps
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.160]   looking like this, I think you're gonna have a real
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.440]   problem. And that will be a problem in the banking system.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.000]   Now, San Francisco is the worst of the worst. But they said that
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.400]   New York is similar. And all these other big cities with empty
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.920]   office towers are directionally.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.880]   I'm in New York right now for the side connections conference.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.880]   And it is packed, the city is packed, getting anywhere,
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.840]   there's gridlock, you can't walk down the street, you got to walk
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.600]   around people every restaurant, it is dynamic. And then I talked
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.640]   to people about offices. And they said, people are staying in
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.080]   their houses and their tiny little New York apartments,
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.640]   instead of going three train stops to their office, they go
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.920]   to the office one or two days a week, unless you're like JP
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.280]   Morgan, or some other places that's the drop the boom. But
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.720]   there's a lot of people still working from home, the finance
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.880]   people have all gone back media people are starting to go back.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.240]   So there are three to five days here. And the city is booming.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.920]   Contrast that I spent the last two weeks in San Francisco,
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.760]   walking from Soma to the Embarcadero back dead, nobody in
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.760]   the city. It's like literally a ghost town. It's a real shame.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.840]   It's a real, real shame. I wonder if these this is the
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.480]   question I have for you, Saks. Can they cut a deal? Can they go
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.720]   to like month to month ran sub lats? You know, Lucy, Lucy, just
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.200]   give people any dollar amount to convince them to come back? Is
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.520]   there any dollar amount because I'm looking for a space for the
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.640]   incubator in San Mateo, I've been getting a ton of inbound,
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.240]   but the prices are still really high. And I'm like, how do I cut
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:51.160]   a deal here? Because shouldn't people be lowering the prices
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.280]   dramatically? Or just pretending or will I get a lower
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.520]   rates are definitely coming down big time, especially for space
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.640]   that sort of commodity and not that desirable. But what's
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.520]   happening is, according to the people I talked to is that the
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.880]   demand, the people who actually are looking for new space, they
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.400]   only want to be in the best areas. And they want to be in
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.240]   the newest buildings that have the best amenities. And so that
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.000]   sort of commodity office tower where there's barely anybody
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.360]   ever there, like no one wants that. So I think people would
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.520]   rather pay a higher rent. I mean, the rent will still be
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.600]   much lower, probably half the price of what it used to be, but
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.800]   they'd rather pay a little bit more for that than get like a
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.000]   zombie office tower. We can't talk about all this without
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.320]   talking about two cases. Tragically, a shoplifter, a
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.880]   criminal who was stealing from a drugstore in San Francisco, I
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.200]   got shot. And the video was released, I'm sure you've seen
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.280]   it sacks. And then here in New York, everybody's talking about
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.360]   this one instance of a marine trying to subdue a violent
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.040]   homeless person with two other people. And it's on everybody's
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.720]   minds here. And Brooke Jenkins is not prosecuting in San
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.640]   Francisco, the shooter, they look like, you know, a clean
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.360]   shoot, as they would say in the police business, and
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.720]   appropriate. And it's tragic to say it is, but the person did
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.200]   charge the security guard, the security guard did fear for
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.040]   their life and shot him. So Brooke Jenkins is not going to
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   pursue anything. But in New York City, they're pursuing
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.720]   manslaughter for the person who did seem a bit excessive from
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.600]   the video, it's hard to tell what the reality is in these
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.880]   situations. Any thoughts on it, David, these two cases in two
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.600]   cities, tell us.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.160]   Yeah, look, I mean, the only time you can get a source da
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.080]   excited about prosecuting someone is when they act in
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.440]   self defense or defensive others. I mean, this marine, I
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.200]   guess Daniel penny is his name, he was acting in defense of
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.120]   others, the person who he stopped was someone with an
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.960]   extensive criminal record, who had just recently engaged in a
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.080]   attempt at kidnapping who had punched elderly people had
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.680]   dozens of arrests. In fact, people on Reddit were talking
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.760]   about how dangerous this person was, apparently, a dozen years
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:11.720]   ago or so he was seen as more of like a quirky like Michael
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.560]   Jackson impersonator, street performer, street performer, but
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.360]   something happened. This is according to a Reddit post that
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.040]   I saw where something happened. And there was some sort of
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:24.200]   psychological break. And then since then, he's had dozens and
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.320]   dozens of crimes. And they just keep letting him loose through
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.640]   this revolving door of a justice system we have. And now look, no
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   one likes to see him basically dying. And yeah, it's too bad.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.640]   It's horrible that that happened. Tragic. I don't know,
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.640]   though, that if you're trying to stop someone, I don't know how
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.640]   easy it is to precisely control whether you use too much force
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.960]   or not. So I think Daniel Penny has a strong case that he was
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.560]   acting in self defense and defensive others. And there
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.320]   were two other people, by the way, who are holding this
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.680]   person down. There are three of them restraining him. And what
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.080]   universally New Yorker said to me of all different backgrounds
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.880]   was this is not a race issue. The other I think one or two of
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.560]   the other people were people of color. It was not a race issue.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.640]   And they're trying to make it into a race issue in both these
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.960]   cases. And it's this is literally what happens. It just
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.880]   having been through this in New York in the 70s and 80s when you
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.240]   do not say who's they when you say trying to make a bunch of
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.240]   protests on the street, both in San Francisco, and New York
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.720]   people protesting these as you know, justice issues. The fact
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.680]   is, if you do not, if you allow lawlessness for too long a
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:38.080]   period of time, you get a Bernie gets situation. And Bernie gets
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.840]   people can look it up in the 80s. I was a kid when it
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.680]   happened. But they tried to mug somebody, he had a gun, he shot
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.400]   him. And like, this is what happens if you allow lawlessness
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.860]   for extended periods of time. It's just, you're basically
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.080]   gambling. And what happened to Bernie gets he got not guilty,
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.480]   the case, he got not guilty, but I think he had an illegal gun.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.680]   So he was guilty of that. The Bernie gets thing was really
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.480]   crazy. Because at the time, the climate in New York, and this
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:12.560]   1984 shooting. There was a portion of people who I don't
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.080]   want to say they made him a hero, but they made it a see,
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.840]   this is what happens if you allow us to be assaulted
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.520]   forever, we're going to fight back at some point. That was the
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.080]   vibe in New York when I was a child. I was 1415 years old when
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.640]   this happened. He was charged with attempted murder assault.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.400]   Jason, what was the name of that vigilante group that used to
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.640]   walk the streets to something angels that was the guardian
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.880]   angels guardian angels. So it was so bad in the 80s. And I
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.560]   actually almost signed up for the guardian angels. I went to
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.360]   their headquarters because I was practicing martial arts. And I
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.800]   thought I would check it out. And they had their office in
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.880]   Hell's Kitchen, I didn't wind up joining. But what they would do
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.920]   is they would just ride the subway, they would wear a
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.560]   certain type of hat, and wear a guardian angel shirt. And all
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:56.600]   they did was ride the subways, a red beret, and they would just
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.080]   ride the subways. And you felt like martial arts were you
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.680]   taking? Taekwondo? I was in Taekwondo. Yeah, this is before
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.680]   mixed martial arts, but they just rode the subways. And
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.800]   honestly, I've been on the subways with the many times you
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.640]   felt safe. And it wasn't vigilantes. They were guardian
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.160]   angels, they use that term. And many times they would do exactly
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.440]   what this Marine did, which is try to subdue somebody who was
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:23.120]   committing crime. I was, I had two distinct instances where
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.800]   people tried to mug me, you know, riding the subways in New
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.520]   York in the 80s. Two distinct times. And one was a group of
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.360]   people and one was one person like it was pretty scary. Both
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.320]   times I navigated it, but it was Yeah, not pleasant in the 80s in
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.040]   New York. I say one more thing about this. Danny's honey,
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.240]   Jordan Neely case. So look, at the end of the day, this is
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.080]   gonna be litigated. I don't know all the details, they're gonna
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.160]   have to litigate whether Daniel pennies use of force was was
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.760]   excessive or not. But But here's the thing is that the media has
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:56.800]   been falsely representing Jordan Neely by only posting 10 year
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.320]   old photos of him and leaving out crucial information. This
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:02.560]   was a press report. So again, this is why I mentioned the
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.640]   whole Michael Jackson impersonator thing is that the
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.760]   media keeps for training Neely as this innocent, harmless guy
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.840]   who is this like delightful Michael Jackson personator. In
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.520]   truth, he hasn't done that in more than a decade, because
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.840]   again, he had some sort of mental break. And since then,
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.680]   he's been arrested over 40 times, including for attempting
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:26.120]   to kidnap a seven year old child. And so the media is not
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.280]   portraying this case, I think in an accurate way. And I think as
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.280]   a result of that, it leads to pressure on the DA to prosecute
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.280]   someone who has I think, a strong self defense claim. Or
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   you know, maybe the DA just wants to do this anyway. And it
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.420]   gives the DA cover to do this Soros is I mean, I know that we
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.880]   had this back and forth with us. Why is CNN being inaccurate? Do
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:51.800]   you think sex? They're basically cooperating with Alvin Bragg's
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.520]   interpretation of the case. They're trying to make the case
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.120]   against penny look as damning as possible.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.200]   Why don't they just take it straight down the middle? It's a
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.360]   tragedy. We have a screwed up situation here. We got a mental
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.880]   health crisis. And it's a tragedy for everybody involved
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.200]   on the Bernie get stuff. He served eight of a 12 month
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.800]   sentence for the firearm charge. And he had a massive $43
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:17.560]   million civil judgment against him. In 1996. Decade later, it's
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:17.880]   just
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:21.360]   this is a little different than the gets thing because pulling
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.040]   out a gun and shooting somebody. Yeah, that's deadly intent.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.840]   Yeah, that's that's a huge escalation. Whereas penny, he's
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.520]   a he's a trained Marine, right? He's trying to immobilize him.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:34.480]   He has to believe that he's just trying to subdue. Yes, nearly.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.920]   And so still using a chokehold to kill him. That's an
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.360]   unfortunate consequence of what happened. But he was trying to
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.160]   restrain the guy. As far as we know, right, as far as we know.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.480]   Yeah, I mean, tragedies all around. We got to have law and
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.400]   order. I tweeted like, I don't know why we still have the post
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.680]   office, maybe we can make that like once a week, and redo all
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.640]   of that space and allow every American who's suffering from
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.280]   mental illness to check in to what used to be the post
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:04.120]   office. You know, maybe like once a week, and obviously give
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.240]   those people very gentle landings, but I don't think we
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.800]   need postal service more than once or twice a week. And then
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.320]   let you let's reallocate some money towards mental health in
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.280]   this country where anybody who's sick, who feels like they're
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.540]   violent or feels like they're suicidal can just go into a
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.440]   publicly provided facility and say, I'm a sick person, please
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.680]   help me this would solve a lot of problems in society. We've
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.160]   got a mental health crisis, we should provide mental health
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:31.760]   services to all Americans. And it's obviously easy thing for us
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.480]   to afford to do.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.880]   And if we had done that, then this never would have happened.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:38.240]   Exactly. I mean, literally, you have sacks who wants to balance
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.920]   the budget saying, Hey, this is something worth spending on. We
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.800]   can all agree on this
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.160]   compared to the impact on society. I don't think it'd be
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:44.960]   a huge expense.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:48.120]   We would save money. We'd save money because a city like San
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.640]   Francisco could become quite livable or New York if and then
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.880]   you've got forbid these terrible school shootings, you know, if
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:57.240]   you avoid even one of them, it's 30 people's lives or 10 people's
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.440]   lives. So it's
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:02.400]   convert post offices, what we need to do is stand up scale
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.040]   shelters, and it doesn't need to be done on the most expensive
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:09.720]   land in a given city outside of cities. Why does this? There is
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.360]   no expectation in Europe for like Paris or London to be
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.920]   affordable or Hong Kong to be affordable. There are affordable
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.760]   places 30 minutes outside of those places where you could
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.320]   put these facilities. I just want to ask one question to
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.720]   sacks because I don't know. And I know sacks is a little bit
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.680]   deeper into this. And what is George sources motivation for
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.120]   putting in these lawless insane da is like, I understand that
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.080]   he was able to buy them. They're low cost. There's not a lot of
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.480]   money in them. Okay, I understand that that's
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.880]   tablestakes. But what is his actual motivation for causing
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.760]   chaos in cities?
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.000]   Listen, we can't know exactly what his motivation is. But what
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.680]   he did is he went into cities where he doesn't live and
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.440]   flooded the zone with money to get his preferred candidate
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.360]   elect his da. Now, the reason he did that was to change the law.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.640]   And the way that he changed law was not through legislature
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.560]   is the way you're supposed to operate, but rather, by abusing
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.880]   prosecutorial discretion. So in other words, once he gets his
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.320]   Soros da elected, they can change the law by deciding what
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.880]   to prosecute and what not to prosecute. Right. And that's why
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.720]   there is so much lawlessness in these cities.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.400]   But there's a better path you're saying?
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:19.480]   Yeah, but this is not the only way that Soros has, I'd say,
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:24.320]   imposed his values on cities that he doesn't even live in.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.640]   Where does he live? I think he's a New York guy, but I'm not
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:31.120]   sure. But but he's gone far beyond that, obviously, in these
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.400]   elections, but also, he's done this across the world. Soros has
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.680]   this thing called the Open Society Foundation, which sounds
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.640]   like it's spreading democracy and liberal values, but in fact,
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.160]   is fomenting regime change all over the world. And he's been
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.800]   sponsoring and funding color revolutions all over the world.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.880]   Now, if you like some of the values he's spreading, then
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.040]   maybe you think that's a good thing. But I can tell you that
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.480]   the way this is perceived by all these countries all over the
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.520]   world is it creates tremendous dissension and conflict. And
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.680]   then they look at America and they basically say, you know,
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:07.800]   this American billionaire is coming into our country, and
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:12.400]   he's funding regime change. And it makes America look bad. Now
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.000]   he's doing this, I think, with the cooperation of our State
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.640]   Department, a lot of cases, and maybe the CIA, I don't know. But
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.540]   this is why America, frankly, is hated all over the world as we
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:26.320]   go running around meddling in the internal affairs of all
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.080]   these countries.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.400]   Two is this guy? Well, they're like, that was the other thing I
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.520]   heard is that he's not all there. And the people around him
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.440]   are doing these kind of things in his organization.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.760]   I heard something similar is that as the idiot son,
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.480]   Alexander, who's really now pulling the strings. Would you
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.560]   would you allow Soros to speak at all and summit? Would you
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.260]   enter? Sure. Yeah, let's have Soros or a son and Nick and
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:45.640]   explain themselves if they're so proud.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   Well, apparently, there was an article that Alexander Soros has
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:51.240]   visited the White House like two dozen times during the Biden
