[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   About 10,000 years ago, the ancestors of people in Tasmania, which is this large island south
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.120]   of Australia, they had fire, they lost it. And so what seems to be happening is that hundreds,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   thousands, tens of thousands of little groups are communicating hardly at all with each other,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.320]   are in very small sizes. In every group of human beings of hundreds of people,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.400]   they accumulate shared cultural knowledge, knowledge about tools, knowledge about life
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.920]   strategies, and they build up a shared knowledge more and more and more and more. But if you have
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.440]   a limited sized group of people that's not interacting with other large group of people,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.240]   occasionally this group has an information loss, there's a natural disaster, key elders in the
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.200]   group die, and knowledge gets lost, and there's not a critical mass of shared knowledge. But once
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.440]   it goes above some kind of critical mass, the group can get larger, the amount of shared knowledge
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   becomes greater, and then you have a runaway process. The adaptations that humans have are
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.720]   ones that allow us to access a rich amount of shared knowledge and not just to rely on figuring
