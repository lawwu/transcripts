[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   Well, to get to today's topic, I'll tell you what inspired it.
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.480]   Let me give you a little bit of a peek behind the curtain.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.200]   As I was leaving New Hampshire, I spent my summer up at Dartmouth College as a Montgomery
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200]   fellow.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.880]   As I left New Hampshire, one of the things I was thinking in particular I'm going to
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:24.400]   miss is the locations I would leverage on the campus of Dartmouth College to get some
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.120]   thinking done.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.560]   So I worked on some New Yorker pieces.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.280]   I worked on some academic pieces.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.360]   I finalized the manuscript for Slow Productivity, my next book.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.440]   All that happened this summer while I was up there.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.360]   Dartmouth is a very scenic campus.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.040]   If you make your way to the upper valley of New Hampshire, you have to check it out.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.520]   One of the most beautiful campuses in the country.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.580]   It's one of the reasons I went there is I just thought visually it would be conducive
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.920]   to deeper thinking.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.120]   But they've got great locations.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.900]   I was using this summer the Orozco murals in the basement of Baker Library quite a bit.
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.840]   This is a long basement room in which there are these famous murals painted by Orozco in
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   the 1930s.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:17.120]   This may have been a WPA funded project about the history of the Americas from the perspective
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.560]   of a non-white European.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.080]   But they're famous murals.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.360]   We actually found in my grandfather, John Newport's diaries after he died, he talked
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.800]   about coming to visit Dartmouth in the 1930s as part of a debate trip.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.720]   I guess they were doing debate up there.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.920]   He writes about in his diary, coming there to see these brand new Orozco murals.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.480]   That's a great place to work.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480]   The Tower Room in Baker Library is another great place to work.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.520]   This is an old school wood paneled library, double story library with good dark wood details.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.000]   You can sit in a plush armchair looking out a window over the green.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.320]   I also made use of the cross country trails down beyond Ockham Pond, surrounding Pine
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.640]   Park that was right down the street from where we lived.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.400]   Good thinking walks through the woods there.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.000]   So a lot of great locations.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.720]   A lot of great locations.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   So that got me thinking about locations and its connection to having creative or really
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.520]   high value thoughts.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.280]   So that was on my mind.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.440]   Then one of you sent me an article on this same topic.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.880]   So now I was thinking about, okay, all of these cool places I worked at Dartmouth.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.720]   Then one of you sent me a really cool article on this topic, which I'm going to load up
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.520]   on the screen now.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.640]   So you can watch this.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.560]   If you're watching, and I'll read what's on the screen.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.820]   If you're watching, you can go to the deeplife.com or youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.200]   This is episode 262.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.540]   We don't put the number on the title anymore, but the episode titles are in the descriptions.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.320]   It's also just the episode that came out on August 21st, if you're looking for it.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   Okay.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   So here's this article I have on the screen.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.280]   This is from Lance Fortnow, the complexity theorist, computer scientist, Lance Fortnow's
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.760]   blog, Computational Complexity.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   I have it on the screen.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.000]   This is a guest post.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.920]   So Lance didn't write it, but by a guest post by Evangelos Georgiotis.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.600]   All right.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.840]   So here's what we want to see here.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.880]   This article is talking about where good academic papers come from.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.240]   So in order, I'm reading now, in order to generate a paper, one needs to come up with
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.480]   a result, something novel, fresh, or interesting to say.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.520]   The question that has baffled this author is what represents a conducive or perhaps
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.280]   even optimal setting for generating papers.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.160]   These papers come in different flavors, dot, dot, dot.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.260]   The settings may vary, but ultimately what would be interesting to investigate is whether
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.360]   there is a common denominator in terms of setting or environment, a necessary but not
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.120]   sufficient condition so to speak.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   All right.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.880]   So this is the setup for this article is the author here is saying, where do people come
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.120]   up with really good academic paper ideas?
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.960]   What is the right environment or process for doing this?
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.120]   All right, so let's return to the article and see what the author concludes.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.240]   Here are some accounts of others which may be helpful as reference point.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   Knuth's papers entitled semantics of context-free grammar along with the analysis of algorithm
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.560]   represent two instances that suggest research institutes might not provide an optimal idea
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   environment for idea generation.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.980]   As Knuth points out in selected papers on computer languages, perhaps new ideas emerge
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.980]   most often from hectic disorganized activity when a great many sources of stimulation are
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.380]   present at once, when numerous deadlines need to be met, and when other miscellaneous activities
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.080]   like child rearing are also mixed into the agenda.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.120]   Knuth goes on to say that it was challenging to do creative work in office and that finding
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.920]   a few hideaways provided some form of solution, aka sitting under that oak tree near Lake
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.680]   Lagunita.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.640]   That said, the inspirational settings for getting to the zone for the aforementioned
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.600]   two papers were provided by California beaches.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.920]   All right, so there Donald Knuth, famed Stanford professor emeritus now and author of the art
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.520]   of computer programming talks about having a pristine research location.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.320]   Okay, we're at this research institute.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.520]   We're all just here in our offices working on research.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.360]   Actually isn't that conducive in his opinion to really good ideas.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.320]   He says more hecticness is important, that you have deadlines, you're rushing between
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.240]   different activities you're going to, even child rearing.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.320]   We've talked about this in recent episodes, that we shouldn't think about child rearing
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.760]   only as a source of negative or drag on the ability to have a sustainable professional
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.760]   career.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.200]   So you see all these different distractions in his experience somehow unlock or occasionally
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.720]   unlock more insight than just being in the pure pristine.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.960]   I'm in my office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.640]   I'm just sitting here trying to come up with big ideas.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.080]   He also mentioned sometimes just novel environments, a particular tree he liked to sit under, and
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.280]   in particular, California beaches.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.440]   The two papers cited earlier from Knuth were both had core ideas that came up at beaches.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.400]   All right, let's return to the article here.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.760]   All right, so then he says, hold that observation.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.640]   Is this not something we've come across somewhere else?
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.240]   Fields medalist Stephen Small in Chaos, Finding a Horseshoe on the Beaches of Rio, suggests
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.040]   that some of his best work happened at his beach office.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.720]   Whether beaches do provide a good setting remains to be shown, perhaps for very innovative
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   ideas.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.320]   Oceanic freedom is necessary.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.460]   There's a couple other quotes from here.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.520]   Some other meaningful probabilistic advice comes from the Fat Tales Department.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.880]   In The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb, he says, go to parties.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.440]   If you're a scientist, you will chance upon a remark that might spark a new research.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.760]   Meanwhile, Murray Gelman provides an interesting collective account in his Google Tech Talk
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.400]   entitled On Getting Creative Ideas.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.880]   Gelman recollects a workshop he attended in 1969 in Aspen that focused on the experience
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.280]   of getting creative ideas, not just among mathematicians and theoretical physicists,
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.520]   but also poets and artists.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.560]   This account seems to neglect the actual setting that might nurture creative thought process,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.400]   but provides interesting references to people, such as Herman Von Helmots, who happen to
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.920]   have thought about this topic and partitioned the process in terms of saturation, incubation,
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.200]   and illumination.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.800]   So we got here, you know, some more ideas.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.400]   Nassim Taleb is saying, go to parties, be around other people.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.120]   Murray Gelman, the physicist, talks about a workshop on creativity where Herman Von
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.520]   Helmots talked about this formula that he had.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:03.560]   Let me say it again, saturation, incubation, and illumination as a way of actually building
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.040]   up insight.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:14.520]   There's a book, Jacques Hadamard has a book called The Mathematician's Mind that both
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.880]   goes through and iterates on this Helmots three-stage process for coming up with big
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   ideas.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.760]   And finally, here's the last thing from this paper, I'll just read this here.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.840]   What are good venues or workshops for generating paper?
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.280]   Or let's rephrase that a bit.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.800]   What type of atmosphere at venues fosters creativity?
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   What food for thought to provide participants and how to distribute that food for thought
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.740]   over a given day?
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.440]   One person, the author talked to proposed easy problems, informal atmosphere focusing
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.520]   exclusively on thinking about problems in a cycle of downtime where one meets in two
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.320]   intense sessions and have free time otherwise.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.360]   All right, so just a bunch of thoughts there.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.200]   That's a theoretical computer scientist thinking about where good ideas come from.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.880]   This of course is a topic I've written about as well.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:02.720]   I'm going to load up one of my own old articles here from my blog from calnewport.com.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.280]   All right, here's an article from April 2016.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.480]   This was actually probably right after Deep Work came out.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.320]   The title of this article I have up on the screen is on using inspiring locations to
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.080]   inspire deep work.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.040]   The article has a picture of the Capitol building.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.960]   Then it starts by saying, "The return of spring marks the return of one of my favorite
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.180]   deep work strategies, the concentration circuit."
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:37.760]   So the idea here is you go through a series of very deep work inducing locations.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.960]   You circuit from one to the other.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.560]   So I took pictures.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.160]   I took pictures of a concentration circuit that I had done recently.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:51.400]   According to this article, I was in downtown DC to record a radio show appearance and here
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.760]   is my concentration circuit.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.340]   All right, location number one is a bench that was tucked into a quiet corner not far
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.340]   from the Capitol building.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:07.560]   I believe that bench is on the grounds of the National Botanical Gardens outside the
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.320]   Botanical Gardens.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.280]   All right, and then here is me inside.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   I spent some time.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.440]   There's a picture of a bench inside the jungle biome of the National Botanical Gardens inside
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.880]   a giant greenhouse.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.040]   That's another place I worked.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.260]   Then there's a picture here of the, what is this called?
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.700]   This is in the basement of the National Gallery, the tunnel underground that connects the East
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.280]   and West Wings, the modern and the non-modern wings.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:41.200]   You go through this cool light display tunnel to a cafe in which no Wi-Fi and there's no
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   cell service.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.120]   You can see a waterfall falling.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.920]   And then finally I had a pair of armchairs I found.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:53.120]   This is on the second floor of the Native American History Museum, also off the mall.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.840]   So those were, it was an article where I was talking about a concentration circuit of different
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.320]   novel locations in downtown DC, where on a recent day when I wrote that article, I had
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.560]   gone to work.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.920]   All right, so what's going on here?
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:18.200]   I would say this use of location to help get big ideas, which we know is a well-known idea.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.440]   We just heard from all of those famous mathematicians talk about it.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.520]   We read one of my articles about it.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:31.160]   That is a well-known strategy in a broader philosophy that I call creativity hacking.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.120]   The idea between creativity hacking is actually being systematic or intentional about how
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.400]   you extract the most creative or impactful ideas from your brain.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.440]   So location is a big role in this.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:50.040]   Now how does location interact with the generation of deeper, more impactful ideas?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.480]   Well here I think where people get confused is there's no one explanation.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.720]   There was a lot of different examples there, the party, the beach, being at a workshop
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.520]   or at the third floor of a museum in DC.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.700]   There's no one explanation, no one mechanism that explains why all of these different example
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.440]   locations of locations being used to generate creativity, there's no one mechanism that
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   explains it.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.800]   Because there's actually, the best I could summarize, at least three different mechanisms
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.320]   at work that explain the various ways that locations can interact with your thinking.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.480]   Different locations will draw from different mechanisms, but not typically all three.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.240]   So I want to go through these three mechanisms real quick and then we'll step back and say,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.920]   okay, so what is my advice for leveraging these mechanisms to do creativity hacking
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.120]   in your own life?
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.400]   So the first mechanism at play is the whiteboard effect.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.280]   And this is centered on being around other interesting people.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.200]   So environments that put you around other interesting people have these two sub-components
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.080]   that lead up to the whiteboard effect.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.800]   Number one, they have information or ideas you don't.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.520]   So it's like you're expanding the reservoir of potential ideas.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.400]   So I call this the whiteboard effect because it's the proverbial scene of you're at the
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.160]   whiteboard with other people working on the same problem.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.460]   They're going to know a technique you don't.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.440]   You're going to have an idea that you didn't have.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.000]   You're extending the amount of neuronal real estate that is dedicated to whatever thinking
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.300]   is happening that gives you more grist for that particular metaphorical mill.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.760]   The other sub-component here is that when you're working with other people, so you're
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.640]   talking with them directly about an idea, or you're at the whiteboard taking turns trying
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   to solve a proof, you focus harder.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.800]   So again, you're going to get more out of your brain.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.420]   Now I go into that particular sub-component in more detail in my book, Deep Work.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.660]   But the idea is if I'm staring at a whiteboard and you're staring at the same whiteboard,
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.560]   we're trying to solve a problem.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.000]   I'm more likely to sustain my concentration because if I let my mind wander, there's going
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.120]   to be a social capital cost.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.580]   I'm going to have to stop you and say, hold on, hold on, go back, go back.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.580]   I wasn't paying attention to what you said.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.780]   Also I want to make progress.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.780]   It's impressive.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.860]   I want to impress you or be a team player.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.980]   So you also get more focus out of your own brain when you're working with other people.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.020]   All right, so that's the first factor whiteboard effect.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.020]   More ideas, more focus if you're working with other people.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:25.380]   We see this when Lance Fortnow, that art on his blog, they're talking about the right
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.540]   workshops or the scene to lab talking about parties.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.120]   That's all about the whiteboard effect.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.700]   Another great example from my own life.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:41.940]   There is a seminar series held in rural Germany called the Dagstuhl seminars, Dagstuhl, D-A-G-S-T-H-U-L.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.820]   And it's dedicated mainly towards theoretical computer science.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.380]   And what they do is they will, someone will apply, I want to organize a workshop, a Dagstuhl
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.380]   workshop.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.100]   And you invite, it's one problem, you'll come up with one problem and you invite researchers
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.300]   around the world who know about that problem.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:02.660]   And you all come to this research center, which is built on a castle, a castle in rural
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.660]   Germany.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.060]   And I remember going to one of these earlier in my career and a bunch of us came from all
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.820]   over the world.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.280]   And what you do is you have informal talks where people talk about problems they're working
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.100]   on or techniques that are really interesting.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:21.620]   And then a lot of time beyond that to just discuss problems with the people who are there.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.900]   There's unlimited coffee, the meals, they assign the seats and rotate so that you have
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.100]   to encounter different people and different ideas.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.980]   There's also all the German beer you can drink in the evenings, this honor system to keep
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.260]   track so you can pay later for what you drunk and really cool grounds.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.260]   There's nowhere to go.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.740]   It's impossible to get here.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.300]   There's nowhere to go to, no town, you're sort of stuck at this castle.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.060]   So I went there earlier in my career, a bunch of my colleagues were there.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.700]   I did the math at some point, six papers.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:54.620]   And the years that followed, six papers came out of the conversations that were held at
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.620]   Dagstuhl.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.020]   All right, so that's the first mechanism.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:04.500]   The second mechanism that can come into play when creativity hacking using location is
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.100]   novel stimulation.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.820]   So being in environments that have new or novel stimulation in terms of sights, smells
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.780]   and sounds can fire up new circuits of your brain.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.220]   Your brain is open to this new experience.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.100]   It's interested, it's taking in more input.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.740]   And I don't know exactly how this neuroscience works, but it seems to be when you're in that
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:30.260]   state, you're also open to new abstract ideas.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.220]   So if you're going to the same office at the same building where you go every day, your
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.140]   brain is not as open or interested in what's going on.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.440]   It's more focused probably on internal issues or what's happening in your inbox.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.380]   But when you're in the novel situation, your brain shifts mode and then you can hijack
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:52.080]   that shift to have originality in your thinking that might be otherwise hard to generate.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.880]   So I think those examples from Lance Fortnow's blog about the beach, Knuth and others using
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.260]   the beach is an example of this.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.760]   The beach is a novel environment.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:08.600]   You have this big, vast vista and the sounds, and it's very different than life in a building.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   It's very different to life in a town.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.480]   So beaches are famously leveraging this mechanism.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:19.080]   I've had multiple, multiple papers come out of beach walks back when we used to do more
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.160]   beach vacations.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.400]   Real minimalism, that book, that whole philosophy came out of a beach walk as well.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.760]   I think my examples of the museums in DC, my concentration circuit that I showed you
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.840]   recently, that's another example of using novel stimulation.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:40.760]   I'm in a jungle, in a giant greenhouse, in the National Botanical Gardens.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.120]   I'm going to have some original thoughts there that I'm not going to have on the third floor
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.880]   of St. Mary's Hall at Georgetown University.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.520]   All right, the third mechanism that can come into play when creativity hacking with location,
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.600]   avoidance of the familiar.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.520]   All right, so that novel stimulation can open up your mind.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.880]   Very familiar stimuli can close it.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:12.760]   So if your brain sees something in a familiar location that brings with it a lot of cognitive
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.240]   weight, you can hijack your brain to start thinking about what's related to that object.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.440]   And now you are worse off when it comes to having original thinking.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.880]   So the classic example here, I think I talked about this in my New Yorker piece on working
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:33.440]   from near home, is if you're at your home office and you see the full laundry basket,
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.800]   because you're at home, there's a part of your brain that starts thinking, "We got to
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   do laundry.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   When should I do it?
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.920]   Do I have enough clothes for tomorrow?"
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.640]   You've just hijacked part of your brain.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.560]   It's going to get in the way of original thinking.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.800]   Same thing happens at a traditional office.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.360]   Let's say you say hi to a colleague in the hallway as you walk back from the coffee machine.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.260]   Well, that colleague might remind your brain, "Oh my God, I got to get back to her because
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.880]   we're trying to organize this thing and I owe her this information.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.520]   Well, what should I say in my email?
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.640]   Oh, let me start writing the email in my head."
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.000]   There's nothing our brains like to do more for whatever reason than to write emails in
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   our head.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.980]   You've just hijacked a big portion of your brain.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.560]   When you're at your desk where you also work on logistics, where you also do email, where
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.840]   you also do Zoom, that same desk, your brain is thinking about those or have those things
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.080]   in its background that's in that type of mindset.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.560]   It's hijacking neuronal hardware there.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.520]   You're getting less original thinking.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.060]   This is why, for example, people, at least in the day before you could turn on Wi-Fi
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:38.800]   on air travel, used to get a lot of cool thoughts done on planes because there was nothing familiar.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.680]   So even though it was not a novel stimulated environment like the beach, like, "Oh my
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.840]   God, look at this great vista," you still were avoiding the familiar and people would
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.000]   find out they could focus more.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.960]   There wasn't anything pulling at my attention.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.800]   So we have three different mechanisms that can explain location's role in creativity
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.320]   hacking, the whiteboard effect, novel stimulation, and avoidance of the familiar.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.500]   And as we saw, different environments leverage different combinations of these mechanisms.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.420]   No one mechanism explains all of the different environments that seem to be useful for deep
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.420]   thinking.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.060]   All right, so now let's put this into use.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.780]   Let's say you were in a position where having original ideas would be professionally valuable.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.980]   Maybe it's core to your main job, coming up with a new strategy or algorithm if you're
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.500]   a computer programmer.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.300]   Maybe you're working on the side on a book and having a brilliant idea for a book could
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.960]   make a really big difference.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.540]   Whatever the situation is, how do we leverage these mechanisms?
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.300]   If you really want to up the quality of the original thoughts you have?
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.820]   Well, I'm going to give you three suggestions, each taking place at a different timescale.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:50.420]   So if you want to leverage this creativity hacking every day, you should have a separate
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.420]   space set aside in which you do deeper, more creative thinking.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.020]   All right, so this is an everyday habit.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.220]   I just have a place I can always go if it comes time to think.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.740]   And this place should be distinctive.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.340]   Now, it could be an actual physical location at your office or home office.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.380]   If you work in an office, this could be I go to a conference room.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:15.540]   I reserve a small conference room to go to with just my notebook when I want to do creative
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.540]   thinking.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:21.180]   If it's at your house, you could have something distinct from your normal home office where
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.900]   you go when you want to do the deeper thinking, the sort of attic space that you've transformed,
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.300]   the garden shed that you've made into a thinking shed.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:37.460]   That last example, by the way, is drawn from the late great nonfiction writer David McCullough,
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.440]   whose house in West Tisbury, Martha's Vineyard, had a very nice home office with fax machines
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.140]   and phones and all of his files, and then had a garden shed with a typewriter and a
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.140]   desk.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.820]   So when it came time to write, he went to the garden shed.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:57.660]   When it came time to organize a publicity tour, answer mail, or send out requests for
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.960]   accessing archives, he had a different home office.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.520]   The more distinctive you can make your dedicated deep workspace, the more effective it is going
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.660]   to be.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.540]   It does not have to be a space you own.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.280]   It could also be a path.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.940]   This is like Darwin with his path at downhouse.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.160]   It could be, okay, I leave my office and walk this loop on the grounds at the office park.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.260]   It could be I leave my house and I do this one mile loop with a coffee shop halfway through.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.260]   So it could be someplace that you don't own.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.820]   It could be a particular path you follow.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.900]   And it's something you can do every day just to make sure that your deepest thinking is
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.180]   done in a different location than your other type of thinking.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.440]   All right, moving up in time scales, every week, schedule time on your calendar to go
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.420]   somewhere novel and interesting to work.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.860]   It could be going to a coffee shop.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:52.860]   It could be driving to a trailhead, hiking a half mile into the woods and working by
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.260]   particularly scenic spot near a stream.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.620]   That's something I used to do quite frequently.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:03.300]   It could be going to a museum in town or a particular public library or university library
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.540]   if you're near a college town.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.860]   But get a good session in once a week where you put in some effort to get there.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.980]   You're not there very often, but when you do get there, you are there to really think
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.980]   originally and creatively.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:22.460]   Final time scale, every season, every season try to gather other people you work with to
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.540]   unlock bigger ideas.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.420]   So gather people in an interesting space.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.820]   Let's do a mini Dagstuhl.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.580]   Let's do a mini workshop.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.140]   Let's think through big ideas.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.620]   If you're a writer, it's different writers to bounce writing ideas off of them.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:40.700]   If you're in business, you bring your team to think through strategies together.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.380]   Your computer scientist working on an algorithm, your computer developer, get together some
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.280]   of the programmers and talk shop.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.660]   Go somewhere that's not your office.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.940]   Go somewhere novel.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.420]   If it's possible, go for a hike.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.740]   I like that one a lot.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.820]   Two, three people hiking, talking generates ideas at a rate that is five times what you're
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.660]   going to get on a Zoom meeting if we're going to make a comparison.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.900]   Or you go to the beach.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.460]   If you live near the beach, someplace interesting, a restaurant, a pub, I don't know what it
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.480]   is, but at least once a season, get together the best minds that you know, working on what
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.980]   you know and get that whiteboard effect going.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.420]   You do those three things, have a distinctive deep workspace every day, have a distinctive
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:23.620]   location you go every week and have a gathering of other great minds to brainstorm once a
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.620]   season.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:32.100]   Those three things, which are not a major ask in terms of your schedule, will significantly
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.220]   increase the depth and originality of the creative thoughts you have.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.020]   This is the core of creativity hacking.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.880]   It's not just that there's creative people and non-creative people.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.700]   How you go about this weird alchemy, which is extracting original novel thoughts from
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.620]   a mess of neurons that weren't evolved for abstract symbolic thinking, how you go about
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.620]   that matters.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.700]   So it's good news, bad news.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.580]   The bad news is you can't just hope to white knuckle yourself the big ideas in between
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.720]   email checks and Zoom meetings at your home office desk.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.460]   The good news is most people are not creativity hacking.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.840]   So if you do, you are going to get an advantage.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:14.860]   You are going to have a much more steady stream of great ideas.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.020]   So the second segment of the show, we're going to do questions from you.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.860]   And I'm going to try to make these questions all roughly orbiting this topic of coming
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.020]   up with ideas, stimulation, creativity, brainstorming.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.600]   So we'll get into the weeds here.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   Before we get to that, though, I do want to mention one of the sponsors that makes this
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   show possible.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:40.620]   In particular, this show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.460]   So we talked about creativity hacking.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:50.900]   Well, let's generalize this briefly here for the purposes of this ad to cognitive hacking.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:56.740]   If you are suffering mentally, if you find yourself having ruminative, repeated negative
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.560]   thoughts, if you find anxiety, like so many people are experiencing these days, is so
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.460]   strong that it's getting in the way of how you approach your life.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.860]   If there's strong emotions that are really getting in the way, they feel as if this is
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.580]   not helpful to me and what I'm doing with my life.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:17.580]   There's something you can do about that, and that is therapy.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.660]   With therapy, you have trained experts who know how to deal with the life of the mind.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.400]   And if the life of the mind has gone in a non-helpful direction, they can help get it
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   back.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:33.580]   They can help you get your mind back under control, make it someone, a companion and
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.700]   not an enemy.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.620]   So in a world of knowledge work where your mind matters, it's at the core of everything
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.260]   you do, you should really care about your mental health.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:51.100]   So you're thinking about starting therapy, I suggest giving BetterHelp a try.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.100]   Here's why.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.260]   It's entirely online.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.900]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.540]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist, and
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.520]   you can switch therapist at any time for no additional charge.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.180]   So what BetterHelp is doing here is getting rid of that complicated, ambiguous barrier
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.620]   of entry to therapy that used to be there.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.700]   This sort of asking friends for referrals and just calling places that happen to be
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.740]   nearby and you find out that of course they're full and their waiting list is seven years
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.700]   long and why would you even bother calling them in the first place?
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.200]   There's also the expense factor.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.300]   You're not sure about therapy or what style you want to try, and it's very expensive locally.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.340]   BetterHelp solves all that.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:36.480]   You do it online so you can be matched with someone anywhere in the country.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   It's more affordable.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   You can switch.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   You can try out.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   You can see what works.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:47.040]   So it's a fantastic on-ramp to the critical goal of taking care of your mental health.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.480]   So let therapy be your map with BetterHelp.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:28:03.660]   Visit BetterHelp.com/deepquestions.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.800]   Don't forget the slash deep questions as it will get you 10% off your first month.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   That's BetterHelp.com/deepquestions.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:17.440]   I also want to talk about our good friends at Hinson Shaving.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.320]   The razor that I use.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   So here's the deal.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.780]   The Hinson razor is this beautifully precision milled aluminum tool.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.040]   And Hinson's knows how to do precision milling because their main business is actually doing
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.480]   aerospace parts manufacturing.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.700]   We're talking about things that go into the International Space Station, components that
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.420]   go onto the Mars Rover.
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.880]   So they have these aerospace grade CNC milling machines that can do incredibly precise metal
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.880]   milling.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.280]   And they use these to build this beautiful razor.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.600]   And why does precision matter?
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   Well, it means you can take a 10 cent safety razor blade, put it into this beautiful aluminum
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:06.680]   precision milled razor, screw it in, and only a, and I'm looking at the number here, .001
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:15.240]   inch of the blade goes past, well, 0013, let's be precise, of the blade goes past the edge
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   of the razor.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:21.560]   And when you have just the very edge of the blade sticking past the razor, what you avoid
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.880]   is the diving board effect, the up and down bending of the blade if too much sticks out.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.320]   That's what caused nicks.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   That's what leads to clogs with just the barest edge sticking out.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   It's very stiff.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.440]   And what that gives you with this 10 cent razor and this beautiful blade and this beautiful
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.000]   razor is a really good shave.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.920]   It's close, no nicks, no clogs.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.520]   Now this is also very cost effective.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.120]   So in addition to just getting this beautiful tool that just works really well, you pay
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.040]   a little more upfront, but because you can just use a standard 10 cent blade in this
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.120]   beautiful razor, it doesn't take long before the cost of operating a Henson's is much cheaper
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.600]   than a subscription service.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:05.560]   It doesn't take long before the cost of operating a Henson is much cheaper than buying the plastic
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.080]   disposable blades from the drugstore.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.360]   So anyways, I love beautiful tools to do a job very well and do it cost effectively.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.540]   This is what you get with Henson's razor.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.680]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:26.040]   Visit hensonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.360]   And if you use the code CAL, you will get two years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.880]   Just make sure you add the two years of blades to your cart.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.960]   And then when you type in CAL as a promo code, the price of those blades will drop to zero.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:50.480]   It's 100 free blades when you head to h-e-n-s-o-n-s-h-a-v-i-n-g.com/cal and use that promo code CAL.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.320]   All right, well, let's move on to questions.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   No Jesse today to read the question, so I'll have to do that all by myself.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.720]   All of these roughly connect to our theme of creativity hacking.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.480]   All right, our first question comes from Maude.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:15.720]   Maude asks, I'm curious about whether Cal reads magazines, RSS feeds and or email newsletters.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.480]   And if so, how reading those media fits into his schedule.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.080]   I am pretty discriminating in terms of which magazines and newspapers and feeds I follow,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.120]   but trying to keep up takes so much time that I have little left for reading books in the
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.120]   evening.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.880]   I am really curious as to how Cal approaches this.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:40.080]   Well, Maude, there are, I'll go through my habits here and then I'll give you my reasoning.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.040]   There are some email newsletters I subscribe to.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.920]   I like email newsletters.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.040]   I read them if I can.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.280]   So I don't put pressure on myself.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.480]   If I subscribe to it, it's because I like them and I'm willing to pay money for email
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.240]   newsletters.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.120]   I'll pay money for some sub stack newsletters if I really like it.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.120]   Others are free.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.680]   I don't put pressure on myself.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.260]   They're there.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.520]   And if I have time, you know, let's say I'm taking a break, I'm eating lunch during the
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.800]   day, I'll read them.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.000]   And if I don't, and I miss the newsletter for a week or so and I don't read it, that's
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   fine too.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.560]   I don't put pressure on myself for completism that I have to read everything that comes
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.560]   out.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.160]   Now people ask, wait a second, the world without email, you don't like email.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.480]   Isn't this a problem?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.520]   Not a problem.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.000]   If you read my book, A World Without Email, what I don't like is the hyperactive hive
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.120]   mind mode of collaboration that email enabled.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.960]   It's a mode of collaboration where you work things out with back and forth messaging.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.840]   Back and forth messaging is my productivity kryptonite.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.620]   Back and forth messaging is what requires you to constantly check inboxes and constantly
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.880]   send messages back and forth.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.740]   One direction broadcast are not a source of stress.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.920]   One direction broadcast are not a source of drag on productivity.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.800]   They're actually a really good use of email.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.040]   Oh, there's some newsletters that can sit here in my inbox, tell if and when I want
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   to read them.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.200]   I don't feel compelled to keep checking my inbox to look for them and seeing a newsletter
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.840]   arrive does not make me stress.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.040]   So email newsletters I subscribe to probably half dozen, read them some weeks, some weeks
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   I don't.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.680]   Of course, I should turn this into an ad and say, if you're just a podcast listener, you
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:19.440]   should subscribe to my email newsletter at calnewport.com roughly twice a month.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.400]   I send out articles on the types of topics that we talk about here on the show.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   Okay.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.400]   What else do I do?
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.120]   I work with the New Yorker as they employ me.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.640]   This feels like it is a relevant thing to do.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.480]   My goal is typically make sure you read at least one article from each magazine and be
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   in my goal.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.720]   My role here is read the one you might not expect.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.120]   The one people might not expect you to read.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.720]   You want to try to open your mind to good writing on interesting topics.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:50.360]   I also get the daily email from the New Yorker because every day they're publishing articles
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.280]   online, right?
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.600]   This is true of most publications.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.720]   Now, there's only a handful of articles in the actual printed magazines.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.480]   So you got to follow what's going online.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.320]   They have a really good, the New Yorker daily newsletter, and I'll look through that every
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:08.080]   day and there it'll be if there's something that particularly catches my attention, then
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.600]   I'll read it.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.720]   So if something catches my attention, I'll read it online.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.340]   And then I try to read at least one article from the print magazine when I can.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.360]   The other types of online articles I read are those that you send me.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:28.440]   So my listeners and my readers send me articles and videos they think I will like to interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.960]   I don't have time to read or watch all of them, but I really do appreciate it.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.880]   And it's where I get a lot of grist for the show and other ideas.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.160]   Things will catch my attention that you send me.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.240]   And so I'll, when I check that inbox once or twice a week, I'll often find a bunch of
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.440]   articles and videos that I'll read as part of that inbox checking.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.540]   All right, so that's it.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.540]   So we add that up.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.940]   We have a lot less online information consumption than I think most people actually do.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.940]   And here's the thing.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.680]   I feel completely fine with this.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.460]   I'm up to date.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.420]   I know what's happening in the world enough.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.980]   Maybe I don't know a lot of memes and trends going on.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   That's fine.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.700]   Maybe I'm not completely up to speed on the latest controversies.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:11.700]   That's fine.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.700]   I don't want to be.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.860]   I think I come across as sufficiently erudite, as sufficiently up to speed, as sufficiently
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.860]   knowledgeable.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.100]   And so what I think happens is, is that we have in our modern attention economy world,
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:29.580]   we have adjusted, we have adjusted our understanding of the world to the realities of massive amounts
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.260]   of money being invested in the getting us to look at stuff online.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:36.740]   And we've adjusted our reality of the world to tell ourselves, it's very important that
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.520]   I keep up with all of these things.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:47.160]   So our perspective on information flow adjusted to the modified information flow, the greatly
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.100]   magnified and accelerated information flow of the 21st century, it says this must be
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.100]   important.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.380]   I need to keep up with all of this.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.620]   And what I'm saying, you don't.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.040]   You don't.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.140]   You don't have to be reading hours, articles a day, read books.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.460]   You have some email newsletters.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.460]   I don't know.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.760]   Have a magazine you like to read when you can.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.780]   Don't be stressed when you can and mainly read books and do other stuff and watch cool
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.300]   movies and you'll be fine.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.540]   That would be fine, but your anxiety level will probably go down.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:19.260]   To be so plugged into all this online chatter, it just really makes you feel like the world
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:23.260]   is about to fall apart and civil wars around the corner and the earth will be destroyed
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.600]   by Thursday.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.960]   You stop consuming all that online information and suddenly you feel a lot more peaceful.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.300]   So no, I don't read a ton online and the stuff I do read, I don't mind when I miss.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.300]   All right.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.900]   Next question is from Ryan.
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.380]   Ryan says, I have an Apple watch.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:47.460]   I've had an Apple watch since the series zero, but in hindsight, I'd let it serve as a constant
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.260]   and consistent distraction.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.300]   That is until very recently.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.780]   In the past few months, I have disabled all notifications peeing through the watch other
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.960]   than phone calls and set up my text messages to only notify me if someone responds to a
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.540]   prompt and essentially says, yes, this is urgent.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:07.500]   Well, I think these were the correct steps to take to regain my time and concentration.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.340]   I have often toyed with the idea of switching to a traditional dumb watch, but every time
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.480]   I take the Apple watch off for a bit, I end up getting what I would describe as anxiety
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.820]   around my metrics because I am very fitness oriented.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.060]   Am I creating excuses to keep myself from breaking this technological tie?
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:32.140]   Well, I included this question in part because of a warning.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.940]   The warning being if you're doing creativity hacking and let's say you're trying to use
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:42.980]   a novel stimulation and avoidance of the familiar, you're using those two mechanisms to try to
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.740]   amplify the originality and creativity of your thinking.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.740]   It is not hard at all to sabotage those efforts.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:59.060]   In particular, the avoidance of the familiar mechanism is easily defied and your phone
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:04.980]   or an Apple watch are fantastic ways to defy that advantage because as soon as you're being
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:14.020]   exposed to text conversations and emails, as soon as you're connected back to a familiar
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.500]   flow of conversations, you have negated most of that advantage.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.860]   Those will fire up huge portions of your brain to be like, "Oh, yes.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.860]   Okay.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.940]   I just got a text from Ben.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.780]   Let me think through what does this mean?
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.780]   What do I need to do?
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.780]   Well, what am I going to write back?
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.380]   Well, we're running back now, but what am I going to say?"
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.860]   And you've just hijacked a big portion of your brain and the effect of the fact that
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.540]   you're on the beach or in the middle of a museum somewhere, that effect has now diminished
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.540]   dramatically.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:46.020]   So you have to be very careful about sabotaging what makes novel locations so useful for having
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.020]   creative thinking.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.020]   All right.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.460]   So Ryan, in your case, do you need to get a dumb watch?
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:54.100]   I'm a big dumb watch guy, a mechanical watch.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.740]   Psychologically, I like that.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.540]   There's no battery in my Omega.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.140]   You just hand crank it.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.140]   Do you need to do that?
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:07.100]   No, if you're a fitness buff and you do tracking of metrics on your watch, you don't want to
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.660]   necessarily give up those advantage.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.660]   Fitness is important.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.660]   But the answer here is so simple.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.000]   Just turn everything else off.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.580]   Just make your Apple Watch into a dumb watch and use it just for fitness tracking.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.580]   No notifications, no email.
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.580]   All right.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.580]   That's it.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.700]   So if you worry about it, do that.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.220]   And you probably should worry about it, again, at least in the circumstances where you're
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:30.780]   trying to do deep or creative thinking, because it doesn't take much to sabotage those creativity
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.260]   hacking mechanisms.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.700]   We have another question here.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.620]   This one is from Fahad.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:42.000]   He says, when it comes to developing brilliant ideas, who has the advantages?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.140]   Those who live in the city or those who live in the country?
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:50.460]   It's a good question, Fahad, because I normally live in a city, but just got back from a summer
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.860]   in the country.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.620]   Well, there is no clear answer, but we know why there's no clear answer, because in the
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:01.460]   beginning of the show, we went through the three different mechanisms that help explain
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.300]   why locations can help induce more creativity.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:13.220]   So the city and the country draw from overlapping but not identical sets of advantageous mechanisms,
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   right?
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.820]   So the city, for example, in particular, is very good at factor one in a way that maybe
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.060]   the country is not.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:24.940]   So that factor one is the whiteboard effect.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:31.500]   This is Stephen Johnson famously talking about liquid intelligence networks.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.900]   When you're around a lot of other people, there's just a lot of ideas in the air.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.620]   There's smart people to talk to.
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:40.860]   You constantly can bring in my writer friend, my philosopher friend, my movie director friend.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.100]   We all got together at this party to celebrate our painter friend who just had a show, and
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.920]   you're awash in ideas.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.880]   You can go see interesting talks.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.680]   You can go to interesting exhibits.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.820]   So you can be around smart people and really interesting ideas more easily, because there's
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.620]   just more people.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.860]   Cities attract a lot more people, attracts a lot more thinkers.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.700]   There's a lot more events going on.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.240]   It's also a lot easier just to get together with other people.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.760]   The friends of mine who have moved to the country often will on regular occasions come
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.140]   back to the city in part so that they can hang out with a bunch of people who don't
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.960]   happen to live where they are out there in the country.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.300]   So the city is really good at that.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:27.420]   The city also has probably a larger menu of choices for novel locations to go to, because
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.700]   you have museums and you have art galleries, and there's probably a university and all
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.200]   these different coffee shops.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.780]   So there's a lot of different options, like the concentration circuit I showed at the
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.660]   opening of the show in Washington, DC.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.660]   It's got those options.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.940]   Those are advantages.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:51.740]   I think the country has the advantages of more powerfully dramatic novel locations.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.740]   So nature in particular is really novel.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.140]   The thing with the city is everything is kind of crowded, so there is some difference.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:04.060]   Even if you're in a museum that's different than your office, it's still sort of the same
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.180]   people, lots of people, people on their phone.
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:13.700]   It's different, but it's not as different as I'm on top of Mount Cardigan in New Hampshire.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:21.220]   Quiet mountain, the wind is going by, and I'm looking out over the hills in the distance.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.220]   It's more powerful novelty.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.820]   Also a more powerful avoidance of the familiar, because when you're going to novel locations
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:33.820]   in the country, it's often locations that are in nature and really, really different
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.820]   from not being in nature.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.140]   Or again, in the city, the differences are not as strong.
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.140]   There's really something powerful.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.860]   So I think the city has that advantage.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:47.540]   This is not directly one of the mechanisms, but I think it's indirectly one of the mechanisms.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:51.140]   What I learned up in Hanover is things are just slower.
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.140]   It's not a lot of crowds.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.960]   It's not a lot of cars on the road.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.460]   You're not having that anxiety of trying to monitor and keep track of you among lots of
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.500]   other different people.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:07.700]   I think that hits on that mechanism that we discussed before of the familiar.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:15.020]   So there's just not as much stimuli, social crowd, people stimuli, tickling your brain
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.020]   in the country.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.020]   So that's an advantage too.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.020]   So both have advantages.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.100]   And so we understand why it's possible to say the answer is both, because we understand
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.300]   there's different mechanisms at play when you deploy location to amplify creativity
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.900]   and the city and the country leaning the different.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.900]   What's the right thing to do?
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.500]   Chess your personality or do what I did this year.
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.860]   Easy, right?
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.660]   Get a fellowship in the country and go do that in the summer and then come back to the
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.900]   city for the rest of your just everyone should just do that simple.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.860]   All right, let's do another question here.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:48.860]   This one comes from a new.
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:55.580]   He says, I've been trying to cultivate a deep life since I first read your books in 2019.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.860]   Four years in, I'm known for solving complex problem no one else seems to want to tackle
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.580]   and I'm shining at work because I limit my exposure to the hive mind.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:09.780]   Now I'm trying to get to the next level, which is my own research projects in writing.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.380]   How should I approach organizing my writing goals and organize my thoughts on disparate
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.940]   topics and projects?
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:22.500]   All right, well, I like this in part because what we're looking to do here is build a creativity
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.020]   hacking game plan for a new.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.920]   He already and I love this piece because this is like a case study, a mini case study.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.380]   He already is enjoying success by being separated from the hive mind in his works.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.060]   Now he's known for solving more complex problems and he wants to push that to the next level.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.580]   But let's just pause for a moment on that mini case study.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:48.780]   Right, because a lot of people are worried about disconnecting themselves more from the
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:53.820]   hyperactive hive mind, not being in the regular flow of back and forth emails and slack.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:57.520]   They're worried that the inconvenience, they're going to cause people inconvenience and that's
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.460]   all that matters and their stock will fall in that position.
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.780]   They'll get yelled at or they'll lose their job.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.780]   Doesn't always happen.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   Look what I knew here.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:11.820]   I limited my exposure to the hive mind, but instead I concentrated hard on problems that
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:16.180]   mattered and now he's known within his company, oh, this is the guy that does hard problems.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.460]   He actually generated more career capital because the hive mind doesn't generate career
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.540]   capital.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.720]   It's not a rare and valuable skill to be accessible.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.020]   It's not a rare and valuable skill to answer email threads quickly, but it does take away
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.900]   time and cognitive cycles from stuff that does matter.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.260]   So it's an interesting calculus.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:36.020]   Less hive mind became more valuable.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.140]   All right, so Anu, how do we push this to the next level?
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:45.380]   Well, first of all, do the multi-scale creativity hacking strategy I described at the beginning
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.020]   of the show.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.820]   Have a location that you can use every day when you're doing deep work to separate from
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.120]   the location where you do everything else.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.500]   Make it distinctive.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.700]   Every week put aside a non-trivial amount of time to actually go somewhere, to leave
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:04.380]   the normal building or house or location where you work, to go somewhere that's much more
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:10.460]   novel, the woods, a museum, a library, to have an extended creative session where you're
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:15.980]   really trying at this point to amplify the uniqueness and the novelty, the lack of the
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.260]   familiar.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:22.140]   Every season, roughly speaking, have some sort of brain trust get together.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.380]   And you get together with other smart people working on similar problems and you go to
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.040]   a novel location and you present information and think together and leverage the whiteboard
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:34.000]   effect to really try to find the best ideas, to really try to push your thinking to the
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.080]   next level.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.700]   Do that multi-scale creativity hacking and you're already going to find yourself moving
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.780]   up to the next level.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.980]   All right, so I think that's a really good place to start.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.140]   A couple of things I would throw in there, make sure you're exposing yourself regularly
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.820]   to interesting and relevant material, read interesting wide variety of books, listen
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.020]   to interesting podcast interviews, go to talks.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.540]   Also make sure you have a good system to capture ideas as you're working on it.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.740]   It can be as simple as just starting a document for every potential idea you're going to work
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:10.940]   on or you can capture thoughts on that as they arise.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.220]   You might have multiple documents going for multiple ideas.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:20.740]   Finally, I'll say be patient about starting on something new.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:25.260]   So when the quality of the idea matters, patience matters as well.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.500]   Be hesitant to get started.
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.340]   You know, I'm working on this idea and that idea, I'm kind of growing these documents
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:35.220]   only after something really, really seems like this is, I can't avoid this anymore.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.900]   It's a great idea.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.140]   I have the right pieces here.
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.300]   I see how it's going to come together.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.080]   I have signs that this is a great thing to work on.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.540]   Only then should you pull the trigger to work on it.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:50.620]   And then I want you to deploy slow productivity, steady but relentless.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.820]   Again and again, you just keep coming back to it.
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.020]   Most days, not all.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:59.700]   Go to your deep work location, push hard, but not an excessive amount of time.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.700]   Slow and steady accumulation.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.620]   Not, I'm going to just crush it for this weekend and get it done.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.940]   Slow but relentless, pile up intense concentration on an idea once you can't help but start
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.940]   it.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.300]   Don't worry about how long it takes.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.340]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.980]   What matters is steady progress until this thing finishes.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.860]   So do all those different types of things anew and you're going to put yourself to the
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.180]   next level of original creative thinking.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.900]   All right, let's do one more question here.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.780]   This one comes from Reading Guy.
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.980]   Reading Guy says, "Do you remember a time when reading books from other genres that
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:38.500]   are totally unrelated to your field has helped you in thinking about or directly contributing
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.900]   to your work as a professor or a writer?"
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.820]   Reading Guy, I read all sorts of genres all the time.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.940]   I don't have a set genre of book that I read from.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.140]   I love the diversity.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.020]   Go back and look at my reading reports.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:58.140]   Every month we put on the podcast, here's the five books I read the month before.
[00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.140]   They are all over the place.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.900]   I'm reading a book right now about deep sea exploration.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.700]   I just finished a thriller novel about, believe it or not, werewolves.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:16.660]   Before that, I read a Kenneth Galbraith book on economic policy from the mid-century.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:20.740]   I'm all over the place and I'm always pulling interesting ideas from these books.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:21.780]   It happens all the time.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.500]   So I think about reading in different genres.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:31.580]   I think about that like the cognitive equivalent of working in novel spaces.
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:35.620]   It's the internal equivalent of going to the museum or the beach to think.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.500]   It's because you're exposing the interior of your mind, the place where ideas are stored
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.820]   and thought about, to all sorts of different ideas.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:48.780]   So it can be just as important to have cognitive diversity as it is to have physical diversity.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:49.780]   This happens all the time.
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.140]   So look for example, I'll give you one concrete example.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.020]   You asked for a concrete example.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:00.100]   Last year I published a New Yorker piece on what we can learn about knowledge work from
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.660]   looking back at how early humans worked.
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.580]   You'll see a bunch of books cited in there.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.980]   These are books of anthropology, anthropology books.
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:14.700]   They're looking back and studying extant hunter-gatherer communities or looking at
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.940]   archaeological evidence.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:19.660]   I had just read some books like that because why not?
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:24.900]   And that was the seed of this idea of we could learn from this lessons for modern work.
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.300]   I wrote a big New Yorker piece on it.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.820]   In my new book on slow productivity, I have the same ideas.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.220]   So there's a concrete example.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:35.900]   So yes, read broadly with nonfiction.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.460]   With that in mind, I want to talk briefly about another sponsor that makes this show
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:42.500]   possible and a sponsor that is relevant to that last question.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.780]   And that is our friends at Blinkist.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.140]   All right.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:52.620]   So Blinkist is a subscription service that gives you access to short summaries of over
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:58.860]   5,500 nonfiction titles spread through 27 different categories.
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:03.660]   These summaries, which they call Blinks, take about 15 minutes to read or listen to.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:08.300]   So you can listen to the summary or you can read it right there in the app.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:13.420]   Well, this is a great way, as we just talked about in the answer to my last question, a
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.340]   great way to expose yourself to interesting books and other genres because you don't have
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.380]   to know a lot about that genre to find what you want to read.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:26.220]   Instead, you should do what I do, what Jesse does, which is you add to a list the books
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:31.580]   you're thinking about maybe reading, and before you purchase a book, you go to Blinkist and
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.900]   you read or listen to the Blink.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:38.100]   And in that short summary of the book, you get a lot of information about, is this something
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.900]   I want to actually read the entire book of or do I just want to take these main points
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.900]   and move on?
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:48.200]   It is a triage service for the reading life.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.820]   If you are a big reader and you read a lot of nonfiction, you have to have something
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.260]   like Blinkist.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.940]   Jesse and I use it for exactly this purpose.
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.060]   You'd be surprised how easy it is to determine once you've listened to a summary.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   Nope, nope, yes.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.500]   Like, okay, I know what this book is about.
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.500]   That's not what I thought.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.500]   Let me put that aside.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.740]   Oh, this sounds fascinating.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.020]   Let me buy that book.
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:16.140]   There's also a cool feature going on right now called Blinkist Connect, which allows
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.340]   you with a subscription to Blinkist to give a subscription to a friend for free.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:28.540]   It's a two for the price of one deal, which I think your friends will appreciate.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:33.460]   So I'm just looking here at my, I was looking here at my list.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:38.860]   Honestly, what I'm looking at right now, guys, is my Blinkist app.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:45.180]   I have this off camera and I was just looking at this to emphasize the utility it has in
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.700]   my actual day to day life.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:51.780]   Well, anyways, I don't want to, I was trying to find a way to put my screen up to the camera
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:52.780]   here.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.300]   That's not going to work well, but let me just leave it at this.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.620]   It is something I use.
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.620]   It is something you should consider using for triaging your nonfiction reading.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.620]   All right.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.660]   So right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:37.240]   I also want to talk about our friends at Ladder.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:43.560]   If you're like me, you're my age, one of the things you know that's on your list is life
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.560]   insurance.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.560]   Maybe you have some, but it's not nearly enough.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.360]   Maybe you don't have any at all, and you're very worried about your loved ones being left
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.200]   in the lurch if something tragic happened.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.400]   So knowing that importance of life insurance, why don't you have any?
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:02.840]   Well, for a lot of people, it's because it's ambiguous how to do it.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   Where do you go?
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.800]   Who do you talk to?
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.680]   What's a good price or a bad price?
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.800]   This is where Ladder enters the scene.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:15.560]   It makes it so simple to check that item, get more life insurance off your to-do list.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.480]   It's 100% digital.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.240]   There's no doctors, needles, or paperwork involved when you're applying for $3 million
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.720]   in coverage or less.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.400]   You just answer a few questions about your health in an application.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.280]   You need just a few minutes and a phone or a laptop to apply, and then their smart algorithms
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.920]   will work in real time.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.520]   You will find out if you're instantly approved.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.520]   There's no hidden fees.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   You can cancel any time.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.800]   You get a full refund if you change your mind in the first 30 days.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:45.600]   These are policies that are insured by insurers with long proven histories of paying claims,
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.320]   insurers that are rated A and A+ by AM Best.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:53.200]   All right, so you just go online, click approved.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   Here it is.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.200]   Here's the price.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   Do I want it?
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   Let's go.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.720]   Highly rated insurers.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.240]   We got 4.8 out of 5 stars on Trustpilot.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.400]   They made Forbes Best Life Insurance list.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:10.680]   All right, so it is just the easy way to get good, affordable, high quality term life insurance.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   Since life insurance costs more each year that you age, what's the right time to take
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.880]   this off your list?
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.140]   Right now.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.000]   The more you wait, the more expensive it gets.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.880]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today to see if you're instantly approved.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:31.700]   That's L-A-D-D-E-R life.com/deep.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.840]   That's ladderlife.com/deep.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:38.720]   All right, we got one more segment left in the show.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:45.040]   I want to react to something that has been going around the internet recently.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   So I'm actually going to share something on the screen here.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:55.520]   So again, this is the deeplife.com or youtube.com/calnewportmedia to watch this episode, episode 262.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.920]   I'm loading up a YouTube video.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.800]   I won't have the audio on, but I have closed captioning on.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.720]   All right, so this is a video from Better Ideas, a popular channel.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.600]   It's 2 million subscribers.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:11.280]   And the title of this video is "How Overstimulation is Ruining Your Life."
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:17.160]   And we see there's a young man on screen here in the woods looking earnestly at the camera.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.320]   And I have the closed captioning on.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.560]   So I'm going to play this and read you a little bit of what he's saying.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.360]   He's saying, "During certain periods of my life..."
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.360]   Oh, that.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.560]   Remember when I said the volume was off?
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   The volume was very much on.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   Let me turn that off here.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.560]   Sorry about that.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   All right.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:41.160]   "During various periods of my life, I have a very difficult time focusing on pretty much
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.860]   anything important or difficult.
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:50.160]   During these periods, it seems almost impossible to break out of the social media limbo where
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:55.440]   you're just constantly switching between tabs, refreshing pages, kind of waiting for something
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:01.300]   interesting to happen, like for someone to post a cool photo or Instagram or something.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.560]   You're kind of waiting to be entertained.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.440]   But if you actually have to apply yourself, it's extremely difficult, borderline painful
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.520]   to do so.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.720]   And I'm pretty sure almost everyone can relate to this problem.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.280]   I'm sure you've seen a lot of videos on YouTube giving you little tips and tricks as to how
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.800]   to better focus, including my own channel.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:24.320]   But there are very few videos kind of diving in, talking about why it's so difficult to
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.520]   focus on hard things.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.160]   You know, like what's the deal?
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.920]   Why can't we just sit down and do something important with very little strain?"
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   All right.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.800]   So that's the start of that video on better ideas.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.320]   And he goes on to get into some of the neuroscience of why we're distracted so easily when we're
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.240]   trying to work on something hard.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.920]   And it's a neuroscience explanation you may have heard before, but essentially our dopamine
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:55.720]   system, which generates that urge to do something that's going to generate a reward.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.920]   Keep in mind, we often get that a little bit wrong.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:03.280]   I think in common parlance, we often think about dopamine as being a source of rewards.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.400]   The dopamine itself is what makes you feel a lot of pleasure.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.200]   Now, dopamine is what gives you that urge to do the thing that you think is going to
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.360]   give you the reward.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.720]   It's when you have an addiction, it's the dopamine that makes it so irresistible to
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:20.880]   grab that cigarette because it wants the other rewards you're going to get when you actually
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.700]   smoke the cigarette, right?
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:27.120]   So what is talked about in this video is this common neuroscience explanation that the dopamine
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:34.240]   system is firing up to get those quick hit rewards of seeing the video that's really
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:39.140]   interesting, seeing the post that's a little bit scandalous, seeing the like number jump
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.560]   on something you did earlier, which gives you this big burst of people like me, they
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.200]   really like me.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.360]   The dopamine system likes rewards.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.000]   It wants rewards now.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.480]   The internet has many rewards lined up.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:57.400]   That system kicks into play and you feel this irresistible desire to click, click, click.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:04.800]   You do not get a similar dopamine push for I'm working for our 900 of 10,000.
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:09.880]   It's going to take me to finish this really big project because the reward's not proximate.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.400]   And so what's going to win then?
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:15.880]   The complicated deep thing, part of your slow productivity push to do something big over
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:20.000]   a long period of time or Instagram or Tik Tok.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   And he said, yeah, your brain is wired to go for that.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.200]   And that's a very hard, that's a very hard challenge to win.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.400]   And now what I learned from this video is that yes, he is right.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.600]   There are lots of videos that talk about this same thing, quote unquote overstimulation.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.720]   People are really feeling it.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:39.280]   And I think young people are feeling it harder because they have more targets for their dopamine
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   systems.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.840]   They have more acclimatized their mind to all of these various rewards.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.520]   They're very good at these various rewards.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:49.320]   There's so much pulling at them that young people in particular are really finding.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.600]   Yes, this is ruining my life.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:58.520]   I can't do anything long-term, deep, cognitively useful, getting bad grades at school.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.000]   I can't advance in my job.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.720]   I can't produce something that I really want to produce.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:10.040]   Those of us my age or older, maybe say I distract myself too much and it slows down me doing
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.760]   important work.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.920]   Young people really do feel like it's ruining their lives.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920]   So what should we do about it?
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.640]   Well, I thought, well, I can offer my own advice here.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.000]   I mean, this is something I've studied and written about for a long time.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.760]   I kind of wrote the definitive book on the power of focus and why you should cultivate
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   it.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.000]   I've been thinking and writing articles and books about this for a long time.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.320]   So I figured, let me, let me review here on the podcast, my own very complicated multi-part
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.040]   system for combating online overstimulation.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.800]   So get a pad of paper ready because you don't want to miss step nine or 10.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.160]   There's a very complicated explanation for how you're going to have to very carefully
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.760]   navigate the online world.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   All right.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   So it's going to be very complicated.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:51.760]   Are you ready?
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.760]   Okay, here it goes.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760]   Here's my solution.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.880]   Don't use things that cause overstimulation.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   All right.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:04.560]   I'm being a little bit facetious here, but honestly, the answer is as simple as that.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.860]   Dopamine system is powerful.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.520]   So don't give it the targets that it's going to fire up for.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:16.980]   You have to actually remove most of these sources of overstimulation from your life.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:23.520]   If you really want to start thinking and producing original thoughts at a high level, there's
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.760]   not these complex habits and careful ways of navigating your notifications and when
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.760]   you use this and when you don't use this.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.320]   I'm telling you this as someone who thinks for a living and studies people who thinks
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.720]   for a living, the more sources of overstimulation you eliminate from your life, the easier.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.840]   And we of course know this type of abstention approach is effective because we see it with
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:51.760]   other things that historically have hijacked the dopamine system and caused a lot of trouble.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.240]   We do not tell people who have an issue with smoking, okay, we need to build a complex
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.240]   system of where you have cigarettes and where you don't, and you don't want to have it
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.760]   in the car, but you will have it here.
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.200]   And we're going to have an app that keeps track of how many cigarettes you've had and
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.960]   then try to restrict, and then during certain periods, there's a time lock that locks off
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.560]   the cigarettes and you can't have it during that period, but you can have it on this period.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.520]   And we do a week on, but you don't smoke on Saturdays.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.440]   No, we just say you got to quit smoking.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:24.000]   As the same with a lot of other addictions like this that people have trouble with, but
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   we resist applying that type of clarity and abstention to online overstimulation.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.440]   So let me get a little bit more granular about this.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.660]   Social media, this is a big source of it.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.720]   You got to just basically get this out of your life.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.560]   If you have to have some social media for professional reasons, it should not be on
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560]   your phone.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.720]   It should be on a boring computer.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.500]   It's something you should do on a schedule or hire someone to do on your behalf.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.720]   It should never, ever be something you go to when you're bored.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.960]   It should never be a source of distraction.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:03.680]   It should be, I'm an author and I set up my Instagram post in a shared document on Google
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.080]   Drive.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.040]   Here's the photos, here's the text, and I have someone who posts it Fridays and Mondays.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.080]   Or if I have to do that, I log in the thing on my computer, I post it, and then I shut
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.080]   it back down again.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.080]   All right?
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.920]   So if you have to use it professionally, it's on a computer, it's boring, you never use
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.240]   it as a source of entertainment.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.080]   You don't scroll online news.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.640]   Look, you're not a editor at Gawker.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.460]   You just get out of that world of online news and discussion.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.200]   You don't have to be a part of it.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.580]   How do you keep up with stuff in the world?
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:40.440]   We talked about this earlier in this episode where I gave advice to Reading Guy.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:43.960]   You know, subscribe to some email newsletters that you read when you can that gives you
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.840]   interesting perspectives.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:50.160]   Listen to podcasts, maybe listen to a daily news roundup podcast if you want to be kept
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.720]   up with more current events.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.680]   Or listen to something like Sager and Crystal's, their Breaking Points podcast where they go
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.800]   through 10 stories about what's going on in the world.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800]   Podcasts are fine, right?
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.480]   Because it's something you have to turn on and listen to.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:10.560]   It's not a knee-jerk distraction that your dopamine system is going to kick into.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.960]   No one is like trying to write and halfway through writing, they're like, "Ahh!"
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.000]   And quickly turn on a podcast.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.400]   TikTok can do that.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   Online news can do that.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400]   Twitter can do that.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   Podcasts are fine.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400]   Newsletters are fine.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.880]   Maybe even print out the articles you like and read them when you get a chance.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   That's fine.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   You'll be informed.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.120]   You got to get rid of all that online news.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120]   What about YouTube?
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120]   YouTube is tricky.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   Why is YouTube tricky?
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:38.200]   I think video is the future of independent content creation, but the recommendations
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:44.200]   sidebar on YouTube can make it into one of these dopamine-inflamming sources of distraction.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:50.400]   So when it comes to something like YouTube, you have to use it one way and not another.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.800]   So this is maybe the place where I come closest to the navigation lines that you hear in a
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.160]   lot of these online videos.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.200]   But I do think YouTube is a source of information.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:07.120]   YouTube has become more a source of entertainment, high-quality entertainment that rivals what
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.760]   you would get on TV, but it's also a giant source of distraction.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.720]   So how do we make sense of YouTube?
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:17.080]   Well, here's my YouTube strategy.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.920]   So in order to preserve YouTube as a way to look up instructions for things, which I think
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:26.080]   is a great use of YouTube, how do I change the oil in a Honda Odyssey?
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.120]   Look it up on YouTube.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.520]   You can see a video of someone doing it.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.160]   It's better than trying to find an article.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.520]   To preserve that use of YouTube without it making a dopamine-inflamming system, get one
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:42.520]   of these plugins for your browser that you use YouTube on that gets rid of the recommendations.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.880]   So what you can do is you can search for something.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880]   You can see the search results.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.960]   You can click on a search result.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.360]   You can watch it, but there's no, "Here's what's coming up next," or "What about this
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.680]   and what about that?"
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:58.660]   So that one type of plugin alone makes YouTube into a fantastic library without it being
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.360]   something that you can use as a source of knee-jerk distraction.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.240]   Because again, when you're working on something hard, if you have blocked YouTube, you go,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.920]   "Oh, I'm just going to YouTube.com."
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   You don't see anything.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.160]   You have to search for something and find something.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:14.000]   It's not a highly salient source of distraction.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.680]   Now what about entertainment on YouTube?
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.080]   Because again, I think this is actually important.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.200]   I'm a believer that video trumps audio.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.720]   The future of independent content is going to be video.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.680]   I mean, this is like radio became a big thing until television was around, and then television
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.960]   just smashed the market share of radio.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.420]   It was just so much bigger because humans like to see faces.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.480]   Humans like to see visuals.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:42.600]   And I increasingly believe watching a high-quality interview show on YouTube is better than 99%
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:49.840]   of the stuff that's on television or that's on non-unscripted streaming services.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.480]   And I think that gap's going to close more.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.500]   So how do you, for example, watch a show like mine?
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.680]   Or maybe you're a Lex Fridman fan.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.820]   You want to watch his interviews.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:03.600]   How do you watch these type of programming as a substitute for lower-quality television
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.900]   with, again, not having YouTube be a rabbit hole?
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.680]   And my answer here is television sets.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.800]   I learned this from our YouTube guide, Jeremy, that increasingly televisions are becoming
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:23.360]   one of the most common devices on which this style of YouTube video is watched.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.520]   So if you're going to look something up, you have a browser with a plugin that blocks the
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.080]   recommendations.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:35.000]   If you're going to watch "independent high-quality content" on YouTube, you have it on the YouTube
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.600]   app and your Apple TV or Fire Stick on your television.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.140]   And you watch it like you would any other television show in the same circumstances
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.480]   where you'd watch television.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.960]   I'm sitting down with a lunch break.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.160]   I take out my remote.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.160]   I turn on the TV.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.160]   I go to the YouTube app.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.960]   I search for the latest episode of whatever, and I put it on the TV.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.880]   There's a lot of friction in using a television.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.120]   There's also a lot of routine and ritual built into televisions where that's not part of
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.200]   your dopamine cycle.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.160]   When you're in your home office trying to write something, you don't rush downstairs
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.760]   and turn on the TV and go to Netflix and select a show and turn it on.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.480]   That's too much overhead.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.960]   The television, you think about, "Oh, I'm going to have a meal.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.480]   I'm taking a break."
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.360]   It's a big production to get it going.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.560]   So you move high-quality independent media consumption to the television and looking
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:29.400]   up to a plugin-protected browser, now you don't have to worry about something like YouTube
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.840]   in your life being a source of distraction.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:40.560]   Also throw in place better, less dopamine-susceptible entertainment sources to fill the gap that
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:46.040]   the highly salient distracting content is probably filling right now.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.280]   And get back into music.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.760]   Go see good movies and read about them before and after.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.240]   Read much more books.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.760]   High-quality streaming content.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.360]   High-quality podcasts.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:04.280]   Get your mind used to other sorts of much higher-quality content for the entertainment
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.560]   and distraction.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.880]   The lower-quality stuff will begin to seem less palatable.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   Same thing happens with food.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.800]   You eat a lot of junk food.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.800]   It's really addictive.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.360]   "My God, I just need chips and cookies and this makes me feel better.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.640]   What else would I want to eat?"
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.640]   You stop doing it for a while.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   You start eating better food.
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.760]   You start cooking yourself.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.920]   You go to the farmer's market.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.560]   You're using high-quality ingredients.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.760]   Everyone will tell you this.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.080]   You start eating well.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.920]   A Snickers bar or a Chips Ahoy seems weird.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   It's cardboard.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.920]   It's fake.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920]   It's too sugary.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920]   You don't crave it anymore.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.700]   So you don't break this connection to junk food by just white-knuckling and eating less.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.960]   You replace it with better food.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.920]   So that's the final part of solving overstimulation is introducing, flooding the zone with much
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:52.800]   more quality stimulation so that you lose your taste for a TikTok video.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.720]   You lose your taste for an inflammatory online article that someone tweeted and that you're
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.000]   scrolling through and then clicking the other links.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.800]   So again, this is how I think you solve overstimulation.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.480]   If you're serious about it, you get rid of most of the sources of overstimulation.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:13.160]   You stop using social media, you stop doing online news surfing, you put in a lot of high-quality
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.160]   content.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.160]   And in the few places where you might need to encounter these worlds, YouTube, looking
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.120]   things up, or high-quality independent media, you have to do some limited social media for
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.120]   your work.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   You do so in a way that makes it so far from being a source of knee-jerk distraction that
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.960]   your dopamine system forgets about it.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.440]   So anyways, I appreciated that video.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.440]   Overstimulation is a problem.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.080]   I'm glad people care about it.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.920]   But let's just get blunt.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:42.000]   Stop doing the thing that's ruining your life.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   Stop smoking.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.600]   Stop eating the junk food.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.740]   Replace it with something better.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:47.920]   Let's not get too cute about this.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.680]   Let's not get too fine-grained.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.920]   Life without the overstimulation really is a deeper life.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.320]   It really is a more intellectually engaged life.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.360]   It really is going to be a more successful life.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.200]   You are going to produce ideas that astound you.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.080]   All right, well, that's all the time we have for today.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.440]   Thank you for listening or watching.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.200]   I'll be back next week with Jesse in the Deep Work HQ.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.320]   The band's back together.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   Time for fall.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.200]   Time to get back to the way we were before the summer.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.240]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.080]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.960]   [MUSIC]
