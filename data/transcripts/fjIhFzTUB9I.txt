[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   So a crazy question, but I work a lot with machine learning, with deep learning.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.000]   I'm not sure if you touch that world much, but you could think of programming as a thing
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.520]   that takes some input.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.320]   Programming is the task of creating a program, and a program takes some input and produces
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.880]   some output.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.040]   So machine learning systems train on data in order to be able to take in input and produce
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.480]   output.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.200]   But they're messy, fuzzy things, much like we as children grow up.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.240]   We take some input, we make some output, but we're noisy.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.240]   We mess up a lot.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.560]   We're definitely not reliable.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.680]   Biological systems are a giant mess.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.560]   So there's a sense in which machine learning is a kind of way of programming, but just
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560]   fuzzy.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:03.560]   It's very, very, very different than C++, because C++ is, just like you said, it's extremely
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.320]   reliable, it's efficient, you can measure, you can test it in a bunch of different ways.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   With biological systems or machine learning systems, you can't say much except sort of
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.200]   empirically saying that 99.8% of the time it seems to work.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.880]   What do you think about this fuzzy kind of programming?
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.760]   Do you even see it as programming?
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.240]   Is it totally another kind of world?
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.720]   I think it's a different kind of world, and it is fuzzy.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   And in my domain, I don't like fuzziness.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.200]   That is, people say things like they want everybody to be able to program, but I don't
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.680]   want everybody to program my airplane controls or the car controls.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.400]   I want that to be done by engineers.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.640]   I want that to be done with people that are specifically educated and trained for doing,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.960]   building things, and it is not for everybody.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.000]   Similarly, a language like C++ is not for everybody.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.560]   It is generated to be a sharp and effective tool for professionals, basically, and definitely
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.680]   for people who aim at some kind of precision.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.800]   You don't have people doing calculations without understanding math, right?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.720]   Counting on your finger is not going to cut it if you want to fly to the moon.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:55.480]   And so there are areas where an 84% accuracy rate, 16% false positive rate is perfectly
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.040]   acceptable and where people will probably get no more than 70.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.160]   You said 98%.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.600]   What I have seen is more like 84, and by really a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, you can
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.800]   get up to 92 and a half.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:22.400]   So this is fine if it is, say, pre-screening stuff before the human look at it.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   It is not good enough for life-threatening situations.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.560]   And so there's lots of areas where the fuzziness is perfectly acceptable and good and better
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.040]   than humans, cheaper than humans, but it's not the kind of engineering stuff I'm mostly
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.400]   interested in.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.160]   I worry a bit about machine learning in the context of cars.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.040]   You know much more about this than I do.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.320]   I worry too.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.280]   But I'm sort of an amateur here.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.600]   I've read some of the papers, but I've not ever done it.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:07.280]   And the idea that scares me the most is the one I have heard, and I don't know how common
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:20.640]   it is, that you have this AI system, machine learning, all of these trained neural nets,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.280]   and when there's something that's too complicated, they ask the human for help.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   But the human is reading a book or asleep, and he has 30 seconds or three seconds to
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.040]   figure out what the problem was that the AI system couldn't handle and do the right thing.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   This is scary.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.800]   I mean, how do you do the cut over between the machine and the human?
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.440]   It's very, very difficult.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.640]   And for the designer of one of the most reliable, efficient, and powerful programming languages,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.920]   C++, I can understand why that world is actually unappealing.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.040]   It is for most engineers.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   To me, it's extremely appealing because we don't know how to get that interaction right,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.880]   but I think it's possible.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.480]   But it's very, very hard.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   It is.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.240]   And I was stating a problem, not a solution.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   That is impossible.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.160]   I would much rather never rely on a human.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.760]   If you're driving a nuclear reactor or an autonomous vehicle, it's much better to design
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.840]   systems written in C++ that never ask human for help.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.520]   Let's just get one fact in.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.880]   All of this AI stuff is on top of C++.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.560]   So that's one reason I have to keep a weather eye out on what's going on in that field,
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   but I will never become an expert in that area.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.440]   But it's a good example of how you separate different areas of applications and you have
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.440]   to have different tools, different principles, and they interact.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.240]   No major system today is written in one language, and there are good reasons for that.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.980]   [END]
