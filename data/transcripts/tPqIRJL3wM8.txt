[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260]   How do you think about the contribution of Anthropic to that
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.720]   increasing in the scope of this industry?
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.760]   I think a mature way to think about these things is not to deny that there are any
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.960]   costs, but to think about what the costs are and what the benefits are.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.600]   I think we've been relatively responsible in the sense that, you know, the big
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.280]   acceleration that happened late last year and beginning of this year, like we didn't
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.160]   cause that, we weren't the ones who did that.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.360]   And honestly, I think if you look at the reaction to Google, that might be 10
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.040]   times more important than anything else.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   And then once it had happened, once the ecosystem had changed, then we did a lot
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.920]   of things to stay on the frontier.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.760]   And so, I don't know, it's like any other question, right?
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.400]   You're trying to do the things that have the lowest costs and the biggest benefits
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.040]   that causes you to have different strategies at different times.
