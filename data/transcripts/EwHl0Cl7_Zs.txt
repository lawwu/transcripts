[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   Happy Friday everyone.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640]   This is a special episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.880]   and it comes to you in partnership
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.260]   with the Gospel Coalition.
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.240]   Today our guest, Dr. Don Carson joins us.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.520]   He is the co-founder and president of the Gospel Coalition.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.520]   He is also the editor of the new NIV Zondervan Study Bible
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.560]   which focuses on biblical theology themes
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.860]   as they develop in the Bible from Genesis
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.060]   to Revelation and nobody does this any better than Carson.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.200]   So we're launching a little occasional series
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.480]   of longer episodes.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.080]   We're all called Dr. Carson and he will riff
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.340]   on a certain theme in biblical theology.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.200]   In the future we'll cover topics like
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.560]   the doctrine of creation or the doctrine of kingship
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.120]   or atonement or kingdom and so on and so on.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.680]   Episodes will release on Fridays every three weeks or so
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.360]   on the podcast and should be wonderful.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.000]   Let's see if he's home first.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.200]   (phone ringing)
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.040]   Don Carson.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.280]   Dr. Carson, Tony Reinke at Desiring God Hello
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.160]   and thank you for joining us to record a little series
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.600]   of episodes on various prominent themes in the Bible.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.820]   Today we jump in and start with a historical overview
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.180]   of the Bible, the whole Bible.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.800]   Tell us the story of the Bible in one shot.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.640]   Are you ready?
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.460]   Yes.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.300]   Of course you are.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.340]   All right, take it away.
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.920]   Okay, here we go.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.120]   To talk about the overview of the Bible
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.960]   is to conjure up two rather distinct things.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.040]   On the one hand there's the Bible as we have it
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.120]   with Old Testament and New Testament
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.880]   and its division into various categories.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   And those categories are themselves sometimes
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   a bit different in English than in the study
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.500]   of the Hebrew Old Testament, for example.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.720]   We speak of the major and minor prophets,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.160]   but those are not the categories in which
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.040]   the students of the Hebrew Bible think.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.160]   But nevertheless we can break things down usefully
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.680]   into the Pentateuch, the first five books
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.320]   of the Old Testament, and historical books,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.080]   and wisdom literature, books like Proverbs
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.560]   and Ecclesiastes and so forth,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.520]   and prophets, major and minor,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.500]   even though those are not standard categories.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.460]   And in the New Testament one can think of Gospels,
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.300]   the Book of Acts, all the letters, the Apocalypse,
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.940]   and even the letters can be broken down
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.880]   into letters to churches versus letters to individuals
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.440]   like the first and second Timothy, Titus, Philemon.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.740]   All of these are useful categories.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.380]   What they don't get across is the sequence
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.180]   in which things are written,
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.320]   and they don't get across the chronology
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.380]   of the Bible storyline.
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.380]   And that's what we're interested in in this brief podcast.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.720]   That is to say, what's the Bible storyline
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.100]   that links these various books
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.520]   with their different literary forms
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.360]   and different structures and different languages
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.080]   and so on together?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.400]   The next thing to observe is that you can lay out
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.360]   that storyline in very brief sentences,
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.120]   or you could tease it out
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   to make it a mini Howard presentation.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.280]   In briefest form, you have creation,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.780]   fall, redemption, consummation.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.280]   That is the beginning and the end,
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.880]   and in between the two, you have the fall,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.120]   the problem that is addressed,
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.520]   and then redemption, the solution that God provides.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.240]   So that's laying out the Bible storyline
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.480]   in very, very brief compass.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.520]   Then one can fill it out just a wee bit
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.960]   so that one could summarize it in two minutes
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.120]   or three minutes, or one could lay out the details
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.040]   in many, many hours of discussion with charts
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.500]   and tie-ins to all the biblical books
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.160]   so that you see exactly where they fit in
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.200]   in the storyline and so on.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.880]   Moreover, some books are reflective
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.560]   of a particular incident or a particular time
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.080]   or a particular kingly reign, a particular period.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.680]   One thinks of the book of Esther, for example.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   It's tied to the time of one queen
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.660]   and one emperor and only part of their lives,
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.600]   whereas books like 1 and 2 Samuel
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.040]   and then 1 and 2 Kings or 1 and 2 Chronicles and so on,
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.260]   they cover multi-reigns,
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.520]   which means they've been brought together
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.640]   at the end of that period of reigns,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.880]   but it covers literally hundreds of years.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.160]   When you go from 1 Samuel to the end of 2 Kings,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   you're covering the period from before King Saul.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.180]   So you're back in the 11th century BC,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.400]   all the way to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586, 587.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.280]   It's almost half a millennium.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.120]   And that means that documents have been put together
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   and so forth, but the storyline is built out
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.760]   of the bits and pieces that you find there.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.000]   And then part of trying to understand the storyline
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.180]   is the fact that the last bit of narrative material
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.620]   in the Old Testament, the book of Nehemiah,
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.040]   still presents what's taking place
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.480]   about 400 years before Christ comes.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.120]   So to fill in the whole historical storyline
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.160]   brings you into filling out bits and pieces
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.320]   of what is often called the intertestamental period.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.040]   That is the period between the testaments,
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.400]   hence intertestamental period,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.560]   or it's sometimes called
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.720]   the period of Second Temple Judaism.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.880]   That is the period during which the Second Temple,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.240]   not the temple built by Solomon,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.740]   but the rebuilt temple after the return from the exile,
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.600]   during the period that it was standing,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.000]   all the way until the time it was destroyed in about AD 70,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.560]   which then overlaps, of course,
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.080]   with the onset of the Christian era.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.080]   So one could flush things out along those lines.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.320]   What I propose to do for the next few minutes
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.720]   is to take an in-between step,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.760]   to fill out the Bible storyline
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.220]   and indicate some of the ways
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.560]   the biblical books get locked in.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.780]   Because the more of that storyline you know,
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.780]   that you've memorized, that you've understood,
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.700]   then the easier it is to tie in particular books
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.160]   to that storyline and see where they fit.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.480]   So we begin with creation.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.040]   God makes everything good.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.320]   We'll have a separate session on just creation
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.520]   and how it functions in scripture.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.280]   And then comes the fall, rebellion against the creator,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.560]   and with it death and decay and destruction.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.060]   Eventually that leads to judgment.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.400]   The sin is so severe and God is so righteously angry
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   that he sends the flood.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.360]   That's Genesis 6-9, roughly.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.560]   But God in his mercy allows Noah and his family
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.040]   to escape, eight people.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   And then sadly, evil is still no better.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.240]   It breaks out again and results in the Tower of Babel
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.000]   as a sign of rebellion against God.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.440]   That's Genesis 11.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.140]   So Genesis 1-11 are sometimes referred
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.120]   to the prehistoric chapters,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.600]   which is not meant that they take place before history,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.360]   but before history writing.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.400]   We have a kind of demonstration of materials
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.960]   being recorded from Abraham on about 2000 BC.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.040]   And it's quite possible that some documents
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.900]   came down from earlier times,
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.880]   but we don't have access to them.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.840]   So from Genesis 12-50,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.200]   that is the rest of the book of Genesis,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.040]   you have what's sometimes called the patriarchal cycles.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.840]   You have Abraham and then Isaac,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.720]   then Jacob, then his sons, especially Joseph.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.160]   And what you have then is the rise
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.560]   of the Jewish people as a race.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   There's still no experience of nationhood at this point.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.340]   There's still a large extended family.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.520]   And here there's a huge emphasis on the promises of God,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.320]   the covenant of God with Abraham.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.240]   One can argue that God made a covenant
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.740]   with Adam in the garden,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.260]   but we'll come to that briefly
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.080]   when we consider creation more closely.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.920]   So here you have the Abrahamic covenant,
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.720]   which is picked up in the New Testament.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.120]   We'll return to that.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.460]   And by the time you come to the end of the book of Genesis,
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.680]   then the people of God, the Israelites,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.880]   are about 70 strong plus some further children
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.040]   as they're born in Egypt,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.480]   down in Egypt with one of the brothers, Joseph,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.080]   being, let's call him a prime minister.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.920]   And that sets the stage for what takes place
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.920]   hundreds of years later with an emperor who rises
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.820]   and an Egyptian pharaoh who rises,
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.880]   who has no personal knowledge
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.920]   or even particular recollection of Joseph.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.560]   Too much time has passed.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.240]   The Israelites have multiplied.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.520]   They're viewed as a threat.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   And so gradually imposed servitude is demanded.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.540]   And eventually that leads to outright slavery.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.200]   And that sets the stage for the second book of the Pentateuch.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.620]   That is the book of the Exodus.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.520]   And here, the first half of the book
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.840]   is really the account of the birth of Moses
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.720]   and then his becoming a young, trained man
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.960]   in the courts of Pharaoh, brought up by Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.160]   but still racially feeling loyal to fellow Israelites
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.400]   and loyal to God.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.320]   He behaves foolishly as a young man
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.640]   and finds himself fleeing for his life
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.800]   into the backside of the Midianite desert
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.360]   where he's a shepherd until about the age of 80.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.800]   And then God calls him.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.200]   And through what we call the 10 plagues
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.160]   and God's repeated self-disclosure to the people
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   in miracles and in word and so on,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.000]   eventually God leads the people of Israel out
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.280]   across the Red Sea under the leadership of Moses.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.160]   That leads people down then to Sinai
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.920]   and the giving of the law.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.520]   And the high point of that is the 10 commandments
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   in Exodus chapter 20.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.080]   And immediately after Exodus chapter 20,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.840]   you have the stipulations that come
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.640]   with the giving of the 10 commandments.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.560]   Some parts of holiness and the building of the temple,
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.000]   of the tabernacle, rather, the stipulations and so on
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.400]   for the priesthood and all kinds of interesting
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.160]   little tidbits, what an ephod is
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.240]   that the priest uses and so forth.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.000]   And that goes on until you have the account
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.720]   of Moses coming down from the mountain
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   where he has met with God, Exodus 32, 33, 34,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.200]   and finds the people already in an act
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.080]   of craven idolatry, acting as if a calf
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.760]   that they make of pieces of gold represent Yahweh
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   and debauched forms of religion,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.520]   judgment falls and so forth.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.880]   And that brings you ultimately to the sad reality
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.360]   that the people of that generation don't get
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.000]   into the promised land, the land of Canaan,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.160]   because when they approach that land at Kadesh Barnea,
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   then most of the spies who go and seek out the land
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.360]   come back just afraid to go any further,
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.960]   even though they've seen God do such wonderful things
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.920]   for them in the preceding release.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.480]   And so that generation from 20 and up dies off
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.800]   through 40 years of wilderness wandering.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.880]   And Moses himself doesn't get into the promised land
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.560]   because of some acts of bad temper and want of faith.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.440]   So he dies at the end of the Pentateuch himself,
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.800]   he doesn't get into the promised land.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   Then Exodus is followed by Leviticus with a lot of laws,
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.400]   many of them ceremonial, some of them highly memorable
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.920]   moral laws like you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.000]   But now you're introduced to the heart
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.680]   of the priestly sacrificial ritual system
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.560]   with lots of emphasis on the Day of Atonement,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.400]   especially in Leviticus 16 and Passover laws
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.200]   and holiness code and so forth.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.960]   Numbers lays out the numbering of the people
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.840]   and what will be distribution of land
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.120]   once they get into the promised land.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.960]   Deuteronomy is a kind of review,
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.640]   Moses calling everybody back to faithfulness
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   as they get ready to enter the promised land
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.600]   after all kinds of little historical vignettes
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.920]   of what has taken place in the 40 year gap.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.680]   And then Moses himself dies in the last book of Deuteronomy
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.880]   and is buried by God himself at a place
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.720]   that nobody knows about on Mount Nebo.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.600]   So that's the Pentateuch.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.800]   And in one sense, you see, it ends with a discouragement.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.720]   God promises blessings and cursings,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.560]   the blessings upon those who obey
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.120]   and curses upon those who disobey
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.640]   and guess which way it's going to go.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.320]   It's indicated even by the fact that Moses himself
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.880]   called the meekest man who ever lived
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.640]   doesn't get into the promised land.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.000]   And so the promises of grace
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.520]   that are scattered through the book
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.520]   have to be taken seriously to speak as many do
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.280]   of a kind of Deuteronomic theology
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.680]   as if it's all merit, blessing and curses,
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.840]   depending on how you do is too reductionistic
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.160]   because those blessings and curses issue in constant picture
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.040]   where in fact, the curses come to the fore
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.240]   and people fail again and again and again,
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.120]   driving you to grace.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.520]   Then Joshua and Judges,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.480]   Joshua brings the people into the promised land,
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.280]   but Judges shows that in the following years,
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.080]   there are cycles of depravity
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.600]   that bring the people down again and again and again.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.480]   When the people get desperate enough,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.000]   crushed by local peoples,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.720]   then God raises up a judge
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.560]   and the people are spared again.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.000]   And a couple of generations later,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.400]   they've slunk into the same sort of idolatry and immorality.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   Until the book ends again with bleakest despair,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.840]   in those days, there was no king in Israel.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.880]   Everyone did that, which is right in their own eyes.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.840]   And so you begin to say, what we really need is a king,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.240]   a king who is just and right and true.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.840]   And so during that period of the Judges,
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.320]   you also get this, the story of Ruth, for example,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.760]   and other little snippets.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.160]   Then what you have in one and two Samuel,
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.120]   one and two Kings,
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.040]   and then reviewed again in one and two Chronicles
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.720]   is the movement from the period of the Judges,
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.840]   the last great one being Samuel,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.560]   to the onset of kingship.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.320]   And the first king of what's called the United Monarchy,
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.880]   all the tribes together is King Saul.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.600]   And he starts off well,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.400]   but the people want him for the wrong reasons.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.680]   They want to be like the pagans around.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   And Saul himself is, despite his height and his gallantry
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.680]   and his initial meekness,
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.000]   he's insecure and lashes out
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.240]   and is angry at anybody that threatens his position.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.280]   Eventually he becomes a barbaric in his cruelty
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.640]   and his insecurity and his rebellion against God.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.360]   So he wants to take on both priestly and kingly functions.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.520]   And the result is he is killed and so is his son.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.200]   There's never a Saul dynasty.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.520]   And God appoints as king,
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.440]   a man after his own heart, we're called,
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.400]   which is the beginning of the Davidic dynasty.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   And that is highlighted in 2 Kings chapter seven.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.560]   In fact, two Kings six and seven need to be read together
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.080]   because when David first becomes king,
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.320]   he's king of only two tribes in the South
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.760]   and the Northern 10 tribes remain
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.400]   under independent governance.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.200]   And his capital is in Hebron.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.480]   But after seven years, he takes Jerusalem
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   and becomes king of the entire 12 tribes
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.800]   and then reigns for 33 more years in Jerusalem.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.520]   So in 2 Kings chapters six and seven,
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.760]   what you find is the confluence of several themes.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.360]   You have now the rise of Jerusalem as the capital city.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.440]   And that sets an entire trajectory
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.160]   that finally ends in the new Jerusalem.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.440]   This is the city of the great king, the Davidic dynasty.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's the city now also of what will become the temple.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.120]   The tabernacle has moved into Jerusalem
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.880]   and it is never moved out
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.320]   instead of being in Shiloh or some other place
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.440]   moved around a bit within the tribes.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.320]   Now, Jerusalem, what will be the temple
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.040]   and the Davidic kingship are all in one place.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.960]   That sets trajectories that run right
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.280]   through the rest of the Old Testament
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.360]   and find various forms of fulfillment in Jesus.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.880]   So chapter six of 2 Samuel
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.240]   is the movement of the tabernacle to Jerusalem.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.600]   Chapter seven is the establishment
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   of the Jerusalem Davidic kingship, a moving thing.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.520]   And the promise, the groundwork
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.480]   for collecting the materials and the money
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.840]   needed to build the Jerusalem temple,
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.040]   which is undertaken eventually by Solomon.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.240]   And the next generation.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.160]   So some of these materials are celebrated in Psalms
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.320]   and in other ways too.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.200]   Psalm two is a reflection of the establishment
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.360]   of the Davidic dynasty looking forward
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   to a faithful, powerful Davidic king.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:18.040]   So we can track out more of those bits and pieces,
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.320]   how the Davidic kingship develops in other podcasts.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.920]   But right now we need to focus on the storyline itself.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.760]   So Solomon then follows David.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.760]   And when he dies, his son Rehoboam wants to act powerful
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.860]   but succeeds only in dividing the kingdom
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.760]   between the Northern tribes, Israel,
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.160]   and the Southern tribes based in Jerusalem.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.480]   So Rehoboam now is king in Jerusalem,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.720]   but of only two tribes, that's all.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   And the Northern tribes develop their own king dominion.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.000]   First of all, under Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.440]   And he picks up the tag, Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   who taught Israel to sin.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.920]   And in order to prevent these people
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.200]   from going regularly to the temple in Jerusalem,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.920]   and thus maybe having a divided political allegiance,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.480]   he establishes two temples, one way up North in Dan,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.440]   and one in the area that is eventually called Samaria,
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.400]   just North of Jerusalem, but in the 10 tribes.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   And so there is idolatry and more and more
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:42.200]   multiplication of gods as the people
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   maintain some kind of loose allegiance to Yahweh, to God,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.740]   even while multiplying gods on every side.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.160]   And in the North, the accounts that are told
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.600]   in one and two kings, and in one and two chronicles
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.120]   and so on, are really pathetic.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.260]   Each dynasty lasts only one, two, three generations
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.660]   and then bumped off by somebody,
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.880]   and there's a murderous rage,
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.920]   and all their kids are killed because there's a fear
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.640]   that somebody from the old dynasty
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.600]   will take over again and so forth.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.080]   And eventually, under the press of horrible idolatry,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.880]   God sends in the Assyrian army,
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.680]   and the Assyrians capture the leadership
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.080]   and transport it off to the ends of the earth
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.880]   to Assyria in the far North, about 721 BC.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.520]   Jerusalem, though it's attacked, is spared.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.160]   And eventually, by the time Jerusalem's sins
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.040]   have been multiplied and multiplied,
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.640]   then by that time, the regional superpower
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.440]   is no longer Assyria, it's Babylon,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.200]   which has taken over from Assyria.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.320]   So Jerusalem is sacked in 586 BC,
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.600]   and the temple is destroyed, and under Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.900]   their leaders are transported in three successive waves,
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.320]   culminating in 586 BC.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.920]   Now, it's within that framework
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.320]   that it is helpful to read the opening lines of the prophets
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.920]   so that you start reading Isaiah, for example,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.400]   and the opening verses tell you
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.240]   that what takes place in Isaiah's prophetic ministry
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.040]   is under the reigns of so-and-so and so-and-so
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.200]   and so-and-so.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   And Isaiah himself lives during the time
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.160]   of the Assyrian power, but prophetically,
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.840]   he looks forward to what's going to take place
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.000]   under the Babylonian reign as well,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.160]   so that his vision covers something like 150 years
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.960]   of what will take place.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.960]   And he foresees not only the destruction of Jerusalem,
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   but he foresees also, eventually,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.760]   not only the exile, but the return from the exile
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.080]   when God will bring salvation to his people,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.200]   and in the far, far, far distance,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.320]   like the distant mountains peeping
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.640]   over the near mountains, he foresees, ultimately,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   a new heaven and a new earth
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.340]   that's going to change the rules of the game entirely.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.160]   So in prophetic words, then,
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   now Isaiah envisages a time when a Davidic son is born.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.800]   A son is born, a child is born.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.280]   He will reign on the throne of his father, David.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.580]   Of the increase of his kingdom, there will be no end.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.560]   There's a promise of the Davidic dynasty.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.880]   Yet at the same time, he will be called
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.560]   a wonderful counselor, the mighty God,
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.040]   the everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.960]   We need to track out that Davidic dynasty theme
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.480]   in the Old Testament.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.320]   Meanwhile, then, the people of God go into exile,
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   and around the years before the Jerusalem people
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.040]   are carted off to the Babylonian empire,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.660]   Jeremiah is preaching in Jerusalem,
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.760]   and Ezekiel is preaching in Babylon,
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.040]   carted off by an earlier wave.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.160]   And they're both saying the same thing.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.320]   They're both saying the people
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.960]   must not rebel against Babylon.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.080]   If they do, they're going to be destroyed.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.100]   But they rebel against God, and they are destroyed.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:17.100]   And the huge messages of Jeremiah and of Ezekiel
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.380]   are that the people are so wicked
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.800]   that destruction and exile are inevitable,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.480]   and the only hope at the end of the period of exile
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.440]   is that God himself brings them back
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.240]   and provides a redeemer for them.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.920]   So when the people start returning,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.640]   then you have the ministry
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.720]   of the so-called post-exilic prophets,
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.060]   people like Haggai, who preaches to tell the people
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.160]   who are returning that they really need
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.600]   to build the temple right away.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.820]   That's the center of the meeting place
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.320]   between God and human beings that God himself has ordained.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   And so a small temple is rebuilt in Jerusalem.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   And here's when you find also the ministry of Ezra,
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.160]   and then a little later, the ministry of Nehemiah,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.640]   who is brought back by God himself
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.000]   to build the wall around the city.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.980]   The temple is built before Jerusalem is rebuilt.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.320]   Hardly anybody lives there.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.860]   They're poor, dirt poor, living in farms around the area.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.920]   But the temple is there and is operating
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.520]   in a low-key, unfaithful, miserable sort of way
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.560]   until Nehemiah, strengthened by God,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.560]   rebuilds the city wall despite a lot of opposition
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.480]   and invests in a repopulation program
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.460]   to get people inside and build up the city again.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.580]   And that's when you find the final storyline
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.360]   of the Old Testament under the ministry of Nehemiah.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.940]   So you have a number of post-exilic prophets
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.480]   writing and preaching at that time.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.960]   That is prophets preaching to the people of God
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.720]   after, post the exile.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.440]   So you have the pre-exilic prophets
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.040]   like Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Isaiah,
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.160]   and the post-exilic prophets.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.200]   Right at the turn of the period is Daniel himself,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   and then post-exile people like Haggai and Zechariah
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.860]   and Malachi.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.640]   And then what happens in the period between the Testaments
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.880]   is hundreds of years when the people are really
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.040]   under one regional superpower or another.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.120]   After the Assyrians, as we've said, come the Babylonians.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.400]   After the Babylonians come the Persians.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.000]   And it's under the Persian Empire
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.600]   that the Jews are allowed back into the Promised Land.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.920]   There was a reversal of imperial policy
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.080]   and a lot of people who had been transported
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.000]   are allowed back into their own lands,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.560]   including the Moabites, for example.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.240]   It wasn't just the Jews.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.120]   And God faithfully thus brings his people back to the land.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.800]   But the Persians are eventually taken over by the Greeks.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.320]   And then the Greek Empire dies when Alexander the Great dies
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.680]   in the last third of the fourth century BC.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.640]   And his land is broken up into four regions
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.760]   led by four former generals.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.020]   None of this is found as history in the Old Testament,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.720]   but some of it is predicted by the visions of Daniel.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.100]   And eventually Israel finds itself squashed
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.400]   between a general in the south in the land of Egypt
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.200]   and a general to the north in the land of Syria.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.400]   And they're caught in no man's land in endless struggles.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.280]   And eventually a wicked general in the north
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.560]   in the second century BC,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.880]   a man called Antiochus IV Epiphanes,
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.720]   he decides to impose imperial paganism on Jerusalem.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   He makes sacrifice in the temple to Yahweh, to God,
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.940]   a capital crime.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.500]   Owning any part of Torah is a capital crime.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.020]   Observing the Sabbath is a capital crime.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.300]   And he intends by terror to impose paganism on the people.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.340]   And what happens is he kicks off a bloody civil war
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:11.540]   that is characterized by endless guerrilla struggles.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.300]   People can read about that for themselves
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.500]   in the writings of Josephus,
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.940]   a first century AD historian.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.940]   And the bloodiest part of that takes place 167 to 164 BC.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.100]   And eventually the Jews become strong enough
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.540]   that there's a set piece of battle by the Orontes River
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.420]   and the Assyrians are beaten,
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.340]   the Assyrians rather, not the Assyrians,
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.820]   the Assyrians under Antiochus IV Epiphanes are beaten.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.260]   And for the first time in half a millennium,
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.260]   the Jews have a right to reestablish the Davidic kingship.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.420]   But is that what they do?
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.740]   Nope, rather the guerrilla leaders themselves take over.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.700]   And so when they have a right
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.900]   to reestablish the Davidic kingship, they don't do so.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.300]   And a century later in 63 BC, the Romans take over.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.220]   And so the people are under the oppression of Rome now,
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   the Roman Empire.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.380]   And that's the way it is
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.260]   with a regional local puppet called Herod,
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.840]   who is operating under the aegis of the Roman Empire
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.520]   when Jesus is born in Bethlehem of Judea
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.800]   in fulfillment of the prophecy of Micah.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.760]   So Jesus is born then under Roman imperial rule
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.760]   and lives, serves, dies, rises again.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.560]   And the exact date of his resurrection,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.040]   some think it's about AD 30, some about AD 33,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.720]   but certainly in that period.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   And then the church explodes in numbers,
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.720]   first of all in Jewish circles, then in Gentile circles,
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.320]   until you have the ministry of Paul and others
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.200]   with the church expanding throughout the Roman world.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.880]   And much of the book of Acts
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.720]   traces the spreading of the gospel
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.920]   through the ministries of Peter and Paul and a few others
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.480]   until the gospel actually is well-established in Rome itself.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.240]   And thus, although not politically threatening
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.440]   the Roman Empire at this stage,
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.200]   nevertheless demonstrating that as Jesus puts it
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.440]   at the end of Matthew,
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.240]   all authority is given to him in heaven and on earth
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.920]   in the wake of his death, burial, resurrection,
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.360]   and ascension.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.860]   The rest of the New Testament fills out the interactions
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.360]   between New Testament writers
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.120]   and local or regional groups of Christians in churches
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.080]   or regions to address theological and pastoral issues
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.120]   until you get to the last book of the New Testament,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.680]   the Apocalypse.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.600]   Here, Christians have divided over the years
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.260]   about how to interpret that book.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:48.280]   It's worth sometimes spending time to outline
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.720]   how Christians have understood the future
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.000]   at different periods of the church's history.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.320]   They have tended to one position or another.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.880]   At the, in the first half of the 20th century,
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.360]   a vast number of Christians in America
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.580]   called themselves pre-millennial, pre-tribulationists.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:11.040]   But one must remember that in the period of the Puritans,
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.340]   for example, the overwhelming majority
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.800]   were post-millennialists and a few pre-millennialists.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.500]   There were no all-millennialists.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.560]   At the moment, all-millennialism is on the rise.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.080]   If you don't know what those terms are,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.920]   don't worry about it.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.560]   Because my point in this survey is that
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.200]   all of these groups, without exception,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.520]   do understand that the ultimate hope of the church
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.240]   is not some sort of millennial splendor.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.760]   The ultimate hope of the church
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.600]   is the new heaven and the new earth,
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.600]   resurrection existence in a remade, reconstituted universe
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.840]   that includes resurrection existence,
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.640]   where there's no more death, there's no more sorrow,
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.280]   there are no more tears or pain or suffering.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.480]   The old order, Revelation 21, is passed away.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.580]   It can be seen as a new Jerusalem.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.760]   It can be seen as a bride finally consummated
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.800]   in union with Christ.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.080]   It can be seen as a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.240]   but spectacular, holy resurrection existence
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.800]   with the glory of glories being
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.880]   that they shall see God face to face
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.760]   in a way that even the angels of heaven can't see God.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.200]   The angels cover their faces with their wings
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.300]   and cry, "Holy, holy, holy."
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.040]   But according to Revelation 22,
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.840]   God's redeemed people actually gaze on God.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.760]   And in vast, picturesque descriptions
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.660]   of what this existence will look like,
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.200]   we are treated to visions of work and of song
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.080]   and of praise and of righteous living and God-centeredness
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   and glory to him who sits on the throne
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.440]   and to the Lamb forever and ever.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.040]   - Oh my, that is an incredibly rich history
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.920]   of the Bible storyline.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.520]   Thank you, Dr. Carson.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.800]   So many themes have been mentioned here in this episode
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.760]   and we'll begin to pick them up now one by one.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.000]   And next time, we'll focus on the doctrine of creation.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.400]   And that'll be in a few weeks.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.760]   We'll give you a call again.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.840]   Thank you, Dr. Carson.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.440]   - Okay, blessings, bye now.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.680]   - That was Dr. Don Carson, the co-founder
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.040]   and president of the Gospel Coalition.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.480]   He is the editor of the new NIV Zondervan Study Bible.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.300]   And next time, Dr. Carson will give us
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.680]   a biblical theology of creation as it runs
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.800]   throughout the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.500]   This has been a special episode
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.880]   in the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.960]   a longer weekend episode, and it's been made possible
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.520]   by our partnership with the Gospel Coalition.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.440]   We appreciate our friends over there.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.960]   We return on Monday with John Piper
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.640]   to look at how Christians should tolerate
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.860]   the religious beliefs of non-Christians.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.800]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.040]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.200]   (silence)
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.360]   (silence)
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.520]   (silence)
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:05.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
