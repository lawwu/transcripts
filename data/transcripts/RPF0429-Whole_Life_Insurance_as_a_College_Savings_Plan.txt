[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Hey radicals, welcome to the show.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   This is Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.320]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.760]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.360]   Broadcasting to you today from a very rainy afternoon here in West Palm Beach, Florida
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.240]   at the Radical Personal Finance HQ.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.840]   And the question of the day comes in from Alan.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.360]   Alan writes in and says, "Joshua, what are your thoughts on using whole life insurance
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.360]   as a college savings plan?
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.900]   If you don't like it, why?
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.160]   If you have an episode about this already, let me know which episode number."
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.200]   Alan, thanks for writing in with the question.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.620]   I do not have a separate standalone episode on the topic of using whole life insurance
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.880]   to save for college.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.440]   But I do have some thoughts on the subject.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.080]   Now, quick preamble on the topic of whole life insurance.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.880]   I am not a partisan on this issue.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.880]   I'm not an extremist.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.840]   I don't go for the perspective that you should never own or purchase whole life insurance,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.640]   nor do I go from the perspective that whole life insurance is the latest, greatest thing
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.400]   and you should put all of your money from your checking account, savings account, and
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.960]   withdraw every single investment into a life insurance plan.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.360]   I don't buy either of those scenarios myself.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.040]   I look at it in a little bit more of a balanced way and say that whole life insurance is a
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.440]   financial product.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.000]   It has certain fundamental attributes, certain fundamental unique characteristics, and those
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.960]   characteristics are what you weigh and consider to decide what and how you should use the
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.280]   product.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.640]   For any new listeners of Radical Personal Finance, I do not hold a life insurance license.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.920]   I used to have life insurance licenses.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.840]   I used to be a licensed financial advisor, but I am not licensed to sell life insurance.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   I do not have any financial relationships with insurance companies.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.320]   So my financial conflicts of interest in this area are nonexistent.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.980]   I own whole life insurance policies on me.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.640]   My wife has a whole life insurance policy and I own a whole life insurance policy on
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.720]   each of my children.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.100]   However, I do not, would not, and don't recommend the use of a whole life insurance policy as
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.920]   a college funding plan.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.620]   Long time listeners of the show will know that in general I'm opposed to the extreme
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.720]   prioritization of college saving.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.720]   If you have not yet heard it, you should listen to episode 276 of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.580]   which is titled "Why This Financial Planner Refuses to Save Money for His Kid's College."
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.180]   This financial planner refers to me, Joshua Sheets, and I refuse to save money for my
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.000]   children's college.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.500]   That's not because I'm an irresponsible parent, but because I believe that this is a really
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.900]   silly thing to do with money when there are many other opportunities and alternatives.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.820]   For the sake of this conversation, obviously, I'm going to skip past that opinion and answer
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.140]   your question directly, assuming that you are desiring to save money for your child's
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.060]   college.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.340]   Whole life insurance should not be the first thing that you consider to save for whole
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.340]   life insurance.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.380]   Also, check the Radical Personal Finance archives.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.300]   I've done extensive shows on 529 plans.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.020]   I've done extensive shows on the Coverdell Educational Savings Account.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.080]   Both of those are superior mechanisms for you to save for your child's education.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.800]   The Coverdell Educational Savings Account and the 529 plans have better tax advantages
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.560]   for you with regard to then life insurance.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.860]   You can accumulate the money in those accounts, and as long as you use it for college, you
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.980]   can distribute the money out of them completely tax-free without ever paying tax on the gain.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.680]   That is superior to life insurance.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.220]   In addition, you can invest in assets that have a higher potential for growth, whether
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.980]   that means choosing a selection of stocks and equities, which if you have a long enough
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.340]   time horizon, will hopefully appreciate at a higher rate than a life insurance policy
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.340]   will.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.380]   Most life insurance policies, whole life insurance policies, are going to be based upon the life
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.500]   insurance company's general portfolio, their general account, and the majority of that
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.900]   portfolio is going to be invested in fixed income, very stable and secure assets.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.340]   So in general, if you own stocks in a 529 plan and if the stock market appreciated in
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:55.820]   a healthy manner, you would usually wind up with more money in that type of account than
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.700]   you would in a life insurance policy.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.020]   If you have other potential opportunities for investments, let's say that you invest
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:14.220]   in some unique approach, you buy tax liens or a local real estate investor, etc., you
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.780]   should look into using a self-directed Coverdell educational savings account.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.220]   If you accumulate money in a self-directed Coverdell educational savings account, you
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.940]   could possibly be able to control your own investments and use the money there from a
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.260]   Coverdell either to cover primary school expenses or to cover college expenses as well.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.460]   So all of those are better options.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.540]   But of course, for the sake of this podcast, we want to talk about life insurance as a
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.020]   college funding mechanism and talk about what's great about it and what's not great about
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   it.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.100]   I said a moment ago that I don't generally recommend and I don't recommend that you start
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.500]   with using a life insurance policy for college savings.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.580]   But I also see many ways that you can use it for college.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.820]   Let me give you a couple of ideas.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.540]   First, the way that most people think about approaching this I don't think works.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.500]   The way that most people think about this is, "Hey, I've got a new child, a young boy,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   young girl.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:19.100]   I want to buy a life insurance policy on their life so they are the insured, the parent would
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.740]   be the owner of the contract.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.180]   I'm going to buy this policy on the life of my son or daughter.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.080]   This policy will accumulate cash values within it and those cash values will be available
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.780]   at the age of 18 to pay for college expenses."
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.100]   I don't think that plan works.
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.580]   In the years that I worked as an insurance agent selling life insurance, I had many people
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.900]   ask me about this and I worked and worked and worked on different plans to try to see
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.100]   if there was any way that I could get the policy to work for that purpose.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.260]   I just couldn't make it happen.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.420]   The reasons are primarily due to the limitations of using a life insurance contract as this
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.820]   vehicle.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.580]   The first problem with using a life insurance contract as this vehicle is its life insurance.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:15.700]   When you're using a cash value policy, a whole life policy, you have to pay for an insurance
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.020]   contract that's going to be enforced for a very long time.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.420]   You have to pay for the death benefit.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.820]   With children, it seems like the ratio of expenses is very high.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.820]   Usually you're buying generally pretty small policies.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.620]   You can't buy a $5 million insurance policy on your child unless you have a $50 million
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.660]   policy on you and that's just not the world that most of us are living in.
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.580]   It always seems like the ratio of the cost of insurance is very, very high on those policies.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.220]   Not actuarially, just simply in the short term.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:58.340]   The big problem with life insurance contracts when they're measured on the spectrum of is
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.740]   this a good use of money as for an investment, for cash accumulation, is all the expenses
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.700]   come out up front.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.620]   In general, whole life insurance policies accumulate cash very slowly in the beginning
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.620]   years.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.380]   The reasons for that are numerous.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:20.420]   First, there is a heavy expense in the first year of a life insurance contract to pay the
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.420]   commission to the life insurance agent who sells the policy.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:30.620]   That commission rate is generally at least 50% and it can range to as high as 100% depending
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.820]   on the company and depending on the contract.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.060]   That's a heavy chunk of cost and all of that cost comes right out of the policy.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.540]   The company themselves are paying that commission to the agent.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.700]   Well, there's no free money.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.000]   The insurance company isn't printing money to pay the commission from some other account.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.140]   That's coming out of the policy.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.980]   You have a heavy commission up front in a whole life insurance contract.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.980]   You also have significant expenses that the insurance company charges to the contract
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.500]   in the beginning years.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.660]   Obviously, there's the big one which is mortality and expense.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.320]   The mortality and expense charge just simply reflects the cost of the insurance.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.020]   When you buy an insurance policy, the insurance company is on the hook from day one to take
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:28.540]   that money and to pay a death claim if you die or if the child dies in this case.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.820]   Given this commitment, they have to set aside a significant amount of money up front to
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.540]   start to accumulate to pay that death benefit.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.300]   They pull out those mortality and expense charges in the beginning.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.580]   Now, of course, there are other expenses.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.900]   These are not necessarily directly reflected in the policy, but there are underwriting
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.900]   expenses.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.660]   There are medical expenses and the insurance company has to pay for those in the early
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.820]   years as well.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:01.020]   Whole life insurance policies in the first year generally accumulate almost no cash value.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:07.140]   The purchase of a whole life insurance policy is one of the worst things that you can do
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.580]   if you keep the policy for a very short time.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.420]   It will be extremely expensive.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.660]   You never purchase a policy that you're only planning to keep for a short time.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:26.220]   The only place that whole life insurance will be useful to you is for the accumulation of
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.940]   money that's going to be for a very long time.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:37.500]   The minimum amount of time is probably at least 15 to 20 years.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.420]   That's the fundamental problem with using life insurance contracts for saving for a
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.820]   child's college.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.700]   When you actually run the numbers, run the proposals, you're going to have heavy expenses
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:59.460]   in the early years and it takes them a long time to build up and accumulate cash.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.620]   There are some policies.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.900]   I've talked to college planning experts, some of whom are also life insurance agents,
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:12.160]   and they use specially designed policies that are partly designed for this purpose.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.220]   I've never been convinced.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.260]   I've never seen the proposal.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.180]   If any of you work in that business, I would ask you to send me some proposals.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.980]   Run them for some sample children and let me look at the numbers.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.940]   Let me look at the ledgers and understand.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.260]   I've never in my career found one that worked, that I looked at it and said it was a good
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.260]   use of the dollar.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:36.540]   I never sold a client a whole life insurance policy on his or her child with the goal of
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.820]   using that policy to pay for college.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.900]   One final point on why and then we'll move on to how you can use life insurance to pay
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.660]   for college.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.340]   The other major thing to recognize is why are you doing all this?
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.060]   Why are you buying a cash value policy?
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.620]   You say, "Well, I'm buying it for the investment component."
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.620]   Okay.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:03.220]   If that's the case, you're going to be accumulating money in the contract in a very
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.340]   safe manner.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.580]   You basically own what's equivalent to a fixed income portfolio.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.820]   It's going to be very, very steady growth.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.740]   That's going to save some of the volatility.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.300]   But the other thing that people talk about is with regard to the tax benefits.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.780]   The problem with these contracts is they don't accumulate many gains and because they don't
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.620]   accumulate many gains, you don't actually save that much on taxes.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.860]   So the tax benefits are negligible.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:39.980]   Finally, what about the benefit of the – the much vaunted benefit that money that's accumulated
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.860]   as cash value in a life insurance policy is not reported on the FAFSA, the Free Application
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.600]   for Federal Student Aid?
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.400]   This is true.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.140]   The FAFSA doesn't consider cash value life insurance as an asset.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.500]   But this can be misleading for a couple of reasons.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:04.180]   Number one, that's not the only asset that is not considered on the FAFSA.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.900]   For example, what about money that's accumulated in a qualified retirement account?
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.020]   That can be done.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.780]   That money is not reported on a FAFSA.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:19.300]   Let me read to you directly from the FAFSA and show you how certain assets are treated
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.700]   and how certain assets are not treated.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:27.380]   So I'm reading here from the notes instructions from the FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.860]   Student Aid, from their instructions here.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.300]   These instructions would be – are the same notes where the student is reporting their
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.020]   income and their assets and also for the parent.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.940]   When the parent is listing – when the parent or student is listing the net worth, here
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.220]   are the definitions.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:54.300]   Net worth means the current value as of today of investments, businesses, and/or investment
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:02.020]   farms minus debts related to those same investments, businesses, and/or investment farms.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.940]   In calculating net worth, use zero for investments or properties with a negative value.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.620]   Investments include real estate.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.620]   Do not include the home in which you live.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.140]   Rental property includes a unit within a family home that has its own entrance, kitchen, and
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.500]   bath rented to someone other than a family member.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:29.220]   Trust funds, UGMA and UTMA accounts, money market funds, mutual funds, certificates of
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:38.260]   deposit, stocks, stock options, bonds, other securities, installment and land sale contracts
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.700]   including mortgages held, commodities, etc.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:50.180]   Investments also include qualified educational benefits or education savings accounts.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.660]   Example Coverdell savings accounts, 529 college savings plans, and the refund value of 529
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.820]   prepaid tuition plans.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.180]   For a student who does not report parental information, the accounts owned by the student
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.000]   and/or the student's spouse are reported as student investments in Question 42.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.860]   For students who must report parental information, the accounts are reported as parental investments
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.540]   in Question 91, including all accounts owned by the student and all accounts owned by the
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.980]   parents for any member of the household.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.140]   Money received or paid on your behalf also includes distributions to you, the student
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.700]   beneficiary, from a 529 plan that is owned by someone other than you or your parents,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.500]   such as your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and non-custodial parents.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.540]   You must include these distribution amounts in Question 45J.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.340]   Now let's get to the big ones here.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.620]   Investments do not include, so everything before was things that are included, investments
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:49.500]   do not include the home you live in, the value of life insurance, retirement plans, 401(k)
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:55.660]   plans, pension funds, annuities, non-education IRAs, Keogh plans, etc. or cash savings and
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.540]   checking accounts already reported in Questions 41 and 90.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.660]   Investments also do not include UGMA and UTMA accounts for which you are the custodian but
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.060]   not the owner.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.980]   Investment value means the current balance or market value of these investments as of
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.140]   today.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.740]   Investment debt means only those debts that are related to the investments.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.940]   Business and/or investment farm value includes the market value of land, buildings, machinery,
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.020]   equipment, inventory, etc.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:38.620]   Business value does not include the value of a small business if your family owns and
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:45.900]   controls more than 50% of the business and the business has 100 or fewer full-time or
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:52.300]   full-time equivalent employees.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:58.020]   Business value does not include the value of a small business if your family owns and
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:05.660]   controls more than 50% of the business and the business has 100 or fewer full-time or
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.100]   full-time equivalent employees.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.700]   For small business value, your family includes 1) persons directly related to you such as
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:18.360]   a parent, sister, or cousin and/or 2) persons who are or were related to you by marriage
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.280]   such as a spouse, step-parent, or sister-in-law.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:30.100]   Investment farm value does not include the value of a family farm that you, your spouse,
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.460]   and/or your parents live on and operate.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:39.820]   I read these things to you to demonstrate to you that often there are many ways that
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.980]   you can have assets that are not reported on the FAFSA.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:49.460]   So yes, life insurance is one of those assets and you should consider that when potentially
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.620]   owning a life insurance policy.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:58.700]   However, you can also do the same thing with say an IRA or Roth IRA.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.500]   You can do the same thing with a Roth IRA for you.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.900]   You can do the same thing with a Roth IRA for your child.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.100]   You can also pursue strategies such as paying off your mortgage before you, if you have
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.580]   a bunch of money sitting in investment accounts or in checking or savings accounts and you
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.600]   need to apply for the FAFSA, then consider wiping out your mortgage debt and putting
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.820]   all that money into home equity because the home equity in your principal residence will
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:32.980]   not be reported on the FAFSA or possibly owning your own business, small business.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.220]   So you need to read these, read documents for yourself is my point.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.180]   Hard to do, easy to say, hard to do, but it's important.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:46.900]   So in short, these are the reasons why I don't think it's a good plan to pursue the purchase
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:53.460]   of a life insurance policy for your children as a primary means of funding college.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.260]   I think there are better ways.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.500]   I think there are more efficient ways.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.620]   College funding accounts are superior.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:08.920]   I think that there are other ways with – again, IRA is even superior, Roth IRA, make distributions
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.360]   at college age to cover that.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.300]   So all of these ways are superior.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.780]   There are other things that you can do and when you actually look at a life insurance
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.900]   contract and see the problems with it, the costs are up front, the investment return
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.580]   is generally low over the short term like that, the tax savings are negligible because
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.980]   the investment return is so low and the life insurance policy breaks down.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.500]   That does not mean I don't recommend you consider purchasing a whole life insurance
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.260]   contract for your child.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.180]   I own them for my children.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.700]   Does it make it right?
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.020]   Does it mean your situation is the same as mine?
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.460]   Does it mean you value the same things that I value?
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.580]   Just simply saying I'm not opposed to your purchasing whole life insurance contracts
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.580]   for your children.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.060]   I'm opposed to your purchasing whole life insurance contract for your children as a
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:06.620]   primary means of paying for college or where the primary motivation is not the benefit
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.200]   of owning the life insurance contract, having the death benefit in place, the benefit of
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.620]   having and protecting your child's ability to buy insurance in the future or the benefit
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:23.980]   of having some cash value accumulation over the long term but that will be after college.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:31.860]   Just opposed to using it as a primary vehicle for college funding.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:41.140]   Now how could you use life insurance in an effective and efficient way to pay for college?
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:50.300]   Notice that all of the previous conversation was reflective of a life insurance contract
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.420]   where your child is the insured.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.660]   What if your child is not the insured?
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:07.100]   Well, if your child is not the insured, that opens up many more options and many more opportunities.
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.900]   Let's pretend for a moment that you don't have children yet.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.700]   Just go with an ideal scenario.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:22.580]   Could you purchase a large whole life insurance policy that will accumulate cash value effectively
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:28.800]   over the next 15 to 20 to 25 years with the intention of keeping it in force for much
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.860]   longer than that?
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.220]   You absolutely could and that's one of the ways that life insurance contracts can be
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.220]   used.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.580]   Because it's not tied to the life of your child, you would be able to buy a larger contract
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.860]   to be able to get more money into it where the savings were more meaningful.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.340]   Because the policy were flexible, you wouldn't have to use it for college if you found other
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.020]   opportunities, other alternatives.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:01.460]   Now what if you bought such a contract and you scheduled it to make sure that during
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.180]   the time that your child is in college, you wouldn't have to make premium payments if
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.180]   you didn't want to?
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.740]   This is my favorite plan.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.100]   This is what I did a couple of times as an insurance agent.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.780]   As long-time listeners of the show will know, I'm pretty good at talking people out of saving
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.700]   in college savings accounts.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:30.820]   If it's important to you, great, but I'm pretty good at talking people out of it, simply recognizing
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.740]   that that shouldn't be the first place to focus.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.380]   Wealthy parents pay for college for their children.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.140]   So let's focus on being wealthy and let's make sure that we're flexible during that
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.100]   time we're paying for college.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:55.060]   Because the college situation is so unknown, we don't know what the FAFSA is going to be
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.500]   in 15 years.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.300]   We don't know who the president is going to be.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.860]   We don't know if college is going to be free.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:10.340]   I personally, now who knows, my politics, my political crystal ball is often wrong,
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:15.780]   but I see very good indication to say that there will be many options to go to college
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:21.900]   without paying out of pocket for it in 15 years, 10 to 15 years.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:30.100]   Today, any student who is academically capable and wants to can earn enough money working
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:36.460]   part-time at a fast food restaurant to pay and get an accredited degree from a low cost
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.860]   online university or distance learning or local community college.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.660]   It's not hard to pay for college.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.140]   So I like the parent to have flexibility.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:54.460]   So what I have often done, if the parent has the desire or the need or the desire to own
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:59.780]   life insurance, if it fills some of those financial goals, their financial needs, the
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.480]   primary one being, "Hey, I want to have a whole life insurance contract that stays in
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.480]   force forever.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.780]   I'm well insured for the temporary needs.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.820]   Temporary life insurance needs should always be covered with term life insurance, but I'd
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.860]   like to have some insurance that lasts forever."
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.300]   That's a really good start to fit to say, "Oh, life insurance is an appropriate fit."
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.180]   I'd like to have some money accumulating within a life insurance contract.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:28.380]   I like to keep some of my portfolio in a place that is safe where it's steady growth.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:34.500]   I know that I'm giving up a significant amount of potential upside in terms of my total return,
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.140]   but I like to have some money that's safe and steady.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.100]   It makes me feel good that it's protected from annual taxation.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.460]   It's growing tax deferred.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.460]   Yes, I may or may not pay taxes on it when I take it out, but it's growing tax deferred
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.460]   for now.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.500]   I like the flexibility of it.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.500]   If the client, notice that was pretty elegant sales language there, and that wasn't as elegant
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.800]   as I could make it, but if the prospective client or prospective purchaser of a life
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:07.340]   insurance contract is using phrases like that or is agreeing to phrases like that, now we
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.260]   have a good fit for life insurance.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.220]   How do we design it so that they can use the policy for college?
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.820]   My first goal is that they not use the policy for college.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.780]   My goal is that they just pay for college.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:27.900]   What I would do in a financial planning situation is I would work very hard to make sure that
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.980]   if a parent knows the years that their child is likely to be in college in advance, they
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:38.500]   work hard to lower their expenses during those years.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.620]   That means get on track to have a mortgage paid off during those college years if possible.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:49.340]   It's very reasonable that many parents in the younger years, whether children are young
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.380]   and they're starting to think about buying college accounts, because after all, that's
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.300]   the scenario we're in here of buying a life insurance contract at an early age.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.780]   This doesn't work if you're looking at a 10-year-old.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.700]   It doesn't work at all, but it certainly doesn't work with a 10-year-old.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.340]   It works the best for a one-month-old, and even there it doesn't work.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.100]   It just doesn't work to buy the contract the way that most people think about.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:20.300]   But can you have a house paid off by the time your child is 18 years old?
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:26.260]   Many people, if not most, who think ahead and plan can be in a situation where they
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:31.180]   have their house paid off when their child is 18 years old and heading off to college.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.500]   If you don't have a personal mortgage payment to make every month, can you afford to make
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.580]   payments to a university?
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.140]   The answer is yes.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.720]   But let's go a little farther than that.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.380]   Can you make sure that your cars are paid off during that time period?
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.060]   Very few people think strategically about their needs for transportation.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.060]   They don't time it.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.020]   They sign up for a loan and they don't know how long it's going to last, and they just
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.620]   don't think about it.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.700]   Think about it.
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:02.420]   Make sure that you don't wind up making car payments during the years in which your child
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.460]   is in college.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.380]   Let's say your mortgage payment was $1,000.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.020]   Now let's take away a $400 car payment.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.580]   We're at $1,400.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:21.340]   $1,400 a month buys you a lot of tuition, and you can do it without stress.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:28.020]   The tax savings of saving for college, because it's so short term, are negligible.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.100]   I'd rather you just pay out of cash flow in general.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:40.300]   Now if you've saved diligently in retirement accounts, can you also have those assets not
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:49.100]   be listed on your FAFSA so that they're not counted against your child's financial aid
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.100]   opportunities?
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.100]   Yes.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:59.900]   If you've saved in something like a Roth IRA, you can take out your contributions and use
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:05.060]   that money without paying any income tax because we're just distributing contributions.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.420]   You can use that money to pay for college if you desire, and you can leave your earnings
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:13.820]   inside the Roth IRA to grow tax-free.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:25.420]   In addition, if you've saved diligently into your retirement accounts all along the way,
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:30.500]   can you stop making contributions or at least not make contributions beyond the employer
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.860]   match during the years that your child is in college?
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.820]   The answer is yes, you can.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.260]   I believe that in general, that option would pay off much more than buying a life insurance
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.020]   policy on your child's life.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.020]   Better approach.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.940]   Then finally, what about life insurance?
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.900]   You thought I forgot, didn't you?
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.340]   What about life insurance?
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.540]   Buy a life insurance contract that has no premiums due during the years your child is
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.140]   in college so that you can do exactly the same thing.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:09.980]   If you're going to buy a whole life policy, schedule it to quick pay in about 15 years
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:17.320]   if you have a child who's younger so that you can drop that off.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:23.120]   Even if your policy is not scheduled to quick pay, quick pay meaning you either stop contributing
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.320]   to the contract or just have the dividends pay the premiums for you, start taking your
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.140]   dividends and apply your dividends to the premium.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.500]   There you can free up a few hundred dollars.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:39.300]   I'd much rather somebody have a life insurance contract and with let's say that at that point
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.100]   in time their premiums are $500 a month, but at that point they've got the equivalent of
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.380]   $350 a month of dividends.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.740]   Let's just apply those dividends to the premium payment.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:55.280]   They pay out of pocket $150 and the other $350 a month gets freed up to be used for
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.780]   tuition payments.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:03.960]   If your child winds up going to an elite Ivy League school and you've accumulated money
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.260]   in all of those scenarios and you need to take money out of the life insurance policy,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:18.280]   if you've got a big policy for you or a big policy for your wife, that's a really good
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.720]   way to do it.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.960]   Just take out a loan on your big policy, use that to pay the tuition payments and then
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.960]   pay the loan back on your life insurance contract over a short period of time.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.120]   That's the most efficient way to do it.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.360]   Because you're taking the money out of your life insurance contract in the form of a loan,
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.720]   there's no income reported.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.020]   Because there's no income reported, there's no income reported on the FAFSA.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:52.140]   You continue to be in good shape where your FAFSA is well set up and you've accumulated
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.900]   money in a very efficient way.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.180]   Hope that's helpful.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.740]   Hope that's clear.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.780]   In summary, the question is this, what are your thoughts on using whole life insurance
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.860]   as a college savings plan?
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.620]   If you don't like it, why?
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.660]   Direct summary or answer to that question, summary of the show is this.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:22.620]   I don't think life insurance contracts on the life of your children work well for college
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:28.760]   savings because I've never seen one that accumulated enough money where it was worth the hassle.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.300]   This is due to the fundamental characteristics of whole life insurance where the costs are
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:38.160]   up front, the investment return tends to be lower than other opportunities because it's
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.080]   a fixed income portfolio, and the tax savings are generally negligible because of the low
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:50.580]   investment return and because of the short period of time for the money to grow.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.720]   So I don't recommend that you use that as a primary way of paying for college.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.620]   There are more efficient ways.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:05.060]   I do recommend that you can consider using a whole life insurance contract on yourself
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.700]   or on your spouse, and that can be a backup plan for college.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:18.040]   But my favorite way to pay for college is just simply for you not to save for college,
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:24.460]   but for you to plan to pay out of pocket for college when that time arrives.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.900]   That in my opinion is the very best way to do it.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.300]   Don't forget about all the other fundamentals, shop for college aggressively, apply for student
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.920]   loans aggressively, et cetera.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:41.560]   But I think that's the best way to use life insurance to plan for college.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.600]   That's it for my show today.
