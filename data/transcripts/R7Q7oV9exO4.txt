[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   A listener named Calvin, great name, from Singapore, writes us today with a Bible question
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.800]   on Matthew 8.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.040]   Pastor John, thank you for your ministry and for this podcast, which I've benefited from
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   greatly.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.000]   My question is over Matthew 8, verses 28 to 34.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.320]   In this text, why did the demons ask Jesus' permission to be sent into the pigs when those
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.360]   pigs would be immediately drowned?
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.480]   Where else would they have gone, and where did they go after the whole herd rushed down
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.720]   the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters?
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.360]   This has always perplexed me.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   Pastor John, what can you tell Calvin?
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.440]   Not everybody knows this story, so probably we should read that section from Matthew 8
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680]   that he's referring to.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.600]   When Jesus came to the other side, so this is starting at verse 28 of Matthew 8.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.280]   When Jesus came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.160]   men met him, coming out of the tomb so fierce that no one could pass that way.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.800]   And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O son of God?
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.400]   Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.080]   Now, a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them, and the demons begged
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.720]   him, saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs."
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.840]   And he said to them, "Go."
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.600]   So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.360]   bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.980]   The herdsmen fled.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.560]   Going into the city, they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.640]   men.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.480]   And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.600]   And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   Like, what?
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   What?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.240]   Oh, my goodness, the great liberator has come!
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.640]   And they tell him to get out.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.760]   So before we get into the less clear and more perplexing parts of the story, let's just
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.680]   be sure that we don't miss what is crystal clear.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.380]   Number one, the demons know who Jesus is.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.680]   They call him the Son of God.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.000]   Number two, they know that he has absolute power over them and can choose either to cast
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.840]   them out or not and to decide where they go.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.400]   There's no negotiation here as if they were equal partners at the negotiating table.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.800]   Jesus is superior, and they know it.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.760]   Three, they know that in the future they are appointed for final torment, and they wonder
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   if Jesus has come to start that final judgment.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.760]   They say, "Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.000]   You know, we know there's a time coming when we're going to get final torment, but not
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.200]   yet, Jesus.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Or is it?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.600]   Or is it?
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.720]   And then number four, the fact that there was a herd of pigs nearby shows that we are
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.520]   in Gentile territory, since the Jews regarded pigs as unclean, Deuteronomy 14.8, and did
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.840]   not raise them for food or anything.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.120]   In other words, this is one of those rare moments when Jesus is reaching out into the
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.880]   Gentile world as a pointer to the fact that his ministry is going to result in a global
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.360]   mission to all the peoples of the world, Matthew 28, 19, and 20.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.120]   Number five, the number of pigs isn't mentioned in Matthew like it is in Mark 2000, but the
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.680]   herd is called "large," so that when the demons go out from the two demonized men into the
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.280]   herd and they all perish, we get the very clear sense of how big, how large, how serious
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.360]   this man's bondage was, or these men's bondage was, and how even this was no problem for
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   Jesus.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.140]   Number six, the fact that the demons pleaded to be sent into the pigs shows how much they
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.880]   hated roaming about in the world without any habitation.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:50.240]   This seems to point to how evil they are and how the maximizing of their evil comes from
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.480]   entering into any kind of being they can get their hands on to ruin their lives.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.120]   Number seven, but the demons could not have seen—this is part of what he asks—the
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.640]   demons could not have seen that their new habitation, the pigs, would suddenly run down
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.280]   the hill and all drown, because if in fact they saw that coming, they wouldn't have
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.840]   asked for it.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.440]   That's not what they were trying to do.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.280]   They were trying to get a new place to live and do damage, not a place to be destroyed
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.980]   in the sea.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:35.960]   And from what we know of Jesus in the Gospels, he would have known what was about to happen,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.360]   so that what they feared—namely, that he was here ahead of time to begin their final
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.280]   judgment—was in fact true.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:54.720]   He had not let them escape into some lesser being for the misery they had brought on this
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:03.120]   couple of men, but he had appointed them to depart, as it turns out, without any habitation.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:11.560]   And the fact that it was lost in the sea points to the fact that he was sentencing them probably
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.960]   to the abyss.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:25.320]   Now, all that seems more or less clear, but is there more that can be said as to why Jesus
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.000]   would bring about the destruction of the pigs?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.880]   And the last two verses are very surprising, and I think they encourage us to go further
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.980]   in our thinking.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:48.320]   They say, "The herdsmen fled, going into the city, and told everything"—and it
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.240]   doesn't say especially about the pigs; it says especially about what happened to the
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.680]   demon-possessed men.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.720]   In other words, they foregrounded deliverance and liberation and freedom and healing.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.200]   "And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.120]   him to leave their region."
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.040]   Now, two amazing things have happened in this Gentile region suddenly and by the power of
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040]   Jesus.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:21.400]   Number one, two demon-possessed men were now free, and their humanity was restored.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.800]   Their relationships were restored.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.280]   I wrote a poem one time just making up the fact that they were married, perhaps, and
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.640]   had children, and their lives were ruined, and their families' lives were ruined, and
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.520]   maybe, I don't know.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.640]   But they were ruined, and now they're not ruined anymore.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.160]   Their humanity is given back to them.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.320]   And the second amazing thing that happened was a large herd of pigs was destroyed.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.720]   Now what this causes me to ponder is another situation in the Bible where Satan attempted
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.680]   to negotiate with God, namely, in the first two chapters of Job.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:05.880]   Satan asks permission to afflict Job, and God gave Satan permission, which proved to
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.800]   be a test of Job's faithfulness to God.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:19.120]   Job would face the choice—you can love God and trust him, or you can love your possessions
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.640]   and your family and your health more and curse God for taking them away.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:30.520]   In other words, God used Satan to test Job.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:36.560]   Now it seems to me that's more or less what's going on here.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:43.800]   Jesus comes into this Gentile world, he conquers the devil, he sets the prisoner free, he presents
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.680]   himself as a great deliverer, able to restore life and hope, but he also takes away a herd
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.160]   of pigs, the livelihood, the wealth from some in the community.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:04.720]   He forces a choice—prosperity over love, money over Jesus, human resources over divine
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:14.520]   power—that is, the power and grace of Jesus to give life and hope, or the love of possessions
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   and wealth gotten from these pigs.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:25.520]   And to our utter amazement, they beg Jesus, the life-giver, the devil-defeater, the hope-maker
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.480]   and giver, to leave their region.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.160]   So it seems to me that the story has several levels of meaning.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.120]   One, Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.000]   Two, Jesus is triumphant over unclean spirits.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.680]   Number three, Jesus liberates the captive and gives hope to hopeless people, even Gentile
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.960]   people.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:10:00.560]   And four, but Jesus demands a choice—love him and his salvation, or love your prosperity
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.960]   and your wealth, namely your pigs.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   And they failed.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   They failed the test.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:13.960]   And Matthew reports it, I think, in the hopes that we will not fail that test.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   Indeed.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.400]   And thanks for the Bible question, Calvin.

[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.880]   How do we get tricked into sinning?
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.480]   Tricked into sinning.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.560]   That's the question on the table.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.800]   Next time, we will hear from a listener named Gabriela, who lives in Sweden, a very secular
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.720]   country, and she has needed help getting clarity on this very question in her own ministry
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.120]   to unbelievers there.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.520]   So how do we get tricked into sinning?
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.400]   I'm Tony Rehnke, and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   Bye.
