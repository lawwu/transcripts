[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   Nirvana by Charles Bukowski. Not much chance, completely cut loose from purpose.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.960]   It was a young man riding a bus to North Carolina on the way to somewhere, and it began to snow.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.840]   And the bus stopped at a little cafe in the hills, and the passengers entered, and he sat
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.280]   at the counter with the others, and he ordered. The food arrived, and the meal was particularly good.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.040]   And the coffee. The waitress was unlike the women he had known. She was unaffected,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.440]   and there was a natural humor which came from her. And the fry cook said crazy things,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.600]   and the dishwasher in the back laughed a good, clean, pleasant laugh. And the young man watched
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.000]   the snow through the window, and he wanted to stay in that cafe forever. The curious feelings
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.760]   swam through him that everything was beautiful there, and it would always stay beautiful there.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.160]   And then the bus driver told the passengers that it was time to board,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.400]   and the young man thought, "I'll just stay here. I'll just stay here."
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:22.240]   And then he rose, and he followed the others into the bus. He found his seat and looked at
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.200]   the cafe through the window, and then the bus moved off down a curve downward out of the hills.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.400]   And the young man looked straight forward, and he heard the other passengers speaking of
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.800]   other things, or they were reading or trying to sleep, and they hadn't noticed the magic.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.040]   And the young man put his head to one side, closed his eyes, and pretended to sleep.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.800]   There was nothing else to do, just to listen to the sound of the engine
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.400]   and the sound of the tires in the snow.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.440]   you
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.080]   you
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.120]   you
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.620]   you
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.580]   you
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.660]   you
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.700]   you
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.200]   you
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
