[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:50.320]   with Nick Loper from Side Hustle Nation. Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.960]   is Joshua Sheets and today is Monday, January 19, 2015. This is the show where we teach you how to
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.920]   make money today, how to make a little bit of extra money on the side and inspire your creativity
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.560]   in the hopes that you'll go out and improve your cash flow. And today, I'm going to primarily give
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:23.840]   you ideas for unique ways to accomplish that. My guest today is a man named Nick Loper and Nick is
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:32.160]   the author and the founder of Side Hustle Nation. The website is sidehustlenation.com. He hosts a
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.080]   show called the Side Hustle Show, a podcast. And the entire focus of his site and of his work
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.200]   is clearly indicated in the title. He's all about how to build up something on the side that will
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.280]   allow you to increase your income for whatever purpose you have for increasing your income.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.120]   And maybe that would lead into a new business of some kind. One of the things that we explore on
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.280]   the show quite a bit is income, how to improve and increase your income. There's probably a point of
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.640]   diminishing returns at which this is simply not a priority. But for many of us, that is a major
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.360]   focus and there are many ways to produce income. We talk a lot about ways to produce income at your
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.360]   current job, in your current business. But one sure-fired way of creating additional income is
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.480]   to do more work. And for many people, that's more effectively done with some sort of side project,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.200]   some sort of side job. And the market for side projects, side jobs has dramatically changed.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.800]   Now, whether this is something that you need to do temporarily or it's an ongoing focus,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.400]   whether it's something that you're doing as a way of transitioning from what you are doing into a
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   new business, that's up to you. And obviously, you'll have to decide that within your own context.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.680]   But I've watched over the last few years just some really exciting trends of just new opportunities
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   that have never existed. In general, I see a transition available to people to do more and
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.320]   more work in unique niches. And you'll hear in the interview that Nick and I talk a little bit
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.960]   about that, about how to put together full-time income from multiple side projects. And there's
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.080]   an increasing trend in this direction in industry. My hope is that today's interview simply sparks
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.840]   your creativity and gives you some ideas so that instead of simply going and delivering pizzas,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.000]   which is certainly a valid option, you can use that as a metaphor and find something that might
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.200]   lead to broader exposure, might lead to more opportunities. This can be a really, really
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.840]   helpful strategy to just get you over the hump. Perhaps you're working a job that you love and
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.160]   in a career in an environment that you really enjoy, which by the way, I've got a show on my
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.200]   show list that I've been meaning to do of all the amazing benefits of working at a steady job in a
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   steady corporation. I have tried to balance the tone a little bit on the show instead of focusing
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.680]   so much on entrepreneurship, just simply recognizing that there are pros and cons,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.840]   because I really do believe there are pros and cons. And for me, I prefer entrepreneurship,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.040]   but there are many people and there are many advantages to working in just a steady corporation
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.800]   where you have a steady paycheck. But continuing with the point, whether it's something you're
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.920]   doing as a temporary method, just increase your income or whatever your reason, that's up to you.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.480]   But I hope this interview with Nick will bring you some ideas and I encourage you to check out
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.120]   his content. One of the things I'm trying to do on the show, I hope you find it helpful.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.040]   If there's a particular topic that I'm not going to create the side hustle nation,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.240]   Nick's already done it. I don't see any reason to spend any of my energy trying to create that.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.280]   And so I love to profile people who might be a resource for you. And if you are in need of a way
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.880]   to earn some extra income, go check out his show and listen to a bunch of his episodes, and maybe
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.520]   that will fuel your creativity and help you. And then feel free to come on back over here when you
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.920]   need to. That's why I bring you some of these shows, is to profile some resources that might
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.960]   be helpful for you. Again, I don't see any point in trying to do something that somebody else is
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.760]   doing well. There are so many massive needs, especially with regard to finance, that I prefer
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.240]   to focus on the things that I don't see being done well. And so although I want to bring you ideas
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   from time to time, I thought the best way to bring you some of these ideas would be in the context of
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.360]   an interview. And now for more information, if this is of great interest to you, then go on over
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.600]   and check out some of Nick's content. Enough talking, let's get to it. So Nick, welcome to
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.000]   the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I appreciate you being with me today. What's happening, man?
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.480]   Been looking forward to having you on. We met originally at Podcast Movement,
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.400]   was that six months ago at this point? And I was intrigued with the concept of your site,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.040]   Side Hustle Nation. And I wasn't previously familiar with it. After meeting you, though,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.000]   I had gone back and looked through some of your content and just was fascinated with what you're
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.280]   doing. I thought it would be extremely valuable content to bring to my audience. So what I'd love
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.320]   to start with, though, is introduce the genesis of Side Hustle Nation. What's your story? What
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.920]   were you doing and how did Side Hustle Nation come out of that? This was my way of spreading
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.280]   the gospel of this lower risk brand of entrepreneurship, saying, hey, you don't need to
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.040]   jump off the cliff into the unknown. You can start a business on the side. You can ramp this thing up
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.320]   as slowly, as quickly as you want, but do it in a way that you're comfortable with. Because that
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.560]   was my experience. It was three years of nights and weekends for me before I felt comfortable
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.600]   quitting my job. And even then, it took a couple of beers to get up the nerve when I was talking
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.360]   with my boss at dinner. And I don't know how people do it. I'm going to find a way to pay
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.720]   the rent next month. And they just go. And it's like, well, that's not me. And I don't think
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.000]   that's for the percentage of the population that's more risk averse like me. This is the site for
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.080]   you. How to earn money outside of your day job while keeping that day job. What was the business
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.600]   you were engaged in previously? I had a comparison shopping site for shoes called Shoesniper.com.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.280]   And then the business that you transitioned to was Side Hustle Nation?
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.240]   So it's transitioned. So I should back it up. So on my first day of self-employment,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:46.000]   of all days, Google decides this is the day they're going to crawl my site for quality scores.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.320]   And as luck would have it, it's also the day that the server decides to crash. And so, of course,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.920]   they crawl the site. They say, hey, look, this is horrible. It doesn't even load. We can't let
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.880]   you advertise with us. Like, whatever. This is temporary. This is fine. We'll get it fixed.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.800]   And then even then, once the site was back up and running, it had kind of raised this red flag
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.520]   for them. So the site was monetized through referral relationships, affiliate relationships.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.840]   If somebody bought a pair of shoes through the site, the store would send a finder's fee or
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.640]   commission back to me. And so they looked at the site and said, this is a crappy affiliate site.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:26.160]   Your sole purpose of existing is to drive traffic to other websites. And I said, that's the sole
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.400]   purpose of Google for existing. Who are you to talk? But they were serious because that was like
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   80 percent of my traffic. So it took the whole summer. And so that was a very stressful summer.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.640]   I used to have hair before that time. Trying to get back into their good graces and learn how to
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.880]   make a site that was acceptable to them in terms of the value add for their users.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:59.280]   But I guess it opened my eyes. Because my whole shtick is on diversification. If you're relying
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.400]   on one source of income, your day job, for example, you're in an inherently risky position.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:11.440]   And then once I quit, I was in essentially the same risky position because I was relying
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.600]   on just the shoe business as my one source of income. And worse than that,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.120]   that one source of traffic determined a big percentage of it. So from there, I was always
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:27.760]   interested in starting other side hustles, other websites, other experiments, other projects. And
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.160]   so that was kind of and that's accelerated with the Side Hustle Nation blog and podcast
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.480]   to have an outlet, to have an excuse to talk about all these different things that people are doing.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.680]   - One of the reasons why I was most excited to bring you on is because your entire focus is
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.640]   helping people build part-time, build side income. And I guess the modern way of saying a part-time
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.840]   job is the side hustle. I like the nomenclature. I don't know where it came from, but it seems like
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.160]   that's the standard way of referring to it. And one of the themes that on my show, I continually
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.920]   talk about is the wheel of financial planning. And the amount of income that we earn is one
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.120]   important component of financial planning. In order to increase our wealth, we only have a few
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.400]   levers that we can push. And one of those levers that we can push is the amount of income that we
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:31.040]   can earn. But for many people, it feels difficult to generate extra income simply out of employment.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.480]   Perhaps they're on a salaried basis or on an hourly basis and there aren't overtime opportunities
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:43.600]   available. And so in this scenario, you're pushed in the direction of needing to find some kind of
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.320]   extra work. And so that means part-time job, that means some sort of side business. What intrigues
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:58.720]   me though is how what I've observed in the last five or 10 years, the just massive proliferation
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.600]   of opportunities that has come about. It used to be, Dave Ramsey is famous for saying, "Go deliver
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.320]   pizzas." And he means that as a metaphor for some kind of part-time job. But to me, those part-time
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.120]   jobs, whether it's delivering pizzas or waiting tables at night or bartending bar, things like
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   that, they have some potential. But they're not, they all have a cap on them as far as the amount
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.120]   of income that can be earned. But there are many more exciting opportunities emerging. And
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.960]   especially with some of the electronic connectivity that we all enjoy now. So what I'd love to spend
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.720]   the bulk of our time today talking about is discussing some of the opportunities that you
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:46.000]   see in your work that are really exciting of how people are generating income on the side with
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.440]   their side hustle. What are you seeing as some of the biggest growth areas of the types of
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.880]   businesses that people are starting? There are the different types of services that they're
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.840]   offering. What are you seeing as having the biggest growth right now? You bet. And I like
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:09.680]   to focus on the earning potential side because the other part of the equation is your spending.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:17.600]   And you can only save so much before you're living in a grass hut. And there's only so much you can
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.640]   cut, right? Okay, I stopped cable, I stopped buying my coffee, whatever it is. But your earning
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   potential is potentially limitless or hopefully in theory, limitless. And I like the idea of
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.000]   delivering pizza. I think that's a good metaphor because it is, even though it's not something
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.280]   that's time leveraged, it's something that's immediate. There's instant gratification. And
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:50.400]   you're going to find similar things with a lot of the freelancing stuff, the sharing economy stuff,
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.200]   the Airbnbs, the Uber drivers of the world. A friend of mine sent me a note a couple months
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.120]   ago and said, "We made, him and his girlfriend, have made two grand in the last few months
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.360]   dog sitting." And there's a couple of sites, dog.ak is one and rover.com is another. They're
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.280]   like Airbnb but for dogs. And I was like, "Oh my gosh." And hearing that totally made me want to
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.920]   set up shop and try it out because it's like, "Oh shoot, we already got one dog. I can walk
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.520]   two of them at the same time too. That's fine." So those are some of the fastest ways I think
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:32.080]   to get started is to tap into some of those existing marketplaces or the sharing economy,
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:38.480]   the peer-to-peer economy, like driving for Uber and Lyft and doing the Airbnb, the dog sitting.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:45.680]   I think of what would be another one. Shoot, I had a guy on the show who makes his full-time
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.280]   living just buying and selling stuff on Craigslist. It's nuts. And he does appliances.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:57.920]   Think about the biggest, bulkiest, hard-to-transfer item that you can think of.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.400]   You're talking about Ryan Finlay, right?
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.040]   Absolutely.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.280]   Yeah. I also interviewed him on my show some months back and I was fascinated with his
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:12.080]   blog for at least a couple of years. And he's got such an amazing story of just,
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.880]   again, creating a business off of this thing that I would never think of doing. And yet,
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.120]   he supports his income and he got out of debt and he's built a nice little business for himself
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.920]   buying and selling appliances on Craigslist. But there are many people doing that actually,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.160]   not only with appliances but all these little niches. Have you had exposure to other people
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.600]   doing something similar on Craigslist?
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:45.200]   It's not something I've tried myself. Actually, my Lyft driver in Dallas for a podcast movement,
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.760]   we got in touch. I said, "Hey, I'm going to this podcast conference." He's like, "Oh, my God. I'm
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.840]   driving all day. Every day, I love podcasts. I'll check out your show." And so, he sent me a note
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.360]   after the episode with Ryan and was like, "Oh, my gosh. I found my first thing. I got it on the free
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.400]   section of Craigslist and I made like $300 this week." I was like, "Oh, my gosh. That's awesome."
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.760]   So, people taking action and I like Ryan's approach. I want to make $50 a day. I want to
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.480]   make $100 a day and just looking for those deals to go out and go after.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.040]   So, let's talk about the sharing economy because this is a topic that fascinates me.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:26.960]   The big ones are Uber and Lyft for the car services. Do you think those are viable ways
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.240]   for people to build some part-time income as it stands today in January 2015?
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.960]   Yeah, absolutely. I think you can get started right away and especially if you live in or near
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.520]   a big metro area. The demand just keeps going up for that stuff. So, that's a pretty cool one.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.240]   What are the requirements for somebody who has a car? Is it any person with any car can
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.600]   sign up as a driver or what are their requirements to get started as a driver?
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:16:00.560]   Well, thankfully, I was asking Harry Campbell who's like the rideshare guy.com about this and
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.640]   he says you got to have a car that's 2006 or newer in pretty good shape and I think they do some sort
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.840]   of background check or like test drive with you with somebody who's local on the ground.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.520]   But, you could be up and running within a week if you submit your application and get it done.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:24.080]   Okay. Also, then Airbnb. So, we all at this point, I would assume we're probably familiar
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.760]   with this. The idea of just renting out a part of your house. Are people doing this and generating
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:36.800]   substantial income from it? Yeah, absolutely. So, I found a guy who actually has an apartment
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.560]   in Amsterdam and so he started out renting out a room in it, renting out two rooms in it.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.280]   And then he was like, "Forget that. I'm going to rent out the whole thing and I'm going to go
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.880]   travel myself." And so, he's actually ended up making a full lifestyle business out of it. I
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.880]   think he cleared like 60 grand last year from this one apartment and he was in Brazil when I talked
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.640]   to him. It's just nuts. So, you never know. And he made the episode because my beef with that was
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.400]   like, "Look, we're out in the suburbs. Who would want to stay here?" And he's like, "Look, if you
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.000]   have hotels in your town, then there's obviously a demand for it." And I was like, "Well, I guess
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.360]   you're right because there's a handful of every chain hotel two miles away from us. So, maybe
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.080]   there is a market." So, not something that I've tested out yet, but it's something to think about
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.360]   for sure. Are there other sites that are coming online to compete with Airbnb that you're aware
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.520]   of that people are starting to use? The other one that I've heard of is like Wimdo, which is like a
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.680]   European knockoff of it. I don't know if they have the same traffic. Okay. Other of the sharing
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:50.080]   economy, you mentioned dog walking. Are there any other variations of this? Sharing your boat,
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.480]   sharing your yard, sharing your parking space, things like that that you're aware of that people
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:01.280]   are using? Oh, my gosh. There's one for every niche imaginable. The one I wanted to try was
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.720]   airport parking. What was it called? Relay rides. They're out of San Francisco Airport.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.920]   And they wouldn't take my car because it was over 100,000 miles. But they offer free airport
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.400]   parking and they would rent it out to somebody while you're on your trip. And so, you have
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.280]   potential to park for free and earn money if somebody actually rented your car. But they
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.600]   wouldn't take mine because it was too old. But for everything imaginable, like park atmyhouse.com,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.000]   I believe is one of them. There's just a ton. Rent your snowboard while you're not using it.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.520]   I forget the sites for all these. But for any kind of asset you have, which is cool in the big
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.120]   picture, right? Because we can get by with owning less stuff and become more efficient with our
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.240]   resources, more minimalist and stuff. So, I think that's really cool. Talk to me about some of the
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:59.600]   online freelancing kind of service offerings and explain how, if I'm looking and saying,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.160]   "Well, I don't have any stuff that I'm not going to share my apartment with friends, but I do maybe
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.280]   have some skills." What would be the process of going through and figuring out how to find some
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:16.480]   clients and generate some skills with some of the new online listing sites? You bet. You bet.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:24.000]   There's... So, I had Brian Harris on the show recently from videofruit.com. Super, super smart
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.520]   guy. And so, he makes the argument that there's three main ways to make money online. He said,
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:36.400]   "You can sell advertising. You can sell affiliate stuff, which typically requires a ton of traffic
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.520]   to make it interesting. You can sell a product. You could sell a physical product. You could sell
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.880]   an e-book, a course or something like that, which is cool. That's something that I've done.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:52.080]   And it still requires a little bit of an audience, a little bit of a platform. Or you can,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:58.560]   unless you really hit it right with Amazon or some of these other places, he's like, "Or you can sell
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.200]   a service." He makes the argument that selling a service is the fastest way to get started because
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:09.760]   you don't need a website. You don't need to create a product. And you can just go out and find a
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.200]   customer, find your first customer. All of a sudden, you're in business. And so, he's like,
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.920]   "What do you...?" It's kind of the classic question. "What do people ask you for help about?
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.880]   And what are you more knowledgeable about than the average person?" But beyond that, he said,
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.600]   "Look, if you can find the epic how-to resource guide that somebody has posted on their blog,
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:36.640]   you could be the guy that just does that. You don't even need to invent this service necessarily.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.920]   Somebody has spelled out the step-by-step thing. And the one I found recently was,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:50.880]   "How to get your website SEO penalty removed," or something like the 12-step thing. And it's
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.040]   time-intensive to do that. But here it is. It's all spelled out for you. So, if you have some
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.200]   working knowledge of the basics of this stuff, go find a customer who would be interested in this.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.600]   I like it. One of the things I see, and those three categories make a lot of sense to me,
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.880]   because even with my experience with Radical Personal Finance, I originally started off and
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:17.600]   simply said, "The most direct way for me to earn income off of my efforts here would be to sell my
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.920]   own services, to sell my own financial planning services." And I received lots of inquiries for
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:28.880]   that. And that actually would be the most direct way for me to earn income. Products have their
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.480]   place. They're less direct. And I have to create something that solves the needs of the audience.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.600]   But it's more direct than, I don't need quite as big of an audience as I do for mass advertising
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.360]   or affiliate links. But all of them can be effective and functional. But just by focusing
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.360]   on the service, to me, this seems much more genuine. Because essentially what's happening
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:58.640]   is the role of the doorkeeper is diminished. And it used to be that if you were going to get
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:06.160]   involved in an industry or get involved in an industry or in a job, in a profession,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.800]   you needed to get past all of the gatekeepers. And you needed to get the stamps of approval
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.760]   put on you by the powers that be. You needed to get the job. You need to get in with the company.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:22.400]   You need to get all of this external proof. Because it was difficult for one individual
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:29.120]   to start to be able to publish and publicize their services on an inexpensive basis.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.720]   The closest parallel that we had for being able to do this was, the only way you could do it
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.400]   previously was advertising, which was traditionally through mainstream channels, would have been very
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.960]   expensive. Or through things like direct marketing, direct mail. All of those things are fairly
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.120]   expensive. But now when with minimal cost you can get your message out there, then if you can help
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.960]   your message, there's a whole new challenge to it, but if you can help your message get found by the
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.880]   right person, then you cut down the barrier. You don't have to go through the Washington Times
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.400]   for them to approve your ad and run your ad and you pay their fees to gain access to the customers.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.600]   You have Google. You have the ability to get in front of the people that matter.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:21.520]   And so I think one of the skill sets that we need to gain as a population of people paying attention
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.360]   is that skill set of self-marketing. Always managing our brand, managing the skills that
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.640]   we're marketing, whether that's unique technical skills or whatever they are, we've got to take
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.520]   that on. And this is a whole new skill set that's never existed in the past because we just went and
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.320]   found the job doing something for somebody else. My friend Julian Gordon has a quote. He says,
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:50.800]   "We're all already entrepreneurs. Our employer is just our biggest client." And it's kind of the
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.480]   mindset shift of, "Okay, look, I'm going to have to go and get this done and make something happen."
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.720]   In most cases, all it is is an email to say, "Hey, I saw you might be interested in such and
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:12.160]   such a service. I've worked with blank insert name here to build trust." And then you're off to the
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:20.400]   races. I've always been interested in the idea of doing things like putting a wrap on my car and
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.760]   selling that service. I used to drive a lot and I always thought that would be interesting. What do
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:31.840]   you know about things like that? I know I had my virtual assistant research. I wanted to put a
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   shoe sniper sticker or something on my car. They're like, "Then every mile I drive could be a
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.000]   deduction. It could be advertising expense." And they were very much like, "No, no, here's the IRS
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.320]   regulation. That's not how it works. That's not allowed." But there are companies out there. I've
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.680]   yet to find a super, super legit one. So I found a couple that were kind of shady. So I'm not sure
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:01.520]   if it's a fragmented local market for people. Somebody used to park in our neighborhood. It was
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.560]   like some juice company their car was wrapped with. So I assume they were getting paid for that
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:13.200]   unless they worked for the company. But those ones have always been intriguing for me. So if you know
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.520]   of any legit operators in that space, definitely let me know. No, I haven't found one. When I
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.920]   researched it in the past with my car, I found, A, your car has to be pretty new and fancy,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:30.160]   and mine wasn't. And B, nothing felt fully legitimate. Everything just felt a little bit
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:41.280]   shady to me. And it seemed as though the people in the middle weren't quite legit.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:49.440]   What about Fiverr, Odesk, Elance, these types of services? If I've got some specific skills,
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:56.480]   how can I get started with those types of sites, publicizing my work and making a little bit of
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:04.160]   side money? So I really like the idea of tapping into these existing marketplaces, these existing
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.680]   platforms. Because when you're just starting out, whether you're a blogger or a freelancer
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:16.320]   or anything, getting those first customers can be tough. And so it makes sense to go where the buyers
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.040]   already are. For e-books, that's Amazon. For courses, in my case, that was udemy.com.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:32.000]   And I talked to a gentleman last year on Fiverr. And so he had the claim to fame or the sound bite,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.200]   "You earned enough money on Fiverr to buy a house within a year, in cash." And I was like,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.360]   "This is just nuts." Because I had used Fiverr for years as a buyer, but never had even given
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.760]   a second thought to selling stuff. What could I possibly sell for $5 that wouldn't make me go
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:55.280]   crazy? And he made the point, "Look, this is the marketplace of goods and services starting at $5."
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.320]   Which was, I didn't think I'd bought any of the upsells at that point, so I didn't really
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:08.000]   realize that. So starting at $5. And he made the point that, "Look, all of your $5 gigs can just
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.600]   be digital deliveries, or really quick deliveries that don't take up a ton of your time. And then
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.960]   in the gig extras, if somebody really wants to engage with you, that's when you're going to start
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.200]   spending more and more of your time." And the guy is a marketing genius and cross-selling. You're
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.680]   like, "Hey, if you were interested in this, you might also be interested in this. And I noticed
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   you bought ServiceX, but it looks like we also could work together on this." And now what's
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.160]   really cool, for Fiverr, for people who've been on the platform for a little bit and have made a
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.240]   little bit of sales, you can sell whatever you want. You can send people custom quotes. I sent
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.680]   somebody a proofreading or a book editing gig the other day. It's just like, "Oh, whatever it is,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:56.400]   $140, just send it off." And they accept it. If you can engage somebody in a conversation,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:03.680]   then you can send them whatever custom project that you want now. So that's really cool. With
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.960]   Elance, with ODesk, very, very crowded. It's a global marketplace. You're competing with people
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.160]   in India and Pakistan and the Philippines and stuff. But that's okay, because there's always
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:23.200]   a point of differentiation. And I'll send you a link for the show notes. There's a couple really
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:30.320]   good podcasts I've heard on getting started on Elance specifically. Think about the position
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:36.160]   of somebody who's looking for work on there. They're looking for work because they don't
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   know somebody in their network. They don't have a guy. If I had a guy to do my whatever project I
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.920]   need done, I would just hire them. Instead of thinking of it as, "I'm going to do this project
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.360]   for this random person. I'm going to become their go-to person for whatever skill." He ended up
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:02.720]   doing some writing projects for five bucks and then was able to really prove his worth and had
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.400]   a long-term client from that. I thought that was a cool story. I'll send you a link for that.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:13.840]   The other way is to stand out. When I post jobs for Elance, it's probably the same way for you.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.160]   You get back a ton of just copy and paste crap. You didn't even read the thing. It's just like,
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.520]   "Oh, I'm so great. Check out my portfolio," blah, blah, blah. What this one guy started doing was
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.680]   sending personalized video pitches. Being very picky about which jobs he was bidding on and then
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.960]   sending a personalized video pitch. Just turning on the webcam and saying, "Hey, I'm so-and-so.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.400]   I'd love to help you out. I've worked with such and such client." No one else was doing that.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.760]   Maybe more people are doing it now. I've still yet to receive one of these things. It might be
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:53.040]   really, really cool to break out of the clutter in that sense. I've learned a little bit since
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.920]   doing my show. I'm in a position where I've never been, where all of a sudden now I've got to deal
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.280]   with all kinds of incoming messages. What's intriguing to me is how something that simple
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:10.000]   is changing the medium can make a big difference. I've had listeners, even just last night,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.480]   somebody on Twitter sent me a link to their YouTube video. Once I was assured that it wasn't
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.200]   spam, because you get these links sometimes and pretty careful about clicking on a link.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.000]   But once I was assured it wasn't actually just a virus, I went ahead and followed it and I watched
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.840]   the YouTube video they created. I've had listeners send me audio feedback in, send me an MP3 file
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:40.320]   attached to their email. I can't resist listening to them. If you think about changing the medium
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.400]   like that, I never thought of doing that and sending that to somebody. But we all have a webcam
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:52.000]   built into our phone and built into our computer. We all have an audio recorder built into our phone
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.960]   and built into our computer. Something as simple as taking the time to record a personalized audio
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:02.240]   message and then attaching that to the email right with our phone, or recording a webcam,
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:09.360]   recording a video, posting it on YouTube and attaching that link to our email. What a great
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.760]   idea for differentiation. Maybe members of the audience could take that and apply that to whatever
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.080]   their industry is. I don't see it happening a lot, but yet it's been effective when people have sent
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:25.200]   it to me. I don't know if I would be thrilled to get an audio message just from someone randomly
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.880]   on email. But if you're actively pitching a product to people who are interested in it,
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.600]   absolutely. Do whatever you can to stand out. Right, but there's got to be an interest.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.320]   Certainly, somebody spamming me from the email. They just took their telemarketing from
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:49.920]   the inbound call that was going to voicemail and attached it to an email. That doesn't do any good.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:56.640]   But if you're trying to reach out to somebody and share a personal message, perhaps you have to be
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.480]   careful where you apply it. But at least I've listened to the ones that people have sent me,
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.720]   and I've been surprised at how difficult it was for me to turn off. Even lengthy messages were
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.880]   probably, if somebody had sent me that lengthy of an email, I might not have paid much attention.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.520]   But I wound up paying attention to their audio message just because it was in a different format.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:25.120]   What about, so you write a little bit, and you had listed, you have a site, you have a page on
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:32.000]   your site of talking about ideas for side hustles. And one of the things that you're doing yourself,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.680]   and what I'm doing, is profiting essentially off of marketing information. And I always feel like
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.840]   those of us who are doing this, trying to tell people how to do things, and then making money
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.760]   off of telling people how to do things, we've got some thin ice that we're standing on. Because
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.280]   you've got to be very careful. Because it seems like the way to get rich these days is just start
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:56.080]   a blog, and make it, grow it huge, and start a podcast, and grow it huge, or start a YouTube
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:02.240]   channel and grow it huge. And certainly there are people who have done that. But yet it's a
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.120]   difficult, it's not necessarily such an easy transition. How do you coach people when they
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.360]   come to you and say, "Nick, I'm just going to, I've got a great idea for a blog. I'm going to
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.240]   start a site telling people how to make money on the side." Don't start a blog, that's what I tell
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:24.960]   them. My hourly rate from blogging is so far below minimum wage, it wouldn't be legal. It's a very,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:32.480]   very slow path. And a blog, a blog podcast in itself, it's not a business. It can be a marketing
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:39.520]   channel for your business, but it's not, until there's something to sell, until there's a really
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:45.600]   good revenue model behind it, it's not a business on its own. And that's the old joke, right? What's
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:52.240]   the best way to make money online? Sell people the secret to making money online. And it is a
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:59.280]   fine line, right? So in my goals post for this year, I addressed that saying, "Look, I want to be
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:07.120]   a practitioner more than I want to be a preacher. I want to be out testing this stuff."
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:14.560]   If I had to follow my seven-step system to internet riches, I would be doing it.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:24.400]   And so, this kind of the, you know, being out there and getting my hands dirty and like doing
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.840]   the work and then kind of sharing the results. That's been the most effective way to build the
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.640]   blog readership and to build the podcast as well, finding other people who are practitioners.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:40.160]   How do you coach people toward figuring out, they come to you and say, "Nick, I know I need to do
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.920]   something, but I just don't know what to do." Do you have some ideas for how to coach people
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.840]   through the process of figuring out what they're going to try when they're thinking about developing
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:54.480]   a side hustle? Well, I think, well, I would start with kind of an inventory of, you know,
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.240]   skills and interests and what that could be is just, you know, writing down your or dusting off
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.840]   the resumes. And like, well, any job you've ever had, by definition, someone thought that was a
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.720]   skill worth paying for, right? Because they were paying you for it. So that might be one list or
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:16.160]   one circle to kind of start with. You know, what you're interested in would be another circle. Like
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:22.720]   the last thing you need is another day job that you hate. Like you want to have something that
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:28.400]   you're at least somewhat interested in working on. And then the final circle would be like,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.240]   what kind of challenges have you overcome or what kind of hurdles have you overcome or what kind of
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.720]   problems have you solved in your own life? Because odds are other people might be facing those same
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.480]   issues, those same challenges. And in like in the context of the shoe site, you know,
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:50.000]   from their very early days, you know, what were my skills? Like, so I learned a little bit about
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.240]   online advertising at an internship that I had learned a little bit about affiliate marketing
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.840]   there. I played around building very, you know, rudimentary websites in college. And so that was
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:05.520]   kind of my inventory of skills related to that business and interests. Like I honestly was not
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.480]   interested in shoes or footwear or being a sneaker head at all, but I was interested in the process
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.920]   of building an asset, building a business, building a side hustle. And so that kind of qualified
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:22.720]   the interest box for me. And then the problem that was overcoming was just like, you kind of
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:29.840]   a frustration with the existing comparison shopping experience. Like they weren't doing a good enough
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.240]   job or they weren't delivering as accurate as a result because they had to be everything to
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.640]   everyone rather than, you know, really focusing on being excellent in one vertical. So that was
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.960]   the example of the three intersecting circles, I guess.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:52.800]   It's interesting how when you do think about overlap, by looking at various interests,
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.160]   one of the things I like about the concept of side hustle is you don't have to depend on one thing
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:04.000]   to create a living wage all at once. And I think this is what makes a lot of businesses
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.680]   find difficulty is you've got to go from, you know, the median wage is 40 something thousand
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   dollars. So I got to take my business to at least 40,000 dollars or I can't do anything or it's a
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:23.200]   no go. So it's either 40,000 dollars or nothing. But with a side hustle, you can build up a nice
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:28.960]   side income and an extra thousand dollars a month might make a very significant difference
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:34.800]   toward your goals, whatever they be. Whether it's paying off some debt or whether it's
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.440]   creating some increasing savings or purchasing a specific item that you're working toward.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.760]   The thousand dollars a month can make a substantial difference and a thousand dollars
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.640]   a month is not an unreasonable number to get with a variety of different skills and interests.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.400]   And so just the whole concept of being able to say where do my skills overlap,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.800]   where do these different, what are my different ideas and then exploring them and see what takes
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:06.080]   off. Have you had any guests on your show who have done various things, multiple side hustles
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:12.480]   that have become in the aggregate a full time source of income? Well that's what I'm doing.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.920]   But I'll give you the example. So my wife's side hustle of choice is photography. And so
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:26.400]   her and a friend, they were hobbyist photographers doing family pictures and stuff. And it was an
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.920]   interest that had grown over the years and then finally enough people were like, "You guys are
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:39.120]   kind of good." So they got the nerve up to put an ad on Craigslist and say, "We will shoot your
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.280]   wedding for you." I understand you're taking a big risk. We don't have any wedding pictures
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.920]   in our portfolio yet, but we'll shoot your wedding. And they started at like $200, very,
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:53.520]   very, very, very low end. Got flooded with responses. Never knew what to expect. Like
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.240]   who's looking for a wedding photographer on Craigslist? Apparently a lot of people.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.640]   And so they immediately upped it to 500 and then they upped it to 1,000 and then they upped it to
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.120]   2,000 and then they upped it to 3,000. And meanwhile, I'm out writing books and selling
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:10.480]   them on Amazon for 299 and she's like, "Oh, I just closed a $1,000 deal that I'm going to split with
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:20.560]   my partner." There's something that can scale up pretty quickly and it's a fascinating way to look
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:27.280]   at it. And it's just empowering. If your relationship with money is I go to work, I
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:34.480]   have this commute and I get my paycheck, it's really, really empowering and this act of
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.800]   independence when you earn that first dollar outside of your day job. Somebody who's not my
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.160]   boss paid me for something. I remember I sold my first book on Amazon two and a half years ago.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.280]   It was like, "I'm a professional author." I was like, "This is crazy." And it was like 299.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:58.320]   But it was cool. And so I got my first royalty check for $43.73. It was really, really, I don't
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:05.520]   know, it was fun. And you'll hear people's stories about like I made my first 11 cents on AdSense
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:12.320]   through my blog. It's these little things but it's fun to work on and see what can happen.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:18.880]   Alright, I was hoping you would even mention your example of you. I think of photography as one of
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:30.240]   those great examples. If you think about how to be a professional photographer at the high end
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.320]   and you think about, "Well, I got to get a studio set up. I've got to have a portrait studio. I've
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.720]   got to create all these contexts." It's a little bit overwhelming. But if you just start taking
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:44.080]   pictures of your kids and posting them on Facebook and on your Instagram feed, over time a couple of
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.920]   your friends might say, "Man, you take some great pictures." And I've talked with even my wife and
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:55.920]   taking pictures of our family. I'm not so inclined to say, "Let me call up Joe's Professional
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.320]   Photography Studio down the road and set up a session." I'm a little intimidated by how...
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.280]   I'm a little intimidated, frankly, by Joe and by his prices. I don't really want to pay a thousand
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.960]   bucks for an afternoon's photography session. I don't know how much Joe charges but I'm less
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:20.640]   likely to actually go and hire him. But if I see my friend Katie, she always is posting great
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.040]   pictures of her kids and she has a real knack for getting the kid to actually smile and look at the
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.720]   camera. Then I might call Katie up and say, "Listen, would you be willing to do a photo
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.720]   shoot with my wife and I and we'll pay you some money?" Well, Katie could very easily make several
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:42.160]   hundred dollars plus on a Saturday afternoon's work down at the beach taking some pictures.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:48.320]   That's much more empowering because now she's earning profit, not wages. And she's not time
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.560]   bound where, "Okay, I'm going to go and wait tables this certain amount. I'm going to make
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:58.000]   $13 an hour after tips." Rather, it's, "I'm going to build this skill and then I'm going to sell
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:06.160]   this skill." And that's frankly how my wife and I, we hired the friend of ours who photographed
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:11.360]   our wedding. We just liked her pictures. We didn't want a big professional outfit of a big fancy
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:16.320]   thing. We just wanted someone to take some nice pictures and she was able to do it. And it's her
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.520]   part-time thing but as her skills have grown, she's certainly earned plenty of money on the side.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.600]   And these things can be integrated together. So whether it's a little bit of photography,
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.920]   maybe you have a skill of being able to help somebody write a resume and you market that
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:35.520]   among your friends. And when somebody's looking for a new job and you can market either among
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.640]   your friends or again externally, somebody's looking for a new job, they pay you 200 bucks
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.880]   for a resume review. And you can tweak their resume and you get pretty good at it. And there's
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:51.440]   a little idea or people who are fitness fanatics and they just start their own boot camp. And
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.920]   they're not trying to build a whole school but they have a few people that like having someone
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.240]   who's going to show up and hold them accountable and they do their workouts on the beach.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:06.160]   Or whatever it is. And maybe some of these things can be integrated. So I think of somebody who's,
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:12.400]   for example, a real estate agent. Well, the income may fluctuate. You can list some houses
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.320]   here and there. But a couple houses every couple of months with some of these side gigs, now you've
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.840]   got a pretty nice living in a flexible manner. And you're thinking about what services can I
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:30.640]   bring to the marketplace instead of who's going to give me a job. Cottage industries. Have you
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.600]   talked about cottage industries on your show at all? Have any interesting examples?
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.560]   What do you mean by that? So what I mean is, for example, someone who's making baking bread
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.320]   and selling it or making candles, making handicrafts, things like that, selling them
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   on Etsy, selling them locally, those types of actual physical products for niche, crafty type
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:57.360]   of things. I've talked with one Etsy seller and what I learned from that conversation was it
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:03.680]   doesn't actually at all have to be handmade. So she was selling digital financial planners,
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.480]   actually. And it's like, "Hey, I just created this template, upload a PDF file,
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:14.080]   and then you're good to go." So you don't have to be in your backyard whittling things or
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.280]   making jewelry or something like that, although you certainly could, to take advantage of some
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.960]   of these marketplaces. So a little bit more... Because my friend was selling blankets on Etsy
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.040]   for a while. And it's like, "You've got to charge a ridiculous amount of money to make this
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.080]   worthwhile." This is an $80 blanket now based on how much time it took me to find the materials
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.480]   and quilt it and do all this stuff. And it's like, "I can get the same or I can get the thing at
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:45.200]   Target for $5." And so that's a tough sell. But when it's something repeatable, when it's a digital
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:53.040]   thing, that's when I like the idea of Etsy. I think that there are some real opportunities in
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.480]   things like this. I don't know anything about selling arts and crafts, but there's a story I've
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.200]   been wanting to mention on the show and I'll go ahead and mention. I have a friend who is involved
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:07.520]   in the bee business. And he just has this little part-time hobby of keeping some hives of bees.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:14.000]   But when he started telling me the numbers of the amount of money that he makes with his hives of
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:22.400]   bees, it's stunning to me how profitable this little side cottage business is. And with bees,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.640]   the way that business works is you rent these hives of bees out to a farmer in order for them
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.440]   to pollinate their fields and you sell the honey. And it's farming. You've got to care for your
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.560]   animals, your bees, and you've got to make sure that they're healthy and there's a learning curve
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:44.800]   to it. But there's a relatively low barrier to entry. But the opportunity to buy honey that's
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:51.840]   local honey, that's probably pretty close to organic, or it's at least high quality and you
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:57.360]   know it hasn't been diluted with a bunch of syrups and sugar that's just been poured into it that
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.000]   you're getting at the grocery store. It commands a very high premium for raw, unfiltered, local
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.080]   honey. And just this total tiny little niche market with stunning profit potential, not
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.440]   necessarily that you're going to go and compete with the guys who are running hundreds of thousands
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.320]   of hives, but just on this very small scale in a local marketing effort. And I think there are a
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:24.240]   ton of these kinds of ideas that can be developed on the side, whether it's some farming venture,
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.840]   some handicraft, something like that, that with the ability to market, we should be paying more
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.120]   attention to how can I create a business rather than how can I go get a job, which is I think the
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:42.640]   essence of side hustling. It is. It's something that we, in college I ran a painting business,
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.800]   actually it was through one of the national companies, but they say, "Here's your territory,
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.520]   go out and paint as many houses as you can." And you just go out and had to hustle door to
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.680]   door to find business. And then the second year we got a little bit smarter and we set up a booth
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.480]   at the home show, we signed up a ton of leads and go out and do their estimates, say, "Hey,
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   let's get this done." So yeah, I like your point on working for profits, not wages.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.680]   I was a Jim Rohn quote, "Profits are better than wages. Wages will make you a living,
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.040]   profits will make you a fortune."
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.880]   Oh, okay. I like it.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:21.680]   It's a well articulated quote. Well, Nick, this has been fun. I'd love for people, I mean,
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.720]   you've got a whole podcast, you've got a blog, you've got a whole site dedicated to this. I
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.040]   don't want to obviously try to rehash everything, but I wanted to give people some ideas because
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:34.400]   many times when you're thinking about earning extra income, immediately we go to, "I need to
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.080]   work extra." And that might have a place. For example, if your career is one where extra work
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.600]   can pay off, then you should probably think about that. If your career is one where there's a high
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:51.200]   degree of potential advancement, then you should, I think, primarily be focused on using your extra
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:48:00.000]   time to build your skill to reach at least the top 20% or the top 4 or 5% in your career because
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.760]   there's a lot of growth potential for many of us. But for many people, their careers are relatively,
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:12.080]   they're not dead end, but they're capped. They're not going to go above a certain amount that
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:17.280]   they're making and working a ton of extra hours is not going to measurably impact that.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:22.720]   So in that situation, I think one of the ideas should be to pursue some sort of entrepreneurial
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.120]   side activity. And so for those who are interested in that, I'd commend your site,
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:33.600]   SiteHustleNation. Your podcast can be a useful way to just expand the creative juices of the
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.480]   different opportunities that are available to us. We live in an exciting time in which the
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:44.800]   individual can reach other individuals with valuable products and services more easily than
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:50.320]   it's ever been in the history of the world. Nick, is there a place that you would encourage people
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.560]   to start, some resources that you've developed, certain episodes of your show? How would you want
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.080]   people to start with your content if they come over and check out what you're doing?
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.520]   Well, on the podcast side, if you're in audio format, there's a different
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:09.360]   part-time business idea every week on the SiteHustle show. So you can search for that.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:14.240]   And if you go to SiteHustleNation.com/ideas, there's a whole laundry list of different
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:19.520]   ideas to get the creative juices flowing for you. I might get started. What were the dog sites you
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:25.680]   said? Rover.com, what was the other one? The dog sit-in site? Dog Vacay. Dog Vacay. I might start
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:31.600]   doing that. I've got a big yard. I could handle the dogs. That might be one that we might have
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.240]   to check out. Perfect. Nick, thanks so much for coming on today. I really appreciate it.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:42.560]   You bet. We'll talk to you soon. I hope you found that content to be useful to you.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.000]   That's my major goal is to bring you ideas that are useful. Nick's really a great guy. I found
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.480]   him to be just so unassuming and just a real pleasure to be with even though we only spent
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:59.600]   a brief amount of time together when we met. But his site really is a neat wealth of resources and
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.880]   information for you. And so get on over and check it out. It's at SiteHustleNation.com.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.960]   You can find Nick's story. You can join his tribe. You can find out some of the
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.720]   information that he's published. He's got a lot of really great information over there. And he's
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:18.000]   really building a really neat community of people. And from everything that I can tell,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.480]   seems to be very straightforward and just doing a good job of giving great information.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.440]   That's it for today's show. I thank you so much for being here. This week, I'm going to be bringing
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:33.280]   you a couple of things. I'm going to be digging into some detailed shows on qualified tuition
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:38.160]   programs, aka 529 plans. I'm going to give you everything that you need to know about that.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.440]   I might do a little bit of tax stuff. I'm thinking about doing a show on mortgage credit
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.920]   certificates this week. Maybe it'll be this week or next week. I'm still working out the timing to
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:51.840]   see how many shows the 529 plan is going to be. But it's going to be a good week on the show.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:58.720]   I've been doing some market research with members of the irregular program, and that's been helping
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:04.160]   to guide the course of the show. I'm finding that there's a lot of interest in investment topics
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:08.960]   and retirement topics. So I'm going to be bringing more content on that.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.640]   It's starting to get a clearer vision of what I'm doing. I just want to thank you guys for
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.760]   the support and thank you so much for listening. If you would like to support the show, please
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:23.200]   consider joining the membership program. I'm in the process of transforming things,
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:28.000]   but put it this way. I don't plan to run a lot of sales, but the membership program is dramatically
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.520]   on sale at the moment for what the benefits are going to be. It's going to be kept on sale for
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.800]   those members who have supported it when there's really nothing there, which there's still nothing
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.600]   there. But if you want to support the show, head on over to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/membership,
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.000]   and you can find all the information on that and some new methods of supporting the show coming
