[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Cal Newport here. This is my fourth weekly update videos.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.680]   These are the videos where I give you a look inside my life as a professional
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.240]   writer, professor, and podcaster and talk about my struggles to work deeply in an
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.760]   increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.920]   Today I want to talk about reading. So in episode 220 of my podcast, which came out
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.320]   on Monday, I casually mentioned in response to a listener's question that
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.280]   in the last four days I had bought four new books which I plan to all finish in
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.020]   the next four weeks. This raised the natural follow-up question of well how
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.280]   do I actually structure my reading? How do I get all of these books actually
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.240]   consumed given all the other things that are going on in my life? So that's what I
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.800]   want to talk about in today's video. I'm going to break my reading into three
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.720]   categories. Books I read for writing or professional projects, books I read for
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.240]   just my own interest, and non-book media, so sort of miscellaneous media that I
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.200]   also consume. I'll talk about my strategies for all three. I then want to
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.880]   take you on location, so stick with me in this video. I want to take you on location
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.120]   to the very newest reading location in my life. You will hear about this more in
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.160]   a second, but I just had a natural gas fireplace installed in my house so that
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.080]   I could sit by a fire to read in the evening. I'll take you there and show
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.000]   that to you a little bit later in the video. Alright, so let's talk about the
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.440]   first type of reading I do, which is books that are relevant for research. So
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.080]   I need it for something I'm writing, for example. Typically my strategy with those
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.560]   is a one chapter a day baseline. So typically first thing in the morning, if
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.040]   I'm busy, maybe a little bit later in the day, but it's just my baseline. When am I
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.280]   going to get in my pages? Right now, for example, I just started reading Nick
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.840]   Bostrom's Superintelligence. I need this for an article I'm writing. It's about
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.360]   300 pages long, 15 chapters more or less. Starting today I'm doing a one chapter a
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.240]   day baseline. I read my chapter this morning in the morning before I even
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.760]   took my kids to school. That's what I'm going to try to do most days that I'm up
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.880]   in time, and if not I'll grab the time a little later. What I then add in, because
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.040]   that's a reasonable baseline, but that's going to take me 15 days to finish
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.880]   that book, I then add in for these professional focus books, these books
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.400]   relevant to my professional life, extra sessions here and there. These will go
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.560]   right into my time block plan for the day. So maybe on Wednesday I'll put aside
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.240]   an hour after lunch, or maybe on Friday morning I'll put aside the time between
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.480]   two different meetings, and I'll have time block sessions just for reading. If
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   you put aside a half hour or an hour in the middle of your workday, you're
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.880]   already in time block mode, you can blow through three, four chapters no problem.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.600]   So now we put this together and you see how I'll finish this book relatively soon.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.760]   I'm reading a chapter a day, if I do three sessions that's probably seven or
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.560]   eight chapters easy. So now one week of background reading with two or three
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.640]   time block sessions, each of them less than an hour, that book is done. So that's
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.800]   how I tackle my professional interest books. For books that I buy just for my
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.440]   own interest, so for example the book I bought this morning was John Meacham's
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.720]   new biography of Abraham Lincoln. I'll always get out of bed for a new Lincoln
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.800]   biography. I have a long bibliographic relationship with Lincoln. I'm really
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.440]   excited for this new one. There I have an opposite rhythm. The default reading of
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.440]   whatever non-commercial book I'm reading at the time, so a book just for my own
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.040]   interest, is at night. When I get in bed I read every night in bed. And so I do not
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.440]   want a book that has anything to do with any professional project before bed
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.040]   that's going to turn back on work mode, that's going to undo all of the
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   advantage I get from doing a shutdown ritual. So I always want a book to read
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.920]   at night that is unrelated to my work. So that Lincoln book for example, I'll start
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.320]   reading that every night and that becomes my baseline. At the end of the day I have
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.280]   that baseline of reading. For these personal interest books I then add in
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.720]   other reading sessions, ad hoc reading sessions, as my schedule allows. I like
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.320]   reading to feel as a high priority default leisure activity when I don't
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.280]   have something to do. So there's a lot of different locations or settings in which
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.880]   I'll integrate this ad hoc reading sessions for my personal books. I made a
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.760]   list of it. My front porch, when the weather is nice I associate my front
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.160]   porch with an outdoor couch. I'll read there in the afternoon before dinner
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.400]   while the kids are running around and being crazy. There was a field I can
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.880]   reach with my morning walks. I was really big on this during the pandemic in
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.360]   particular. I would walk to that field and I would read under a pine tree there.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.760]   Reading with lunch is a big thing for me with personal interest books. Get a good
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.880]   meal, get that book. 20 minutes, there's a chapter or two read right there. My study at
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.760]   home, I like to read in my study at home. This is where I just had installed a new
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.040]   gas fireplace looking ahead to the cold weather season it just started so that
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.720]   I'd be more tempted to do evening. We're talking after dinner writing sessions
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.120]   because I could have a nice crackling fire. I'm actually going to show you this
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.640]   fire in just a couple minutes so stick with me. That's how I do my
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.640]   personal interest reading. Rhythm at the night, ad hoc sessions in interesting
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.960]   locations occasionally throughout the day. That Lincoln book is about 400 pages.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.160]   It'll probably take me about two weeks at this background to get that done but
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   that's exactly how I'll be doing it. For both commercial and personal interest
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.920]   books or professional and personal interest books, I do one at a time in
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.480]   each of those categories. I'll finish my professional interest book at the
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.680]   moment before I move on to the next. I will finish superintelligence before I
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.520]   move on to whatever's next. I'll finish that Lincoln book before I move over to
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.480]   whatever personal interest book is next. I do it sequential. You have a sort of
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.720]   race to the finish line to get it done and then you switch on to what's next.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:54.640]   Finally, non book related reading. As long-time listeners of my podcast or
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.040]   readers of my book know, I don't use social media. I don't consume a lot of
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.200]   online news. When I see that glowing computer screen and think about going
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.160]   over there to get information, I see time that I could be spending doing
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.080]   intentional deep things just being sucked out of my head. I'm very
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.360]   suspicious of that. So my non book reading is largely confined to physical
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.520]   printed things. I get the Washington Post delivered to my house every morning
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.640]   because I live in Washington DC and I will skim that each morning over
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.120]   breakfast. I'll look at the front page and I'll look at the metro section. The
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.680]   metro section so I can see local news of relevance. The front page will let me
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.360]   know what's going on in national news. I'll look at the sports page if the
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.680]   Nationals had a game and I want to see how the coverage is and that's about it.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.560]   Maybe I'll read one or two articles per day. A couple things that seem
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.120]   interesting. Tell you what, that keeps me completely up to date as far as I'm
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.800]   concerned with what's happening in the world. That keeps me pretty up to date
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.340]   with interesting stuff happening in my region. No Twitter needed. I'm also as you
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:05.520]   might imagine a longtime subscriber of the New Yorker. My New Yorker magazine
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.400]   policy is always at least one article per magazine. So when the new magazine
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.360]   comes I always take out at least one article that seems interesting. I'll
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.940]   usually read it when I get home from work and I see it there. I'll find an
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.040]   article. I'll just read it. It takes 15 minutes but at least one article per
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.080]   magazine. That's always my rule. As I tell people you need an exception to that
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.920]   rule which is if there's ever a Cal Newport piece whether it's in the
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.940]   magazine or NewYorker.com that you always have to read. So let's just make that the
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.800]   baseline. And that's my reading. So that works out to about five books a month. I
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.280]   actually go through the books I read on my podcast each each month. So if you
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.480]   don't follow the Deep Questions podcast you should. You can get some more details
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.400]   there. That's why I keep up with the news. That's why I keep up with the
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.280]   interesting writing. It's not as much time as you think. It's much more about
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.800]   the regularity of it. Every day there's multiple different reading sessions
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.840]   going on even if they're short. That adds up to a lot of reading, a lot of
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.400]   intellectual stimulation, a lot of new information to try to structure into
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.960]   your understanding of yourself and your world. It's fuel for ideas. It's fuel for
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:20.000]   self-reflection. It's fuel for growth. It's fuel for creativity, hard ideas, print
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.800]   words tackled on the page day after day. It's worth it and that's how I do it.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.240]   Alright I want to take you now we're going to jump over and I want to show
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.960]   you that brand new, the newest location in my secret reading location
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.880]   repertoire, my new crackling fire in my study. So let's go see that. Alright as
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.160]   promised here I am in my study at my house and I wanted to show you the
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   latest feature that I had installed specifically to help induce me to get
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:57.040]   more reading done and that is this gas fireplace right here. I can turn this off
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.880]   and on with the press of a remote. It was a pain. We had to replace our meter. We
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.040]   had to retile this whole thing but it was worth it because I'm thinking ahead
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.480]   to those cold winter nights when all you want to do is stay warm and I think
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.320]   being in this study having it be dark, just my reading lamp on and a few of
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.960]   the library lights and hearing the crackling fire means I'm more likely to
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.160]   read and the more reading the better. We'll do a tour of this whole study in a
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.640]   later video but for now as promised I wanted to show off this latest feature
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:33.000]   that I added. Alright so that's it for this week's update video. We'll be back
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:43.480]   next week with my next update video and I will see you then.
