[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Do you believe in optimal levels of arousal for different aspects of practice or game?
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.760]   Autonomic arousal is something I've worked on for many years and one of the most impressive
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.960]   features I think of our brains as humans.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.600]   First would be our ability to think into the past, present, or future or combination of
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.640]   those two.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.360]   If other animals do that, they don't do it nearly as well and they certainly don't create
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.800]   technologies to bridge those different time scales.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   That's number one.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920]   But the other one is our visual and temporal aperture of focus.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.440]   So when we are in a state of elevated arousal, our visual aperture shrinks, I'm sure you're
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.800]   familiar with this, and we slice time more finely, much, you know, it's like a higher
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   frame rate.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   Right.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.660]   Which is why people who, for instance, see a devastating traumatic car crash report experiencing
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.200]   things in slow motion, right, because their frame rate is high, like a slow motion video.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.040]   Whereas when we are relaxed, our frame rate is larger bins of time.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.680]   And I feel like so much of the discussion around things like flow and optimal states
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.920]   for learning have to do with assuming that there's one optimal state of arousal.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.200]   But I feel like in every endeavor I've ever been involved in, it's about learning the
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   transitions between the arousal states that allows us to, you know, pull back a little
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.440]   bit as things, as you said, like get tense, just relax just a little bit to be able to
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.680]   maybe see a different perspective or ratchet up our level of tension or AKA arousal in
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.580]   order to be able to fine slice the, you know, the micro expressions of a competitor.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.400]   I mean, these two cameras on the fronts of our skull and the rest of our brain are really
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.200]   devoted to this process of, you know, shrinking or expanding the aperture of our consciousness.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.680]   And it can be talked about in terms of space, just vision, like tunnel vision versus panoramic
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   vision.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.960]   It can be talked about at space time, you know, tunnel vision, fine slice, panoramic
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.640]   vision, broader slice.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.080]   But then when you start getting into like the, then you map that onto the past, present
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.960]   and future mapping, and that's where I feel like we're into the game of skill learning
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.640]   and chess and strategy.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.680]   So forgive me for the kind of, you know, top contour neuroscience description, but that's
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.200]   how I see the human primate as so different than all the other creatures in the world.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.120]   That's how we're different because we can learn chess or ballet, foil, you know, Gibbons
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.240]   are pretty amazing at what Gibbons do.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   But if they're trying to learn other stuff that they've been failing so far.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.480]   I spent a lot of time playing with frame rates.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.520]   And I had this experience that I wrote about in that slowing down time chapter of The Art
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.600]   of Learning where I, when I had these experiences both in chess and in fighting, one time I
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.960]   was fighting against a super heavyweight dude in a competition and my hand shattered.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.600]   And like I broke my hand right here.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.760]   And it was interesting because the fight was very intense, reasonably hard, and my hand
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.160]   broke and instantly time slowed down.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.260]   And he was moving in slow motion.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.580]   And I was able to just so easily play with someone with like a broken hand compared to
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.980]   what had been a war before.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.980]   - We know what that is.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.980]   - Right, we do know what that is.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.980]   - That's adrenaline.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.980]   - Adrenaline.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.980]   - Yeah.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.680]   - Adrenaline and that tunnel vision, and then the frames are fat.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.240]   - I mean, if I inject you with just a little bit of adrenaline, it stays in your periphery,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.500]   but it activates systems in your brain in parallel to that.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.840]   And you're gonna experience an immediate dilation of your pupils.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   You'll have more tunnel vision.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.600]   I mean, every process is sped up in the direction of higher frame rate.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.560]   - So then the question then became for me, and this would be fun to talk, I've never
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   spoken to a scientist about this process.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.000]   Like how do I learn to do that at will, right?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.160]   And then how can I train, 'cause I can't just pump myself with adrenaline all the time,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.480]   although maybe I can learn to have that physiological response.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   - You can deploy it.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.080]   - Right, so then how can I deploy it, right?
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.200]   What are triggers for having that chemical change?
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:27.020]   And then also, how can I train so that I have the experience of more frames than my opponent?
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.280]   And so Marcelo Garcia, he's known as the king of the scramble, he spends his whole time
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   in transition.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.960]   So if you're training jujitsu with most people, they're always finding a position and holding
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   it.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.320]   And so Marcelo, one of the unique things about his training life for most of his life was
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.920]   that he never held positions.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.920]   He was always moving.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.320]   He was always in the in between.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.960]   And it's true in most arts is that people think that the art is the positions that they
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.120]   see, but the real high level art is the space in between the positions.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.600]   So if we have this position leads to this position, that's gonna be like, there's gonna
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.420]   be no frames in between for most people.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.360]   For some people, there might be four frames.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.160]   But if I have 100 frames, then I can play in pockets that you don't see.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.900]   And so if you're living your life in the training process in the in between, in the transition,
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.280]   if you're always, the way that manifests in actual, like, for example, jujitsu training
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.580]   or submission grappling training is if you're not holding positions, you're always moving
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.760]   and you're spending all of your time in the in between, while people who are holding position
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.960]   are always static.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.380]   So if you go to a jujitsu school and you sit and watch, it's interesting to look for this
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.880]   one thing.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.080]   Notice the amount of time static versus in motion.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080]   Marcelo was always in motion.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.320]   There's a beautiful clip of him that you got people can look up.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   It's an art de suave.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.740]   It was an old documentary back in the day, like 25 years ago, I think it was.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.740]   It's on YouTube.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.480]   It's like an eight minute clip of him training as an, I think, an 18 year old.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.000]   And you watch him just like in the early days of him learning this transitional approach,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.200]   and he's just never stopping.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.720]   He's always allowing the person, but you have to get past the egoic dynamics.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.540]   Because you can't, you're giving up on dominating people all the time.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.960]   Because when you're in a dominant position in jujitsu, you want to hold it because you've
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   won.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.520]   You don't want this bullshit passing between men who are fighting, or women who are fighting
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   each other.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   We want to dominate.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.440]   But if you release that, and you're thinking about the learning process, and you stop holding,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   then you're moving.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.800]   And you're getting nonstop exposure to the in between.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.560]   So if you spend your life training in the in between, then you have more frames than
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   other people do.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.360]   That's a lot of what illusionists are doing.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.620]   They spend all of their time training in the spaces that other people don't look at.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.780]   And so it's not magic.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.980]   It's brilliant training.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.460]   It's the art of illusion at the in between.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.220]   And a lot of the things that you can do, a high-level martial artist can do to a lower-level
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.300]   martial artist, or someone who doesn't train, that feels mystical.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.620]   It's all about that principle manifest in interesting ways.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.920]   And in general, for me, and this goes back to the question you asked two or three brilliant
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.140]   expansive questions ago around intense moments.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:02.240]   A lot of what my training has been is having some serendipitous intense moment, and then
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.880]   learning, and then it becomes a beacon.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:11.020]   So for example, there was a moment I was playing in a world chess championship in Calicut,
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.020]   India.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.360]   And I was deep into a calculation, couldn't find the solution, and there was an earthquake.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.660]   And everything started, like, in the actual world, everything started shaking, right?
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.600]   But I experienced the earthquake from the inside of the chess position.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.860]   And I knew there was an earthquake, but I also was lost.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.300]   My brain was lost in the labyrinth.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.500]   And I found the solution.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.460]   And then I got up and left, vacated, because we had to leave the playing hall.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.220]   Then we came back, and I made my move and went on to win.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.460]   And it was so interesting, because it was like, and then the earthquake, like, and a
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.100]   lot of what happens in chess is that you're reaching so deep into the complexity, like,
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.460]   into the cupboard, but the solution is right here at the front, and all you have to do
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.460]   is come back out and surface.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.500]   One of the best ways, by the way, to prevent, to minimize chess blunders with, like, talented
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:06.180]   young players or players of any level, any age, is to shift the order of decide, make
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:11.880]   the move, and then write it down, because you notate your chess games, to decide, write
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.740]   it down, and then make the move.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.580]   Write it down is a resurfacing, and you have common sense, look at the position.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.780]   Almost all chess blunders, you realize you blundered instantly.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.740]   You can think for 20 minutes, make your move, you know instantly you blundered, because
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.220]   there's not that surfacing, right?
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.580]   But then you can learn to just do the surfacing before making the actual move.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.780]   It's true with human decision making in general.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.660]   Right, we realize that the screw up right as we complete it.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.500]   Yeah, because, like, we're caught up in all of our bullshit, we make the move, and then
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.180]   we've left our thought process, and like, oh, that was just absurd, right?
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.180]   And we see it.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.180]   I mean, you think about, I mean, you think about the heartbreaking literature, you know,
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.020]   studies in how people who have jumped off a bridge relate to at the moment after they've
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.820]   jumped off the bridge, those who have survived, right, the interviews afterwards.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.180]   Yeah, they report wishing they hadn't jumped.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.180]   Right.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.180]   Immediately.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.180]   Like, they jump, and then they wish they hadn't jumped.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.180]   Such an important message.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.820]   You know, we hear all this stuff about suicide prevention, and, you know, but just that knowledge.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.340]   I mean, I don't know how conscious of that sort of thing people are as they're headed
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.340]   down the trench.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:20.020]   I mean, what, of suicidal depression, but these apertures that we're talking about,
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.900]   these time-space apertures where frame rate is set and visual aperture is set, I think
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.340]   for most people, we experience them as sort of notches.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.500]   So it's like, you know, you're in a high state of arousal, and you have high frame rate,
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.000]   you know, and then, and just like being like a ball bearing down in a trench, you can't
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.180]   really see out the other side.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.660]   You're literally in there at a certain frame rate of, let's say, an argument, an intense
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.300]   argument with somebody where you want to win, and you're frustrated with them, and the whole
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.220]   situation, and you're in the trench.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.100]   Whereas when you're relaxed, it's more, you know, a broad concave or a flat table where
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.620]   the ball bearing can move around at will.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.900]   It sounds like Marcello and people that train these different transition states is you're
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:08.100]   really learning to access the different frame rates, but from a place of like, kind of like
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.880]   a little dimple in a table, and then being able to move to the next one as a dimple and
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.500]   kind of moving from dimple to dimple as opposed to like these trenches of brain states.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.980]   And I think that, I think about this a lot, a lot, because I feel like most bad decisions
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.140]   are made from a high frame rate, high arousal state.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.720]   Most of the terrible things that humans have done to one another, you know, I suppose their
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.580]   sociopathy and like, you know, preplanned things, but they tend to be associated with
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:45.060]   high arousal states where people regret what they did, all second degree murder, for instance.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.300]   In any event, I think the ability to move through these different arousal states at
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.380]   will is possible.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.580]   You asked earlier, like, how would one do that?
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.860]   Well, the beautiful thing about the visual system in these different frame rates and
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.780]   states of arousal is that it works in both directions.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.740]   So when you're in a higher state of arousal, your visual aperture shrinks, you go to a
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.340]   higher frame rate.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.540]   But it's also true that if you shrink your visual aperture, you go to a higher frame
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.540]   rate.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.540]   The converse is also true.
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.820]   If you deliberately, for instance, as we're looking across one another right now, if I
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.780]   start to take in the fullness of the picture here, the walls, et cetera, there's a natural
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.440]   relaxation of the autonomic arousal systems or parasympathetic activity goes up.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   And what's incredible is that any time we view a horizon, that naturally happens because
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.000]   you're not setting to a single fixation point.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.580]   So anytime you see a horizon, you relax and it's not a coincidence.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.820]   So the visual system can drive it inward and your autonomic arousal can drive it toward
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.940]   your visual system.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.020]   The other thing is there's a really beautiful paper that came out about two years ago which
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.480]   showed that people who do a biofeedback game where they're watching a little, you know,
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.520]   it's like a more kind of like a sine wave and they're deliberately trying to increase
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:06.480]   their level of arousal as the curve goes up for those that are just listening.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:13.440]   Within a few days, they can learn to control their pupil size, which sets their arousal
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.740]   and their aperture for a segmenting time.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.640]   So you can learn this through biofeedback.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.840]   And I think that the script for that is available online.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.940]   I haven't tried it yet, but if you ever heard of these yogis that could control their pupil
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.680]   sizes even independently of one another, that's amazing because it's not supposed to be able
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.800]   to occur, but you can.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.200]   So you can learn to, you know, I guess the poor man's version of this would be look in
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.960]   the mirror, stare at yourself and try and ramp up your level of autonomic arousal, watch
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.920]   your pupils get bigger, and then try and relax yourself and make them smaller.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.600]   That practice it seems in biofeedback allows people to do it without staring into the mirror,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.760]   so to speak.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.520]   So it can be done.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:13:03.120]   It's just that it hasn't been parsed by science that finely until recently.
