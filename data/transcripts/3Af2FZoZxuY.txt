[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   As I have just reminded you, we are resuming our studies of the Epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   and we are doing so in chapter 7 and at verse 7. Nothing is so dangerous when you are reading
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:25.200]   or interpreting Scripture as to take us out of its context. I find more and more that
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.840]   the secret of understanding the message of the Scripture, one of the most important secrets,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.080]   is to understand the context. The context will give a meaning when the knowledge of
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.440]   the Greek or the Hebrew very often doesn't do so. It is altogether more important than
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.520]   linguistics. And therefore, it is important that we should realize exactly the setting.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.640]   Now if that is true as a universal principle, it is particularly true in the exposition
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.080]   of this seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. As most of you realize, probably,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.680]   it is a chapter concerning which there has been a great deal of discussion and argumentation
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.280]   and disputation, and a great deal of disagreement. The history of the interpretation of this
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.840]   chapter, and especially at the point at which we are resuming this evening and from here
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.480]   to the end, is a most interesting and fascinating one. And, as I have already been suggesting—I
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.000]   am reminding you of this—I believe that a lot of the disagreement has been due solely
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.400]   to the fact that so many have not troubled to be guided by the context, but have just
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.160]   come to the chapter in and of itself, and in doing so have gone astray. Very well, then.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.440]   I would remind you once more of the whole setting. And to do this, I must go back to
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.800]   the end of chapter 5. The key, as I am never tired of repeating, to the understanding of
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.960]   chapter 6 and 7 of the Epistle to the Romans is chapter 5. And if we are not clear about
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.000]   chapter 5, we can't possibly understand chapter 6 and 7. I am suggesting that chapter
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.520]   6 and 7 of this great epistle are parentheses—one big parenthesis, if you like, subdivided
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   into two subsidiary sections, chapter 6 being one, chapter 7 being the other. Why did the
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.160]   apostle indulge in this parenthesis? Well, he did so because of what he had been saying
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.480]   at the end of chapter 5, especially in verses 20 and 21, where he says, "Moreover, the
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.760]   law entered that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did much more
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.400]   abound, that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.280]   unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord." Now, it is that twentieth verse that really
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.680]   gives us the key. The apostle, having been describing how the Christian believer is in
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.280]   Christ—he was in Adam, he is now in Christ—and what is bound to happen to him because he
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.720]   is in Christ, suddenly realizes that many people might say, "But surely all this is
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.040]   to put the law on one side." And not only that, putting the law on one side means that
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.600]   there will be no standard or canon for conduct and for behavior. The thing that has always
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.440]   guaranteed holiness has been the law. But here is a man who seems to brush the law aside.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.000]   Therefore, there is no hope for holy living. And therefore, he takes this difficulty up.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.400]   Now, in chapter 6, as we saw at length, he takes up this moral question. He deals with
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.000]   it in terms of, "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?" and proves that
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.600]   that is an utterly monstrous suggestion. That all the gospel everywhere shows clearly that
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:15.320]   it is designed to produce sanctification and holiness. Now, that is what he does in chapter
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:24.880]   6 in particular. But now, in chapter 7, he comes on to deal with that other question,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.280]   namely the question about the law. He had to deal with this, obviously. He has just
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.080]   made that remark in chapter 5, verse 20, "The law came in by the side," as it were. You
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.160]   remember, that's the meaning of that word "entered." It's something that came in on
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.840]   the side. It isn't in the center. It's something that's come in from the side somewhere.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.640]   Well, now, people would jump at that at once and say, "Do you speak like that about the
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.560]   law, the law of God that was given to Moses? How can you say that?" And then, of course,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.880]   in chapter 6, in verse 14, he had made a statement like this. He said, "For sin shall not have
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.440]   dominion over you because, for you are not under the law, but under grace." And he seems
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:20.480]   to rejoice in the fact that they are not under law. Now, then, he realizes at once that there
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.400]   were people who would take those two statements and so interpret them as to say that the apostle,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.440]   lastly, had no use at all for the law, that he's dismissing it, that he's very glad that
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:41.720]   he can do so. The law, according to this teaching, seems to have a superficial appearance of
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.040]   being valueless and countless. And, at the same time, as I say, he seems to be setting
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.360]   on one side the one thing that guarantees and promotes holiness of life. Very well,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.840]   now, that's the thing which he takes up in this seventh chapter. It is the chapter of
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:11.400]   all chapters about the law and the relationship of the Christian to the law. There is nothing
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.620]   that is more important for us than that we should be clear as to this particular relationship.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.120]   And he expounds it in the body of this chapter. If you like, we can put it in another way.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:34.440]   We can say that the object of this seventh chapter of this epistle is to show that sanctification
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:44.160]   by the law is as impossible as was justification by the law. Now, he spent the first four chapters
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.080]   proving that, that no man can be justified by the deeds of the law. He is now equally
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:59.720]   concerned to show that no man can be sanctified by the law and by being under the law. Now,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.280]   that's the general theme. But he divides it up into three main sections. The first
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.560]   is verses 1 to 6, the one we've already dealt with. That was just a general statement
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:21.760]   to show us our relationship to the law and to show that as Christians we are in an entirely
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:29.280]   new relationship to the law. He uses the illustration of marriage. We were once married to the law;
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.840]   we are no longer in that position. We have become dead to the law, so the relationship
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:41.200]   has been broken. And therefore, being broken from that relationship, we can marry this
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.480]   mother, the Lord Jesus Christ, the one who has died for us and who has risen again, in
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.160]   order that we may bring forth fruit, bear children, as it were, unto God.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:08:03.240]   Now, that is his first statement in verses 1 to 6. He just makes the statement that a
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:10.200]   Christian is no longer married to the law. He is no longer under the law. But he said
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:18.640]   more than that. He made a second statement. He shows us why that is important, why it
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.960]   is important for us to be freed from the law in that sense. And that is the statement,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.440]   of course, he makes in verse 5. He says, "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:37.520]   sin, the passions of sin, which were aggravated by the law, did work in our members to bring
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.160]   forth fruit unto death." That was our position then, when we were under the law. So it is
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.320]   a good thing that we are no longer under the law, but that we are married to this other.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.400]   But now, he says in verse 6, we are delivered from the law, being dead to that under which
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:04.240]   we were held, in order that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:13.320]   of the letter. Very well, there was the first section. But then, here comes the second section.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:23.360]   Verses 7 to 12. Some would say 13. I wouldn't quarrel with them. This section ends either
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   in verse 12 or 13. Perhaps the best way of putting it is this, that the second section
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:35.960]   runs from verse 7 to verse 12. That verse 13 is a kind of summing up of it all, or a
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.320]   transition point from this section to the next, which starts at verse 14 and goes on
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:47.960]   to the end of the chapter. Now then, what does he do in this second section, verses
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:58.120]   7 to 12? Well, here what he does is to vindicate the law, the law in and of itself, the law
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:07.360]   as such, and to prove that the law must never be held responsible for our failure. Now,
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.920]   I'll explain in a moment why he feels it's necessary to do that. But that is what he
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.760]   does. It is a vindication of the character of the law, and he absolves it completely
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:28.640]   from every charge of being responsible for our failure. That's 7 to 12. Verse 13, as
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.800]   I say, is a kind of summing up of that argument and leading into the next section, 14 to 25.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:44.720]   What is this? Well, here he gives us a demonstration in practice, and from the experimental standpoint,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:54.600]   of what he has been saying in that second section. He felt that this was necessary to
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:03.440]   show how the law can not only not deliver us, but actually aggravates our problem. And
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   he ends off by showing that though the law leaves us in a state of complete hopelessness,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:17.960]   there is nevertheless a hope. We have the triumphant cry, "I thank God through Jesus
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.280]   Christ our Lord." Now, then, there's a kind of bird's-eye view
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:32.360]   of the entire section. Now, let me put it like this. The first section, verses 1 to
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:41.520]   15, really says everything. And what he does in these two further sections is merely to
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.840]   elaborate what he said in the first section. His whole case, as I say, in the first section
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:54.280]   is that we are no longer under the law, and why he rejoices that we are not under the
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:01.080]   law, but under Christ. Now, that's the big statement, that it is because we are not under
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:07.160]   the law, but married and joined to Christ, that we can now serve in newness of the Spirit
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:16.680]   and not in the oldness of the letter. And these two sections, 7 to 12 and 14 to 25,
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:23.040]   are nothing but a working out in detail and a demonstration of that original contention
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.000]   and the defense of it against possible misunderstandings.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.400]   Very well. There, I say, is the connection of what we are now going to consider. And
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.200]   it's very important that we should be clear about this. You see, what the apostle is still
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.720]   doing in an ultimate sense is to establish what he had said in verses 1 and 2 of chapter
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:55.500]   5. "Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:02.240]   Christ, by whom also we have access into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.440]   of the glory of God." The man who is justified is a man who, in a sense, is safe and secure.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.240]   His position is certain. He then states that once more in verse 10 of that fifth chapter,
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.120]   "For if," he says, "when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:28.960]   his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life." The certainty of
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.520]   it all. And again he repeated it in verse 21, "That our sin hath reigned unto death,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:41.000]   even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.760]   It's going to do it, and nothing can stop it. And he says there is nothing more important
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.520]   than that people should be clear that it is entirely in the Lord Jesus Christ. You mustn't
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.040]   bring the law in again. If you do, you're ruining everything. You must be clear about
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:05.360]   the law. So he takes time in this parenthesis to clear up the whole situation and the position
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.280]   of the Christian with regard to his relationship to the law.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:16.000]   Now then, having said that, we can start upon this second section, beginning at verse 7.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.840]   This is how he opens out. What shall we say then? Is the law sin? What's he mean by
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:32.880]   this? Well, you see the connection. He has been making certain statements about the law,
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.400]   and he imagines somebody getting up and saying, "Well, there's only one conclusion to
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:45.200]   draw as the result of what you've been saying, and that is that the law, the law that was
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:52.600]   given by God through Moses, is something evil, is something sinful. It is something bad in
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.760]   and of itself." He imagines this objector saying, "You'd already made two statements
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.040]   which had already disturbed me. You'd already, as it were, insulted the law by saying it
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.560]   only came in on the side, and then you've gloried in the fact that we are not under
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:13.560]   the law but under grace, but you've gone further now. You have said in verse 5, 'When
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:22.800]   we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law, aggravated, in that sense
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:30.160]   produced by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.' Surely,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:37.360]   says somebody, you are saying that the law is sin. The law is the same as sin. You rejoice
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.280]   in the fact that we are not under law in exactly the same way as you rejoice that we are not
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.280]   under sin. Well, therefore, sin and law must be synonymous. There is no difference between
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:54.760]   them. The law is something bad, sinful, harmful, that leads only to our death. Is that the
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.600]   thing that you're saying?" And at once he answers it with his famous formula, translated
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.800]   here in the Orthodox version, "God forbid," which should be better translated, "Far be
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:16.400]   it from our thoughts, let it be unthinkable." It's the kind of thing, he says, that should
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.160]   never enter anybody's mind. He's already, you remember, used the same formula in chapter
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.360]   6 and before that in chapter 3. He said in chapter 6, "Shall we continue in sin that
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:34.480]   grace may abound? God forbid," he says. And here again he says this. Now, this is something
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:40.680]   that no one should ever have thought of. But as there are people who think such a thing,
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:48.640]   "Well," says the apostle, "we must investigate. We must examine this." Because, he says, "If
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:55.000]   you really draw that conclusion from what I've been saying about the law, the fact of
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:03.360]   the matter is that you have completely misunderstood my whole teaching." So he has to produce a
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:10.280]   kind of subsidiary parenthesis again, a parenthesis of a parenthesis, in order to make it plain.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:17.200]   Now you may wonder why I'm laboring this point. I'm doing so for this reason. The
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:24.760]   apostle in this section and the one that follows is going to put it in terms of "I," things
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.040]   that were true of him. And that's the thing that has always led to the argument and the
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.040]   disputation. People think that the whole purpose of this chapter is for Paul to relate his
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.840]   experience. I'm trying to show that it isn't that at all. That the apostle really would
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.400]   never have written what he's written from verse 7 to 25, were it not for the misunderstanding
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.560]   of people of what he said in verses 1 to 6, and what he'd already said at the end of chapter
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:57.320]   5. In other words, the object of this chapter is not for Paul to give his experience, but
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:03.160]   to help to make clear to people what he teaches about the relationship of the Christian to
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:10.040]   the law, and how the law can never sanctify a man any more than it could ever justify
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.240]   him. So he says, "God forbid, it just means that you've misunderstood the entire purpose
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.640]   of my teaching." But he doesn't leave it at a mere general statement like that. He
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:29.040]   says, "Nay, not only is not that right, but on the contrary." That's the force of this
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:36.240]   expression "Nay." "On the contrary," says the apostle, "the position is not merely that
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:43.680]   I'm not teaching that. My teaching really says the very opposite of that."
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.320]   Well now then, let us follow him as he works this out. Why is his teaching the very opposite
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:56.640]   of saying that the law is sin? And here he's got two answers for us. The first is this,
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:07.880]   "I had not known sin, but by the law." Now that's his first statement. "I had not known
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:16.720]   sin, but by the law." What does he mean by that? Well, again, it's essential that we
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:27.680]   should start with a negative, because this, once more, has been and can be misunderstood.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   Obviously the apostle is not saying that he was not aware of the fact of sin. He's not
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:41.720]   saying that he was not aware of the fact that he had sinned and that others had sinned.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:48.120]   He can't mean that, because there are people who are not Christians who are well aware
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.720]   of the fact that certain things are wrong, and they say that certain things are sinful.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:20:02.560]   There is then a kind of general knowledge concerning sin in all sorts and kinds of people.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.800]   And the apostle is therefore not saying, because he couldn't possibly say, that he had no knowledge
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:13.520]   of sin whatsoever apart from the law. No, what he's saying is this, that he was not
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:23.480]   aware of the real nature of sin until the law made it clear to him. He wasn't clear,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:32.840]   he says, as to what sin really consists of or consists in. It is the law, he says, that
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:41.120]   brought me to an understanding of the essential character and nature and meaning of sin.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.920]   Now this is, in many ways, but to repeat what he had said in chapter 3 in verse 20. He says,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.680]   "Therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:21:00.920]   the law is the knowledge of sin." His point there was that the law, far from justifying,
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.880]   can do no more than give us a knowledge of sin. He's saying the same thing here. It
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:17.960]   is the law of God alone that rarely enables anybody to understand the true character and
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:24.320]   nature of sin. Now this is a tremendous proposition. The real
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:33.960]   trouble with everybody who's unregenerate is that such a person doesn't understand
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:40.560]   the truth about sin. They've got their moral codes, they believe that certain things are
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.840]   right and certain things are wrong, but that's not to understand sin. The moment a man understands
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:55.680]   the true nature and character of sin, he becomes troubled about his soul and he seeks for a
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.760]   savior. So that the trouble with people who are not seeking for a savior and for salvation
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:09.280]   is that they don't understand the true nature of sin. And it is the peculiar function of
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:19.200]   the law to bring that out, to show the real character and meaning and nature of sin. And
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:26.600]   that is why, you see, great evangelical preachers three hundred years ago in the time of the
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.800]   Puritans and two hundred years ago people like Whitefield and others, always did what
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:39.840]   they called a preliminary law work. In their preaching of the gospel they generally started
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.800]   with a presentation of the law. They knew perfectly well that a man wouldn't understand
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:51.280]   salvation unless he understood the nature of sin. So they did a preliminary law work.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:59.640]   They expounded the law of God, showing its relevance and by means of it bringing men
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:08.920]   and women to an understanding of what sin really means in the sight of God. Now, nothing
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:15.520]   but the law, says the apostle, does that. Without the law he had no real knowledge of
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:21.720]   sin. I had not known sin. I would never have discovered what it really means were it not
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:27.480]   for the law. Now that's his first statement. But he's got a second statement which illustrates
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:37.240]   the first. I had not known sin but by the law. For, I had not known lust except the
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:46.160]   law had said thou shalt not covet. Now this for here means, if you like, for example,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.920]   as an illustration. I can tell you, says the apostle, I can make plain to you what I mean
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.720]   when I say that apart from the law I would never have known the real character of sin.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:04.800]   For instance, he says, I would never have known the meaning of lust were it not that
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:12.280]   the law had said thou shalt not covet. Now here is a vitally important statement. What
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:23.840]   is the meaning of lust? Lust means coveting, the covet. It means what is later called concupiscence.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.400]   In verse 8, sin taking occasion by the commandment brought in me all manner of concupiscence.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:38.160]   What does it mean? Well, it means desire after anything forbidden. We've got to be careful
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:46.360]   about this word lust. It is actually a word that means in and of itself simply desire,
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:53.960]   a strong desire. You remember our Lord says to the disciples, with desire have I desire
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.840]   to have the supper with you. The word used is the word lust. So the word in and of itself
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.920]   is neutral. But the context will always make it clear as to whether it's to be taken
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:10.520]   in a neutral sense or even in a good sense or in a bad sense. And commonly speaking,
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:19.640]   the word lust is used in that bad or evil sense. It means a desire, a craving for something
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:28.760]   which is forbidden. Now he says, I would never have known what lust means were it not for
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:37.320]   the law which says thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not desire in this way.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.280]   Now what does he mean by the law here? Well, he probably meant in particular, of course,
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:50.480]   the tenth commandment. You remember the ten commandments as they're given to us in the
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.880]   book of Exodus in chapter 20. And there is little doubt but that the apostle was thinking
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:03.800]   particularly of the tenth commandment which reads like this, thou shalt not covet thy
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:10.000]   neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.800]   his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.360]   Now you've noticed many times obviously the difference between the tenth commandment and
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.680]   the others. The others say thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.120]   shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness. Here's the change, thou shalt not
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:42.400]   covet. At once we are introduced to a difference and to a distinction. Now we mustn't overpress
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:52.000]   this point because this idea of coveting must be applied to all the others also.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.040]   But what then does the apostle say? Well, again I think he is saying two separate things.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:09.840]   The first thing he is saying is this. I had not known that lust was sin in and of itself
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.880]   if the law had not taught me that. Now there is a statement, and it was undoubtedly true
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:23.920]   of the apostle, as it was true of all the Pharisees. They thought of sin only in terms
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:33.200]   of external actions. They thought of it solely in terms of deeds. As long as a man didn't
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:40.680]   do the thing, he was not guilty of sin. An evil desire, they said, is not sin. Sin, it
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.840]   only becomes sin when a man does the thing, carries out his desire. But a desire in and
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.480]   of itself is not sinful. Now the apostle is therefore saying in the
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:28:01.080]   first place that he would never have realized that desires, coveting, lusts, evil thoughts
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:09.680]   and imaginations are sin. He would never have known that were it not that the law had taught
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:18.760]   him that. If you like, we can put it like this. This was the great failure of the Jews,
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:26.200]   and especially of the Pharisees. And that is why our Lord was at such great pains to
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:33.320]   bring this point home to them in the Sermon on the Mount. In Matthew's Gospel, chapter
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:41.840]   5, verse 21 to the end of the chapter, our Lord deals with this one great matter. You
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:48.040]   see, here were these Pharisees teaching the people and believing themselves that as long
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.400]   as you didn't actually murder a person, you were not guilty of murder. But our Lord
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:59.600]   goes on to show them that if you say "rack up," if you say about your brother, "thou
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:06.040]   art already guilty of murder in your heart with respect to that person," and he does
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:11.520]   the same with the question of adultery. They said, "As long as I haven't actually committed
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.080]   an act of adultery, I'm not guilty of adultery." "Wait a moment," says Christ, "if you
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.440]   look upon a woman to lust with her, you've committed adultery with her in your heart,
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.600]   you're guilty of adultery." Now they didn't know that, they didn't see that, they didn't
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:31.640]   understand the real meaning of lust. They didn't realize that lust is sinful in and
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:39.120]   of itself. And so, our Lord, you see, took them through all these illustrations in order
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:46.320]   to show them that their whole conception of the law was wrong, that the law is something
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.400]   spiritual, that the law is concerned about a man's heart. As he put it on another occasion
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.120]   when he was asked about the law, he says, "This is the law. You shall love the Lord
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.400]   thy God with all thy heart and mind and soul and strength, and the second, thou shalt love
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.800]   thy neighbor as thyself." That's the law. Not your tithing of mint and rue and anise
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:13.280]   and cumming and all these little details and minutiae. The law, he says, is something spiritual.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.480]   Its concern is with a man's heart and his ultimate attitude to God. That's the meaning
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.160]   of the law. Now, says the apostle, "It was only when I really understood the meaning
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:34.680]   of the law that I understood the truth about lust. I came to see that the covet is as reprehensible
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:40.360]   as to commit, that a desire is as damnable as a deed." He'd never seen that before.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.400]   It was the law, the true understanding of the law, that opened his eyes to this question
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:56.600]   of lust and of coveting. Once more, surely, we see the importance of this very matter.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:03.840]   But then he makes a second statement with respect to it. "I had not known lust," he
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:11.440]   says, "except the law had said, 'Thou shalt not covet.'" And I think he means, secondly,
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:19.000]   something like this, "I had never understood the power of lust and of desire within me
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:29.800]   until I really was enlightened by a true understanding of the law." Now, take this word "known."
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.840]   You notice he uses the word "known" twice. At least it's here in the authorized version.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:43.680]   "I had not known sin but by the law. I had not known lust except the law had said."
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:50.160]   Now, here it's "known" twice, and most of the other translations have the same.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.800]   But you know, the apostle used a different word the second time, and I'm amazed that
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:02.040]   the translators haven't concentrated on that. He didn't use the same word in the Greek
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:08.080]   in the first instance and in the second. The second one is much stronger than the first.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:15.880]   It means this. It means to know absolutely. It means to know as the result of reflection
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:23.120]   and experience. The first means a kind of apprehension. "I," says the apostle,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:30.440]   "would never have really apprehended sin but by the law." But now he says here, "I
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:38.600]   would never have understood and come to feel in the depth of my being and have a full understanding
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:44.880]   of the meaning of lust and the part that lust plays in a man's life were it not that the
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   Lord said to me, 'Thou shalt not covet.'" The law, in other words, had not only brought
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:33:00.400]   Paul to see that lust was to sin, it had brought him to see the terrible power of lust in his
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:07.360]   own life. He certainly includes that second meaning as well as the first.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.360]   So you see, the law had done this tremendous thing for him. He's going to show us this
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.760]   in greater detail in the next verses which follow. But here he's putting it out as a
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.720]   general statement. He says, "You know, I really had got no true understanding of sin
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:29.840]   until the law enlightened me. For instance, I'd been going on oblivious of the power
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   and the place of lust in my life until this command about coveting arrested me and I suddenly
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.960]   began to realize what was the truth about myself." Now then, here is his argument.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:49.640]   "A thing which does that cannot be evil. You mustn't say that the law is sin," says
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:57.040]   Paul. "It is the law that has brought me to see the meaning of sin and my own sinful
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:03.320]   condition as the result of this power of lust within me." "God forbid," he says,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:08.040]   "that anybody should think that I am teaching that the law is something sinful or evil.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.600]   I am saying the exact opposite." "Don't misunderstand me," says Paul. "The
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.160]   fact that I say that the law can't sanctify a man doesn't mean to say that I am arguing
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:23.400]   that the law is useless. The fact that I have said that the law aggravates sin doesn't
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.040]   mean that the law is sinful. No, no, I am going to show you," he says, "that it
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:33.560]   is this sinful principle that does that. The law itself is something glorious. I thank
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:40.080]   God for it. I would never have known a true acquaintance with sin, an apprehension of
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:45.560]   sin, were it not for the law. And especially, I would never have understood this matter
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:51.280]   of lusting and the place of lusting in my life were it not that this commandment had
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:59.000]   come and had convicted me." Now, that is his argument here in verse 7.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.440]   Obviously, he hasn't finished his explanation of his attitude to the law, but that at any
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:10.080]   rate is the first great lesson. He is going to show us further things about it. But let
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:20.400]   me just, before I close this evening, let me just take out this great lesson and underline
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:32.600]   it. Are we clear in our minds that to lust is to sin? Are we, as the apostle says he
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.240]   once was, in the position of thinking that as long as we don't do a thing, we have
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:43.480]   not been guilty of sin? Now, there are many who teach this. That is, for instance, the
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:50.800]   official Roman Catholic teaching concerning this matter. The Roman Catholic teaching is
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.480]   that as the result of being baptized by the Church, you are entirely cleansed from original
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:04.640]   sin. There is no longer indwelling sin. That is their teaching. So, they quite logically
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:11.240]   go on to teach that to lust is not to sin. It is only acts committed that constitute
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:19.440]   sin. That is a part of the whole error of that particular Church with regard to salvation.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.840]   But the teaching isn't confined to them. There have been certain perfectionist schools
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:33.760]   of teaching which have rarely said exactly the same thing. People who believe in eradication,
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:40.520]   they have to explain the difficulty of evil thoughts and desires and so on in exactly
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.880]   the same way. They do not regard that as sin. And it is because they do not regard that
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:54.440]   as sin that they try to establish their position of entire sanctification.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:59.040]   But the teaching of the apostle here, and not only here but elsewhere, is perfectly
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:12.920]   plain. As I say, our Lord himself teaches it so clearly. To desire to sin is sin. You
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:20.400]   can sin in your imagination, in your thought. That is as much sin, says our Lord, as the
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:26.680]   act. Obviously, there are differences in consequences and so on. But in the sight of God, the one
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:32.840]   is a sin as much as the other. He hath already committed adultery with her in his heart,
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:38.120]   and God seeth the heart. Now, said our Lord to these Pharisees, you are they that justify
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.960]   yourselves before men, but God seeth the heart. And that which is highly esteemed amongst
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:49.760]   men is abomination in the sight of God. You Pharisees, you stand up at the corners of
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.600]   the streets, he says, and in the marketplaces, and you say, "Look at us." You say, "We
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.480]   have never committed murder. We have never committed adultery." God sees your heart,
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.120]   and he knows that they are black, that they are full of sin. You have not done it in act,
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.040]   but you have done it in your heart. You have done it in thought. You have done it in your
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.320]   imagination. It is abomination in the sight of God.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:19.760]   Now, this is obviously a very crucial and very important teaching. It is an essential
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:28.720]   part of the apostle's whole exposition of this great doctrine of salvation. And it is
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.320]   to the extent to which we are clear about this, that we shall be able to follow his
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:41.680]   argument in the remainder of this particular chapter. The thing that awoke the apostle
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:49.480]   to see his need of a Savior from heaven was this question of lust. There he was convicted,
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:55.880]   and he only saw that when he saw the true character of the law as spiritual, and thereby
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   saw the true nature of sin. In other words, there is no better way of
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:12.840]   testing our own understanding of the Christian doctrine of salvation than to examine our
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:24.400]   understanding of the true nature of sin, and especially as regards this question of lust.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:31.120]   Very well, we leave it at that for this evening. I was anxious above everything else tonight
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:37.880]   that we should get our setting, that we should get our context, because if we don't go on
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:45.480]   carrying this in our minds, we shall inevitably go astray when we come to the particular verses
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.360]   and their detailed teaching. Now then, we have got the big principle tonight.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:57.520]   Paul is showing that the law is not sin. Thank God it isn't. Thank God that it has done what
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:04.260]   it has done to bring him to a knowledge of sin, and especially in terms of coveting.
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:11.800]   God grant that we all may be able to join him in the rejection of the other suggestion,
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:19.560]   and in the offering of praise and of thanksgiving to God for his holy law and for its work in
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:25.760]   us and upon us. Let us pray. Almighty God, we do indeed come unto thee
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:34.640]   to thank thee. Oh, we see how frail and fallible we are, how prone to wander in our minds and
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:42.960]   understandings. We see the subtleties of sin and of Satan, and we do again come together
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:49.260]   to thank thee for thy word. Oh God, we are amazed at thine infinite condescension with
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:55.020]   respect to us, that thou didst ever cause thy servant the apostle of old to write words
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:00.980]   such as these in order that we might be protected against misunderstanding. We thank thee for
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:06.820]   thy patience with us, to work it out thus in detail, to take up objections and refute
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.940]   them and answer them, and go on with the positive exposition of the truth.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:20.060]   Oh Lord, receive our humble and unworthy praise. More than ever, we see that we are saved alone
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:27.060]   by thy power, and not by ourselves, nor our own understandings, nor our own wills, nor
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.100]   efforts. We thank thee that we are indeed thy workmanship, that we are in thy powerful
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:39.540]   and almighty hands, that we are under the reign of grace, and that nothing can prevent
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:47.860]   it nor frustrate it. Oh Lord, receive our thanksgiving, our praise, and our worship.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:54.780]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:01.020]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us, now this night,
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:06.700]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.780]   evermore. Amen.
