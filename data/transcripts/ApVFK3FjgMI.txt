[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   - Drawing inspiration from real life,
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.040]   so for devs, for Ex Machina,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.080]   look at characters like Elon Musk.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.840]   What do you think about the various big technological efforts
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.040]   of Elon Musk and others like him
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.780]   that he's involved with, such as Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink?
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.720]   Do you see any of that technology
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.600]   potentially defining the future worlds
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.040]   you create in your work?
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.160]   So Tesla is automation, SpaceX is space exploration,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.800]   Neuralink is brain-machine interface,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.920]   somehow a merger of biological and electric systems.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.320]   - In a way, I'm influenced by that almost by definition
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.960]   because that's the world I live in
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.400]   and this is the thing that's happening in that world.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.580]   And I also feel supportive of it.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.160]   So I think amongst various things,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.880]   Elon Musk has done, I'm almost sure
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.680]   he's done a very, very good thing with Tesla for all of us.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.720]   It's really kicked all the other car manufacturers
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.280]   in the face, it's kicked the fossil fuel industry
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.840]   in the face and they needed kicking in the face
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.680]   and he's done it.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.480]   So, and so that's the world he's part of creating
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.440]   and I live in that world, just bought a Tesla in fact.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.440]   And so does that play into whatever I then make?
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.020]   In some ways it does, partly because I try to be a writer
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.560]   who quite often filmmakers are in some ways fixated
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.480]   on the films they grew up with
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.160]   and they sort of remake those films in some ways.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.800]   I've always tried to avoid that.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.240]   And so I look to the real world to get inspiration
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.880]   and as much as possible sort of by living, I think.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.920]   And so, yeah, I'm sure.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.780]   - Which of the directions do you find most exciting?
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.760]   - Space travel.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.060]   - Space travel.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.660]   So you haven't really explored space travel in your work.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.220]   You've said something like if you had unlimited amount
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.700]   of money, I think I read it at AMA,
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.460]   that you would make like a multi-year series
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.580]   of space wars or something like that.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.220]   So what is it that excites you about space exploration?
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.220]   - Well, because if we have any sort of long-term future,
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.400]   it's that.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.720]   It just simply is that.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.360]   If energy and matter are linked up
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.400]   in the way we think they're linked up,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.000]   we'll run out if we don't move.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.160]   So we gotta move.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.400]   But also, how can we not?
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.860]   It's built into us to do it or die trying.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.860]   I was on Easter Island a few months ago,
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.700]   which is, as I'm sure you know,
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.720]   in the middle of the Pacific
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.360]   and difficult for people to have got to,
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.540]   but they got there.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.780]   And I did think a lot about the way those boats
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.580]   must have set out into something like space.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.780]   It was the ocean.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.220]   And how sort of fundamental that was to the way we are.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.180]   And it's the one that most excites me
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.220]   because it's the one I want most to happen.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.120]   It's the thing, it's the place
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.160]   where we could get to as humans.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.120]   Like in a way, I could live with us never really unlocking,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.520]   fully unlocking the nature of consciousness.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.660]   I'd like to know, I'm really curious.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.520]   But if we never leave the solar system
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.800]   and if we never get further out into this galaxy,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.440]   or maybe even galaxies beyond our galaxy,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.600]   that would, that feels sad to me
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.040]   because it's so limiting.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.400]   - Yeah, there's something hopeful and beautiful
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.680]   about reaching out, any kind of exploration,
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.880]   reaching out across earth centuries ago
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.720]   and then reaching out into space.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.640]   So what do you think about colonization of Mars?
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.480]   So go to Mars.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.300]   Does that excite you, the idea of a human being
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.840]   stepping foot on Mars?
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.760]   - It does.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   It absolutely does.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.840]   But in terms of what would really excite me,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.680]   it would be leaving the solar system.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.560]   In as much as that, I just think,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.300]   I think we already know quite a lot about Mars.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.880]   And, but yes, listen, if it happened,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.520]   that would be, I hope I see it in my lifetime.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.600]   I really hope I see it in my lifetime.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.240]   So it would be a wonderful thing.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.680]   (silence)
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.840]   (silence)
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.000]   (silence)
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.160]   (silence)
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.320]   (silence)
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.480]   (silence)
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.640]   (silence)
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
