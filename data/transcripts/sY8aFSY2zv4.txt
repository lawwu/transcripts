[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   - Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.560]   And if you gaze into the abyss,
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.960]   the abyss gazes also into you.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.200]   - But I would say, bring it on.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.280]   If you gaze into the abyss long enough,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.240]   you see the light, not the darkness.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240]   - Are you sure about that?
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.680]   - I'm betting my life on it.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.240]   - The following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.840]   an influential psychologist, lecturer, podcast host,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.240]   and author of "Maps of Meaning,"
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.760]   "12 Rules for Life," and "Beyond Order."
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.680]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.680]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.000]   in the description.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.980]   And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Peterson.
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.440]   Dostoevsky wrote in "The Idiot,"
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.840]   spoken through the character of Prince Mishkin,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.120]   "That beauty will save the world."
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.680]   Solzhenitsyn actually mentioned this
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.240]   in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.480]   What do you think Dostoevsky meant by that?
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.120]   Was he right?
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.120]   - Well, I guess it's the divine that saves the world,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.920]   let's say.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160]   You could say that by definition.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.400]   And then you might say, well, are there pointers
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.300]   to that which will save the world,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.140]   or that which eternally saves the world?
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.360]   And the answer to that, in all likelihood, is yes.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.600]   And that's maybe truth and love and justice
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320]   and the classical virtues, beauty,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.640]   perhaps in some sense foremost among them.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640]   That's a difficult case to make, but definitely a pointer.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.480]   - Which direction is the arrow pointing?
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.640]   - Well, the arrow's pointing up.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.240]   No, I think that that which it points to
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.000]   is what beauty points to.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.360]   It transcends beauty.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.480]   It's more than beauty.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.400]   - And that speaks to the divine.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.240]   - It points to the divine.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   Yeah, and I would say, again, by definition,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.460]   'cause we could define the divine in some real sense.
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.360]   So one way of defining the divine is,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440]   what is divine to you is your most fundamental axiom.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.020]   And you might say, well, I don't have a fundamental axiom.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.280]   Then I would say, that's fine,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.760]   but then you're just confused
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.960]   'cause you have a bunch of contradictory axioms.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.040]   And you might say, well, I have no axioms at all.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.200]   And then I'd say, well, you're just epistemologically
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.000]   ignorant beyond comprehension, if you think that,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.640]   'cause that's just not true at all.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.400]   - So do you don't think a human being can exist
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.160]   within contradictions?
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.280]   - Well, yeah, we have to exist within contradiction,
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.800]   but when the contradictions make themselves manifest,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.020]   it's in confusion with regard to direction,
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.760]   then the consequence of that technically is anxiety
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.360]   and frustration and disappointment
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.040]   and all sorts of other negative emotions.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.920]   But the cardinal negative emotion
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   signifying multiple pathways forward is anxiety.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.080]   It's an entropy signal.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.920]   - But you don't think that kind of entropy signal
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.520]   can be channeled into beauty, into love?
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.680]   Why does beauty and love have to be clear,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.480]   ordered, simple?
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.700]   - Well, I would say it probably doesn't have to be,
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.440]   it can't be reduced to clarity and simplicity
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.880]   because when it's optimally structured,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.880]   it's a balance between order and chaos, not order itself.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.280]   If it's too ordered, if music is too ordered,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.180]   it's not acceptable.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.560]   It sounds like a drum machine.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.720]   It's too repetitive.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.560]   It's too predictable.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.360]   It has to have, well, it has to have some fire in it
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.020]   along with the structure.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.760]   I was in Miami doing a seminar on Exodus
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.180]   with a number of scholars,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.880]   and this is a beauty discussion.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.380]   When Moses first encounters the burning bush,
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   it's not a conflagration that demands attention.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.500]   It's something that catches his attention.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.960]   It's a phenomena, and that means to shine forth,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.260]   and Moses has to stop and attend to it, and he does,
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.540]   and he sees this fire that doesn't consume the tree,
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.720]   and the tree, the tree is a structure, right?
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's a tree-like structure.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.100]   It's a branching structure.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.040]   It's a hierarchical structure.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's a self-similar structure.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.160]   It's a fractal structure, and it's the tree of life,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.000]   and it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.040]   and the fire in it is the transformation
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.360]   that's always occurring within every structure,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.560]   and the fact that the fire doesn't consume the bush
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.400]   in that representation is an indication
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.840]   of the balance of transformation with structure,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.920]   and that balance is presented as God,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.320]   and what attracts Moses to it, in some sense, is the beauty.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.820]   Now, it's the novelty and all that,
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.480]   but like a painting is like a burning bush.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.760]   That's a good way of thinking about it, a great painting.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.720]   It's too much for people often.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.080]   You know, my house was, and will soon be again,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.200]   completely covered with paintings inside,
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.800]   and it was hard on people to come in there,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.500]   because, well, my mother, for example, would say,
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.040]   "Well, why would you want to live in a museum?"
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.120]   And I'd think, "Well, I would rather live in a museum
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.840]   "than anywhere else, in some real sense,"
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.240]   but beauty is daunting.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.080]   It scares people.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.200]   They're terrified of buying art, for example,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.720]   because their taste is on display,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.760]   and they should be terrified,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   because generally, people have terrible taste.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.520]   Now, that doesn't mean they shouldn't foster it
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.400]   and develop it, but, and you know,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.440]   when you put your taste on display,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.720]   it really exposes you.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.600]   - Even to yourself, as you walk past it every day.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.040]   - Absolutely. - This is who I am.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.360]   - Yeah, well, and look how mundane that is,
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.400]   and look how trite it is, and look at how cliched it is,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.800]   and look at how sterile or too ordered it is,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.140]   or too chaotic.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.160]   - Or how quickly you start to take it for granted,
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.600]   because you've seen it so many times.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.560]   - Well, if it's a real piece of art, that doesn't happen.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.400]   - You notice the little details.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.720]   - The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.640]   I mean, there are images, religious images in particular,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.120]   so we could call them deep images,
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.080]   that people have been unpacking for 4,000 years,
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.240]   and still haven't, I'll give you an example.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.760]   This is a terrible example.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   So, I did a lecture series on Genesis,
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.040]   and I got a lot of it unpacked,
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.640]   but by no means all of it.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.200]   When God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.400]   he puts cherubim with flaming swords at the gate
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.920]   to stop human beings from reentering paradise.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.160]   I thought, what the hell does that mean, cherubim,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.760]   and why do they have flaming swords?
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   I don't get that, what is that exactly?
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.280]   And then I found out from Matthew Paggio,
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.220]   who wrote a great book on symbolism in Genesis,
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.140]   that cherubim are the supporting monsters of God.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.100]   It's a very complicated idea,
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.700]   and that they're partly a representation of that
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.120]   which is difficult to fit into conceptual systems.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.980]   They've also got an angelic or demonic aspect,
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.300]   take your pick.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.300]   Why do they have flaming swords?
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.580]   Well, a sword is a symbol of judgment
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.580]   and the separation of the wheat from the chaff.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.340]   You use a sword to cut away, to cut away and to carve.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.140]   And a flaming sword is not only that which carves,
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.260]   it's that which burns.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.700]   And what does it carve away and burn?
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.400]   Well, you wanna get into paradise?
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.460]   It carves away everything about you that isn't perfect.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.020]   And so what does that mean?
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.700]   Okay, well, here's part of what it means.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.700]   This is a terrible thing.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.060]   So you could say that the entire Christian narrative
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.780]   is embedded in that image.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.940]   Why?
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.540]   Well, let's say that flaming swords are a symbol of death.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.740]   That seems pretty obvious.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.380]   Let's say further that they're a symbol
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.680]   of apocalypse and hell.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.520]   That doesn't seem completely unreasonable.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.860]   So here's an idea.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.740]   Not only do you have to face death,
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.940]   you have to face death and hell
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.120]   before you can get to paradise.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.780]   Hellish judgment.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.500]   And all that's embedded in that image.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.580]   And a piece of art with an image like that
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.740]   has all that information in it.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.600]   And it shines forth in some fundamental sense.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.620]   It reaches into the back tendrils of your mind
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.500]   at levels you can't even comprehend and grips you.
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.420]   I mean, that's why people go to museums
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.860]   and gaze at paintings they don't understand.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.320]   And that's why they'll pay,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.700]   what's the most expensive objects in the world?
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.720]   If it's not carbon fiber racing yachts,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.940]   it's definitely classic paintings.
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.740]   It's high level technological implements.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.100]   Or it's classic art.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.940]   Well, why are those things so expensive?
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.860]   Why do we build temples to house the images?
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.600]   Even secular people go to museums.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.780]   I'm secular.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.960]   Well, are you in a museum?
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.800]   Yes.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.620]   Are you looking at art?
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.460]   Yes.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.820]   Well, what makes you think you're secular then?
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.060]   - It's arguable that the thing many, many centuries
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.620]   from now that will remain of all of human civilization
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.300]   will be our art.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.980]   Not even the words.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.620]   - Well, a book has remained a very long time, right?
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.460]   The biblical writings.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.280]   - Not that long.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.740]   A few millennia.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.140]   - That's right.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.380]   - But that's in the full arc of living organisms.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.220]   Perhaps we'll not--
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.540]   - Well, we have artistic images
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.940]   that are at least 50,000 years old, right?
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.380]   That have survived.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.380]   And some of those are,
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.740]   they're already profound in their symbolism.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.260]   - By we do you mean humans?
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.460]   - Yeah, we found them.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.460]   And they've lasted that long.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.260]   And so, and then think about Europe.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.740]   Secular people all over the world
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.900]   make pilgrimages to Europe.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.360]   Well, why?
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.140]   Because of the beauty.
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.980]   Obviously.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.700]   I mean, that's self-evident.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.200]   And it's partly because there are things in Europe
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.040]   that are so beautiful.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.300]   They take your breath away, right?
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.580]   They make your hair stand on end.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.620]   They fill you with a sense of awe.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.380]   And we need to see those things.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.460]   It's not optional.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.080]   We need to see those things.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.920]   The cathedrals.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.540]   I was in a cathedral in Vienna
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.780]   and it was terribly beautiful.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.620]   - Terribly beautiful.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.060]   - Well, it was terribly beautiful.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.620]   - Is beauty painful for you?
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.300]   Is that the highest form of beauty
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.660]   that really challenges you?
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.060]   - Oh, definitely.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.940]   I got a good analysis of the statue of David.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.420]   Michelangelo's statue says,
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.020]   you could be far more than you are.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.980]   That's what that statue says.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.860]   And this cathedral, we went down into the under structure
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.860]   of it and there were three floors of bones from the plague.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.620]   And there they all are.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.140]   And then that cathedral's on top of it.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.540]   It's no joke to go visit a place like that.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.420]   No, it rattles you to the core.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.020]   And our religious systems have become
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.420]   propositionally dubious.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.340]   But there's no arguing with the architecture,
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.460]   although modern architects like to,
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.220]   with their sterility and their giant middle fingers
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.440]   erected everywhere.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.700]   But beauty is a terrible pointer to God.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.380]   And you know, a secular person will say,
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.480]   well, I don't believe in God.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.120]   It's like, have it your way.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.780]   You cannot move forward into the unforeseen horizon
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.900]   of the future, except on faith.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.380]   And you might say, well, I have no faith.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.300]   It's like, well, good luck with the future then,
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.900]   because what are you then?
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.380]   Nihilistic and hopeless and anxiety ridden?
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.100]   And if not, well, something's guiding you forward.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.620]   It's faith in something or multiple things,
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.980]   which just makes you a polytheist,
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.180]   which I wouldn't recommend.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.540]   - Well, let me ask you one short-lived
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.820]   biological meat bag to another.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.740]   Who is God then?
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.300]   Let's try to sneak up to this question
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.620]   if it's at all possible.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.660]   Is it possible to even talk about this?
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.860]   - Well, it better be,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.980]   because otherwise there's no communicating about it.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.340]   It has to be something that can be brought down to earth.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.740]   - Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.340]   - It's not just ignorant, it's also sinful.
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.540]   Because there's not knowing,
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.540]   and then there's wanting to know or refusing to know.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.820]   And so you might say, well, could you extract God
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.020]   from a description of the objective world?
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.900]   Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality?
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.340]   And I would say, well, in a sense,
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.740]   there's some truth in that, but not exactly,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.100]   because God in the highest sense is the spirit
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.060]   that you must emulate in order to thrive.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.460]   How's that for a biological definition?
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.460]   Spirit is a pattern.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.140]   The spirit that you must emulate in order to thrive.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.260]   - So it's a kind of, in one sense,
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.580]   when we say the human spirit, it's that.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.780]   - It's an animating principle, yeah.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.020]   It's a meta, it's a pattern.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.620]   And you might say, well, what's the pattern?
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.300]   Okay, well, I can tell you that to some degree.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.820]   Imagine that like you're gripped by beauty,
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.140]   you're gripped by admiration.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.940]   So, and you can just notice this.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.620]   This isn't propositional, you have to notice it.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.200]   It's like, oh, it turns out I admire that person.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.100]   So what does that mean?
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.860]   Well, it means I would like to be like him or her.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.940]   That's what admiration means.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.940]   It means there's something about the way they are
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.060]   that compels imitation, another instinct,
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.540]   or inspires respect or awe, even.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.780]   Okay, what is that that grips you?
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.300]   Well, I don't know.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.980]   Well, let's say, okay, fine, but it grips you,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.380]   and you want to be like that.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.180]   Kids hero worship, for example,
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.580]   and so do adults, for that matter,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.140]   unless they become entirely cynical.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.380]   - I worship quite a few heroes.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.780]   - Well, there you go. - Proudly.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.340]   - Yes, well, there you go.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.380]   And there's no, that worship, that celebration
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.460]   and proclivity to imitate is worship.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.180]   That's what worship means most fundamentally.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:16.020]   Now imagine you took the set of all admirable people,
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.980]   and you extracted out AI learning.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   You extracted out the central features
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.260]   of what constitutes admirable.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.700]   And then you did that repeatedly
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.700]   until you purified it to what was most admirable.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.580]   That's as good as you're going to get
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.180]   in terms of a representation of God.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.620]   And you might say, well, I don't believe in that.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.860]   It's like, well, what do you mean?
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.860]   It's not a set of propositional facts.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.580]   It's not a scientific theory
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.460]   about the structure of the objective world.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.140]   And then I could say something about that too,
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.660]   because I've been thinking about this a lot,
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.380]   especially since talking to Richard Dawkins.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.380]   It's like, okay, the postmodernist types,
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.700]   going back way before Derrida and Foucault,
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.740]   maybe back to Nietzsche,
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.380]   who I admire greatly, by the way,
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.660]   says God is dead.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.380]   It's like, okay, but Nietzsche said God is dead,
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.220]   and we have killed him,
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.980]   and we'll not find enough water to wash away all the blood.
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.140]   So that was Nietzsche.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.140]   He's no fool.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.140]   - He's got a way with words.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.740]   - He certainly does.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.100]   And so then you think, okay, well, we killed the transcendent.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.700]   Well, what does that mean for science?
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.740]   Well, it frees it up,
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.300]   because all that nonsense about a deity
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.420]   is just the idiot superstition
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.420]   that stops the scientific process from moving forward.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.580]   That's basically the new atheist claim, something like that.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.020]   It's like, wait a second.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.500]   Do you believe in the transcendent if you're a scientist?
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.860]   And the answer is, well, not only do you believe in it,
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.500]   you believe in it more than anything else,
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.700]   because if you're a scientist,
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.180]   you believe in what objects to your theory
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.460]   more than you believe in your theory.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.420]   Now, we gotta think that through very carefully.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.960]   So your theory describes the world,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.200]   and as far as you're concerned,
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.340]   your description of the world is the world.
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.020]   But because you're a scientist, you think,
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.940]   well, even though that's my description of the world,
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.800]   and that's what I believe,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.080]   there's something beyond what I believe,
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.100]   and that's the object.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.340]   And so I'm gonna throw my theory against the object
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.740]   and see where it'll break,
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.340]   and then I'm going to use the evidence of the break
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.780]   as a source of new information to revitalize my theory.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.420]   So as a scientist, you have to posit the existence
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.900]   of the ontological transcendent
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.260]   before you can move forward at all, but more.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.580]   You have to posit that contact
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.080]   with the ontological transcendent,
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.420]   annoying though it is because it upsets your apple cart,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.740]   is exactly what will in fact set you free.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.420]   So then you accept the proposition
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.560]   that there is a transcendent reality,
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.500]   and that contact with that transcendent reality
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.020]   is redemptive in the most fundamental sense,
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.860]   because if it wasn't,
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.860]   well, why would you bother making contact with it?
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.300]   You're gonna make everything worse or better.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.060]   - Why does the contact with the transcendent
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.820]   set you free as a scientist?
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.860]   - 'Cause you assume that, you assume,
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.940]   I mean freedom in the most fundamental sense.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.180]   It's like, well, freedom from want, freedom from disease,
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.060]   freedom from ignorance, right?
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.420]   That it informs you.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.860]   - So it's the five of science. - The logos in it.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.420]   It is definitely that.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.760]   Yeah, it's the direction,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.460]   let's say the directionality of science,
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.180]   that's a narrative direction, not a scientific direction.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.500]   And then the question is, what is the narrative?
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.860]   Well, it posits a transcendent reality.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.700]   It posits that the transcendent reality is corrective.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.540]   It posits that our knowledge structure
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.020]   should be regarded with humility.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.280]   It posits that you should bow down
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.820]   in the face of the transcendent evidence.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.540]   And you have to take a vow, you know this as a scientist,
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.500]   you have to take a vow to follow that path
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.820]   if you're gonna be a real scientist.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.480]   It's like the truth, no matter what,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.220]   and that means you posit the truth as a redemptive force.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.460]   Well, what does redemptive mean?
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.780]   Well, why bother with science?
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.260]   Well, so people don't starve,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.300]   so people can move about more effectively,
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.080]   so life can be more abundant, right?
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.780]   So it's all ensconced within an underlying ethic.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.120]   So the reason I was saying that
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.800]   while we were talking about belief in God,
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.260]   it's like, this is a very complicated topic, right?
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.080]   Do you believe in a transcendent reality?
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.580]   See, okay, now let's say you buy the argument
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.080]   I just made on the natural front,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.720]   you say, yeah, yeah, that's just nature, that's not God.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.400]   And then I'd say, well, what makes you think
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.680]   you know what nature is?
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.000]   Like, see, the problem with that argument
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.320]   is that it already presumes a reductionist
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.240]   materialist objective view of what constitutes nature.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.640]   But if you're a scientist, you're gonna think,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.280]   well, in the final analysis, I don't know what nature is.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.420]   I certainly don't know its origin or destination point.
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.360]   I don't know its teleology.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.840]   I'm really ignorant about nature.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.700]   And so when I say it's nothing but nature,
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.400]   I shouldn't mean it's nothing
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.720]   but what I understand nature to be.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.580]   So I could say, will we have a fully reductionist account
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.320]   of cognitive processes?
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.380]   And the answer to that is yes, but by the time we do that,
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.580]   our understanding of matter will have transformed so much
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.580]   that what we think of as reductionist now
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.220]   won't look anything like what we think of reductionism now.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.060]   Matter isn't dead dust.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.780]   I don't know what it is.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.300]   I have no idea what it is.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.100]   Matter is what matters.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.460]   There's a definition.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.580]   That's a very weird definition.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.540]   But the notion that we have,
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.100]   you know, that if you're a reductionist,
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.260]   a materialist reductionist,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.820]   that you can reduce the complexity of what is
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.060]   to your assumptions about the nature of matter.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.980]   That's not a scientific--
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.460]   - Your specific limited human assumptions
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.740]   of this century, of this week, that,
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.740]   so in some sense, without God,
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.380]   in this complicated, big definition we're talking about,
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.980]   there's no humility, or it's less--
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.820]   - It's not enough.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.260]   - There's less likely to be,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.420]   or rather science can err in taking a trajectory
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.820]   away from humility.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.660]   - Well--
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.020]   - Without something much more powerful
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.220]   than an individual human.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.820]   - Yeah, well then, and we know, you know,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.540]   the Frankenstein story comes out of that instantly.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.740]   And that's a good story for the current times.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.900]   It's like, you're playing around with making new life?
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.740]   You bloody well better make sure
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.420]   you have your arrows pointed up.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.820]   - And it's interesting because you said
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.140]   science has an ethic to it.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.980]   I think--
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.340]   - It's embedded in an ethic.
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.460]   - Well, there's a, you know, science is a big word.
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.300]   - Yeah.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.220]   - And it includes a lot of disciplines
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.500]   that have different traditions.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.620]   So biology, chemistry, genetics, physics,
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.700]   those are very different communities.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.540]   And I think biology, especially when you get closer
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.180]   and closer to medicine and to the human body,
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.420]   does have a very serious, first of all,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.780]   has a history with Nazi Germany of being abused
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.260]   and all those kinds of things.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.100]   But it has a history of taking this stuff seriously.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.580]   What doesn't have a history of taking this stuff seriously
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.660]   is robotics and artificial intelligence,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.300]   which is really interesting.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.260]   Because you don't, you know, you called me a scientist,
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.860]   but, and I would like to wear that label proudly,
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.780]   but often people don't think of computer science
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.500]   as a science, but nevertheless, it will be, I think,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.820]   the science of one of the major scientific fields
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.300]   of the 21st century.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.660]   And you should take that very seriously.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.580]   Oftentimes when people build robots or AI systems,
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.180]   they think of them as toys to tinker with.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.980]   Oh, isn't this cool?
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.300]   And I feel this too, isn't this cool?
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.420]   - It is cool.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.820]   - But, you know, at a certain moment, you might,
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.380]   isn't this nuclear explosion cool?
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.420]   - Yeah. - Because it is.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.800]   - Or birth control pill cool, it's like,
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.620]   or transistor cool, yeah.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.220]   Well, the other thing too, and this is a weird problem
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.380]   in some sense, the robotics engineer types,
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.980]   they're thing people, right?
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.500]   I mean, the big classes of interest are interest in things
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.700]   versus interest in people.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.700]   - Some of my best friends are thing people.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.100]   - Yeah, right, and thing people are very, very clear,
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.380]   logical thinkers, and they're very outcome oriented
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.100]   and practical.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.220]   Now, and that's all good.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.020]   That makes the machinery and keeps it functioning.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.340]   But there's a human side of the equation.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.980]   And you get the extreme thing people, and you think,
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.260]   yeah, well, what about the human here?
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.740]   And when we're talking about, we've been talking
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.740]   about the necessity of having a technological enterprise
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.540]   embedded in an ethic, and you can ignore that.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.300]   Like most of the time, right?
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.460]   You can ignore the overall ethic in some sense
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.900]   when you're toying around with your toys.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.020]   But when you're building an artificial intelligence,
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.120]   it's like, well, that's not a toy.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.500]   That might be--
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.220]   - Toy becomes the monster very quickly.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.860]   - Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.940]   And this is a whole new kind of monster.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.560]   And maybe it's already here.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.060]   Yes, and you notice how many of those things
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.660]   you can no longer turn off.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.180]   And what is it with you engineers and your inability
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.440]   to put off switches on things now?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.880]   It's like, I have to hold this for five seconds
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.960]   for it to shut off, or I can't figure it.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.780]   I just wanna shut it off, click off.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.300]   - Well, what is it with you humans that don't put off
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.020]   switches on other humans?
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.580]   Because there's a magic to the thing that you notice,
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.380]   and it hurts for both you and perhaps one day
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.980]   the thing itself to turn it off.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.180]   And so you have to be very careful as an engineer
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.980]   adding off switches to things.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.380]   I think it's a feature, not a bug, the off switch.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.020]   The off switch gives a deadline to us humans,
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.660]   to systems of existence.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.260]   It makes you, you know, death is the thing
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.780]   that really brings clarity to life.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.620]   And I do think--
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.780]   - Yes, hence the flaming swords.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.620]   - The flaming sword.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.300]   I do like your view of the flame, the bush,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.660]   and perhaps the sword as a thing of transformation.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.740]   It's also, it's a transformation that kind of
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.380]   consumes the thing in the process.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.300]   - Well, it depends on how much of the thing is chaff.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.220]   You know, this is why you can't touch
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.660]   the Ark of the Covenant, for example.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.060]   And this is why people can have very bad psychedelic trips.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.940]   It's like if you're 95% deadwood,
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.140]   and you get too close to the flame,
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.620]   the 5% that's left might not be able to make it.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.700]   - So you think it's all chaff,
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.340]   but I think there is some aspect of destruction that is,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.860]   that's, you know, the old Bukowski line of
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.460]   do what you love and let it kill you.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.300]   - Right.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.540]   - Don't you think that destruction's part of--
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.180]   - That's humility.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.060]   - That's humility, that's--
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.580]   - You bet, you bet, you bet.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.180]   It's like, invite in the judgment.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.100]   Invite in the judgment, because maybe you can die
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.020]   a little bit instead of dying completely.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.860]   - Yeah.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.220]   - You know, and that's, I think it's Alfred North Whitehead.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.380]   We can let our ideas die instead of us, right?
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.700]   We can have these partial personalities
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.580]   that we can burn off, and we can let them go
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.980]   before they become tyrannical pharaohs
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.220]   and we lose everything.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.380]   And so, yeah, there's this optimal bite of death.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.620]   And who knows what it would mean to optimize that?
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.460]   Like, what if it was possible that if you died enough
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.180]   all the time, that you could continue to live?
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.260]   And the thing is, we already know that biologically,
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.460]   because if you don't die properly all the time,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.020]   well, it's cancerous outgrowths,
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.020]   and it's a very fine balance between productivity
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:14.020]   on the biological front and the culling of that, right?
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.620]   Life is a real balance between growth and death.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.300]   And so what would happen if you got that balance right?
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.540]   Well, we kinda know, right?
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.900]   Because if you live your life properly, so to speak,
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.740]   and you're humble enough to let your stupidity die
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.020]   before it takes you out, you will live longer.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.260]   That's just a fact.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.060]   Well, but then what's the ultimate extension of that?
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.660]   And the answer is, we don't know.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.140]   We have no idea.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.940]   - Well, let me ask you a difficult question, because--
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.620]   - As opposed to the easy ones that you've been asking so far.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.820]   - Well, Dostoevsky's always just a warmup.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.140]   So if death, if death every single day
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.020]   is the way to progress through life,
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.620]   you have become quite famous.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.100]   - Death and hell.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:00.940]   - Death and hell.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.700]   - Yeah, yeah, 'cause you don't wanna forget the hell part.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:08.660]   - Do you worry that your fame traps you
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.300]   into the person that you were before?
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.220]   - Yeah, well, Elvis became an Elvis impersonator
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.460]   by the time he died.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.220]   - Yeah, do you fear that you have become
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.620]   a Jordan Peterson impersonator?
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.260]   Do you fear of, in some part, becoming
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.260]   the famous suit-wearing, brilliant Jordan Peterson,
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:34.260]   the certainty in the pursuit of truth, always right?
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.940]   - I think I worry about it more than anything else.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.180]   I hope, I hope I do.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.020]   I better.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:43.100]   - Has fame, to some degree, when you look at yourself
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.580]   in the mirror, in the quiet of your mind,
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.700]   has it corrupted you?
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.180]   - No doubt, in some regard.
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.300]   I mean, it's a very difficult thing to avoid,
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.140]   because things change around you.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.300]   People are much more likely to do what you ask,
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.860]   for example, right?
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.380]   And so that's a danger, because one of the things
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.380]   that keeps you dying properly is that people push back
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.820]   against you, optimally.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.460]   This is why so many celebrities spiral out of control,
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.180]   especially the tyrannical types that, say, run countries.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.380]   Everyone around them stops saying,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.140]   yeah, you're deviating a little bit there.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.540]   They laugh at all their jokes.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.780]   They open all their doors.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.300]   They always want something from them.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.300]   The red carpet's always rolled out.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.780]   It's like, well, you think, wouldn't that be lovely?
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.020]   It's, well, not if the red carpet is rolled out to you
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.260]   while you're on your way to perdition.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.820]   That's not a good deal.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.020]   You just get there more efficiently.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.180]   And so one of the things that I've tried to learn to manage
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:48.180]   is just to have people around me all the time who are critics,
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.700]   who are saying, yeah, I could have done that better.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.900]   And you're a little too harsh there.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.660]   And you're alienating people unnecessarily there.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.980]   And you should have done some more background work there.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.180]   And I think the responsibility attendant upon that
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.740]   increases as your influence increases.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.940]   And as your influence increases, then that
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.460]   becomes a lot of responsibility.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.820]   So and then maybe have an off day.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.260]   And well, here's an example.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.380]   I've been writing some columns lately
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:24.260]   about things that perturb me, like the forthcoming famine,
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.580]   for example.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:31.100]   And it's hard to take those problems on.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.340]   It's difficult to take those problems on
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.380]   in a serious manner.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.540]   And it's frightening.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.540]   And it would be easier just to go up to the cottage
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.900]   with my wife and go out on the lake and watch the sunset.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:48.100]   And so I'm tempted to draw on anger as a motivating energy
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.020]   to help me overcome the resistance to doing this.
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.980]   But then that makes me more harsh and judgmental in my tone
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.060]   when I'm reading such things, for example, on YouTube,
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.260]   than might be optimal.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.260]   Now, I've had debates with people about that.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.540]   Because I have friends who say, no,
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:10.660]   if you're calling out the environmentalist globalists who
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.460]   are harassing the Dutch farmers, then a little anger
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.860]   is just the ticket.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.940]   But then others say, well, you don't
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.420]   want to be too harsh because you alienate people who would
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.020]   otherwise listen to you.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.900]   It's like, that's a hard balance to get right.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.380]   But also maybe anger hardens your mind
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.180]   to where you don't notice the subtle, quiet beauty
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.540]   of the world, the quiet love that's always there,
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.180]   that permeates everything.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.860]   Sometimes you can become deeply cynical about the world
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.860]   if it's the Nietzsche thing.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.780]   Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.780]   And if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.860]   But I would say, bring it on.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:56.780]   Right?
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.340]   Well--
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.980]   That's why I also say, knowing that he's absolutely right,
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.420]   but if you gaze into the abyss long enough,
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.580]   you see the light, not the darkness.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.380]   Are you sure about that?
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.580]   I'm betting my life on it.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.180]   Yeah, that's a heck of a bet.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:12.820]   Well, that's--
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.460]   Because it might distort your mind to where all you see--
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.380]   Is abyss.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.620]   Is abyss.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.260]   Is the evil in this world.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.180]   Well, then I would say you haven't looked long enough.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.900]   You know, that's back to the--
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   You're just a limited--
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.340]   --the swords, the flaming swords.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.060]   So I said the whole story of Christ
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.260]   was prefigured in that image.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.900]   It's like, the story of Christ, psychologically,
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.780]   is radical acceptance of the worst possible tragedy.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.660]   That's what it means.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.980]   That's what the crucifix means.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.100]   Psychologically, it's like, gaze upon that
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.700]   which you are most afraid of.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.500]   But that story doesn't end there.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.460]   Because in the story, Christ goes through death into hell.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.300]   So death isn't enough.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.260]   The abyss of innocent death is not
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.720]   sufficient to produce redemption.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.180]   It has to be a voluntary journey to hell.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.260]   And maybe that's true for everyone.
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.380]   And that's like-- there is no more terrifying idea than that,
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.380]   by definition.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.940]   And so then, well, do you gaze upon that?
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.700]   Well, who knows?
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.340]   Who knows?
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.460]   How often do you gaze upon death, your own?
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.060]   How often do you remember, remind yourself,
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.420]   that this ride ends?
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.300]   Personally?
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.540]   Personally.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.740]   All the time.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.700]   Because you, as a deep thinker and a philosopher,
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.780]   it's easy to start philosophizing and forgetting
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.020]   that you might die today.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.620]   The angel of death sits on every word.
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.700]   How's that?
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.100]   How often do you actually consciously--
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.540]   All the time.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.660]   --notice the angel?
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.300]   All the time.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:57.700]   I think it's one of the things that made me peculiar.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.020]   When I was in graduate school, I thought about--
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.140]   I had the thought of death in my mind all the time.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.380]   And I noticed that many of the people that I was with,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.980]   these were people I admired fine.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.100]   That wasn't part of their character.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.860]   But it was definitely part of mine.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.060]   I'd wake up every morning.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.020]   This happened for years.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.980]   Think, time's short.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.740]   Get at it.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.460]   Time's short.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.620]   Get at it.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.620]   There's things to do.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.620]   And so that was always-- it's still there.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.900]   And it's still there with--
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.060]   I would say, and it's unbearable in some sense.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.220]   Are you afraid of it?
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.580]   Like, what's your relationship?
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.260]   Afraid of death?
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:33.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:39.020]   You know, I was ready to die a year ago.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.420]   And not casually.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.500]   I had people I loved.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:49.420]   So no, I'm not very worried about me.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.100]   But I am very worried about making a mistake.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.580]   I heard Elon Musk talk about that a couple of months ago.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.860]   It was really a striking moment.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.100]   Someone asked him about death.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.180]   And he said, just offhand, and then went on
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.140]   with the conversation.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.420]   He said, that'd be a relief.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.780]   And then he went on with the conversation.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.220]   And I thought, well, you know, he's got a lot of weight
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.740]   on his shoulders.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.300]   I'm sure that part of him thinks,
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.100]   I'd be easier just if this wasn't here at all.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.460]   Now, he said it offhand.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.900]   But it was a telling moment, in my estimation.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:26.060]   So for him, that's a why live question.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.740]   The exhaustion of life.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.180]   If you call it life is suffering.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.220]   But the hardship.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.740]   I'm more afraid of hell than death.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:40.100]   You're afraid of the thing that follows.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.420]   I don't know if it follows or if it's always here.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.300]   And I think we're going to find out.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.180]   What's the connection between death and hell?
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.380]   I don't know.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.540]   I don't know.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.220]   I don't know.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.520]   Is there something that needs to be done before you arrive?
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.280]   You're more likely to die terribly
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.800]   if you live in a manner that brings you to hell.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.920]   That's one connection.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.280]   And terribly is a very deep kind of concept.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:16.240]   And that's the definition, by the way.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.880]   What do you make of Elon Musk?
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.520]   You've spoken about him a bit.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.020]   You met him.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.480]   I'm struck with admiration.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.560]   That's what I make of him.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.820]   And I always think of that as a primary--
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.980]   well, it's like, do you find this comedian funny?
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   It's like, well, I laugh at him.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.860]   It's not propositional again.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.620]   And so there are things I would like
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.060]   to ask Mr. Musk about.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.700]   The Mars venture.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.300]   I don't know what he's up to there.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.580]   It strikes me as absurd in the most fundamental sense.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.300]   Because I think, well, it'd be easier just
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.340]   to build an outpost in the Antarctica or in the desert.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.360]   Well, how much of the human endeavor is absurd?
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.960]   Well, that's what Nietzsche say.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.680]   Great men are seldom credited with their stupidity.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.640]   Who the hell knows what Musk is up to?
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.880]   I mean, obviously, he's building rockets.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.720]   Now, he's motivated because he wants
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.040]   to build a platform for life on Mars.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.640]   Is that a good idea?
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.360]   Who am I to say?
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.880]   He's building the rockets, man.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.760]   But I'd like to ask him about it.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.440]   I would like to see that conversation.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.440]   I do think that having talked to him quite a bit offline,
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.260]   I think these, several of his ideas, like Mars,
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.900]   like humans becoming a multi-planetary species,
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.580]   could be one of the things that human civilization
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:40.180]   looks back at as, duh, I can't believe he's one
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.740]   of the few people that was really pushing this idea.
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.620]   'Cause it's the obvious thing for society,
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.140]   for life to survive.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.580]   Yeah, well, it isn't obvious to me
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.620]   that I'm in any position to evaluate Elon Musk.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.860]   Like, I would like to talk to him
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.480]   and find out what he's up to and why,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.660]   but, I mean, he's an impossible person.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.460]   What he's done is impossible, all of it.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.600]   It's like, he built an electric car that works.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.000]   Now, does it work completely,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.280]   and will it replace gas cars, or should it?
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.720]   I don't know, but if we're gonna build electric cars,
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.260]   he seems to be the best at that, by a lot.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.780]   And he more or less did that, people carp about him,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.020]   but he more or less did that by himself.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.500]   I know he's very good at distributing responsibility
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.300]   and all of that, but he's the spearhead.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.180]   And then, that was pretty hard.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.660]   And then he built a rocket,
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.660]   at like 1/10th the price of NASA rockets.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.440]   And then he shot his car out into space.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.940]   That's pretty hard.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.060]   And then he's building this boring company,
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.220]   more or less as a, what would you call it?
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.540]   It's sort of, it's this whimsical joke in some sense,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.300]   but it's not a joke.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.340]   He's amazing.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.420]   - And Neuralink, delving into the depths of the mind.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.260]   - And Starlink, it's like, go Elon, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.100]   And then, he puts his finger on things so oddly.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.260]   The problem is underpopulation.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.580]   It's like, I think so too.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.260]   I think it's a terrible problem that we're,
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.900]   the West, for example, is no longer at replacement
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.020]   with regard to birth rate.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.420]   It means we've abandoned the virgin and the child
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.020]   in a most fundamental sense.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.900]   It's a bloody catastrophe.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.020]   And Musk, he sees it clear as can be.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.060]   It's like, wow.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.780]   And where everyone else is running around going,
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.140]   oh, there's too many people.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.900]   It's like, nope, got that.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.260]   Not only, see, I've learned that there are falsehoods
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.300]   and lies and there are anti-truths.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.100]   And an anti-truth is something that's so preposterous
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.660]   that you couldn't make a claim
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.700]   that's more opposite to the truth.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.980]   And the claim that there are too many people
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.820]   on the planet is an anti-truth.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.660]   So, you know, and people say,
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.100]   well, you have to accept limits to growth and et cetera.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.340]   It's like, I have to accept the limits
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.300]   that you're going to impose on me
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.740]   'cause you're frightened of the future.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.540]   That's your theory, is it?
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.380]   Okay.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.780]   - Well, it's an idea.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.100]   It could be a right idea.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.380]   It could be a wrong idea.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.020]   I think anti-truth.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.740]   Here, I'll tell you why it's the wrong idea, I think.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:18.660]   So imagine that there's an emergency, dragon.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.260]   There's a dragon.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.220]   Someone comes and says, there's a dragon.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.620]   I'm the guy to deal with it.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.180]   That's what the environmentalists say,
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.620]   the radical types who push limits to growth.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.540]   Then I look at them and I think, okay,
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.380]   is that dragon real or not?
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.700]   That's one question.
[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.220]   Well, is the-- - I ask that question
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.340]   of myself every time when I spend time alone.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.260]   - Is the apocalypse looming on the environmental front?
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.100]   Yes or no?
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.740]   I'll just leave that aside for the time being.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.660]   I think you can make a case both ways
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.460]   for a bunch of different reasons.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.660]   And it's not a trivial concern.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.100]   And we've overfished the oceans terribly.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.380]   And there are environmental issues that are looming large.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.940]   Whether climate change is the cardinal one or not
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.660]   is a whole different question, but we won't get into that.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.900]   That's not the issue.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.180]   You're clamoring about a dragon.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.460]   Okay, why should I listen to you?
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.340]   Well, let's see how you're reacting to the dragon.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   First of all, you're scared stiff and in a state of panic.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.780]   That might indicate you're not the man for the job.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.260]   Second, you're willing to use compulsion
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.380]   to harness other people to fight the dragon for you.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.980]   So now not only are you terrified,
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.260]   you're a terrified tyrant.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.580]   So then I would say, well, then you're not the Moses
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:39.300]   that we need to lead us out of this particular exodus.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.420]   And maybe that's a neurological explanation.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.020]   It's like, if you're so afraid of what you're facing,
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.900]   that you're terrified into paralysis and nihilism,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.300]   and that you're willing to use tyrannical compulsion
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.260]   to get your way, you are not the right leader for the time.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:57.580]   So then I like someone like Bjorn Lomborg or Matt Ridley
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.700]   or Marion Toupie, and they say,
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.100]   well, look, we've got our environmental problems.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:06.820]   And maybe there's a, you could make a case
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.100]   that there's a Malthusian element in some situations,
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.540]   but fundamentally the track record of the human race
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.500]   is that we learn very fast and faster all the time
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.020]   to do more with less, and we've got this.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.820]   And I think, yes to that idea.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.380]   And I think about it in a fundamental way.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.500]   It's like, I trust Lomborg, I trust Toupie,
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.300]   I trust Matt Ridley.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.100]   They've thought about these things deeply.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.220]   They're not just saying, oh, the environment doesn't matter,
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.060]   whatever the environment is.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.500]   You know, the environment, I don't even know what that is.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.620]   That's everything, the environment.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.420]   I'm concerned about the environment.
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.740]   Which is, how is that different than saying
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.580]   I'm worried about everything?
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.740]   How are those statements different semantically?
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.780]   - Well, yeah, the environment, it could be
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.940]   I'm worried about human society.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.540]   A lot of these complex systems are difficult to talk about
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.580]   because there's so much involved, for sure.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.900]   - Yeah, everything.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:14.100]   And then these models, 'cause people have gone after me
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.900]   'cause I don't buy the climate models.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.180]   Well, I think about the climate models
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.380]   as extended into the economic models
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.940]   because the climate model is,
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.860]   well, there's gonna be a certain degree of heating,
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.500]   let's say by 2100.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.860]   It's like, okay, some of that might be human generated,
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.660]   some of it's a consequence of warming after the Ice Age.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.180]   This has happened before, but fair enough.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.540]   Let's take your presumption,
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.700]   although there are multiple presumptions
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.780]   and any error in your model multiplies as time extends,
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.660]   but have it your way.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.620]   Okay, now we're gonna extend the climate model,
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.780]   so to speak, into the economic model.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.700]   So I just did an analysis of a paper by Deloitte,
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.740]   third biggest company in the US,
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.860]   300,000 employees, major league consultants.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.700]   They just produced a report in May.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.380]   I wrote an article for it in "The Telegraph,"
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.700]   which I'm gonna release this week on my YouTube channel.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.500]   Said, well, if we get the climate problem under control,
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.820]   economically, 'cause that's where the models
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.940]   are now being generated on the economic front,
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.300]   so now we have to model the environment, that's climate,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.580]   and we have to model the economy,
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.500]   and then we have to model their joint interaction,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.780]   and then we have to predict 100 years into the future,
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.660]   and then we have to put a dollar value on that,
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.340]   and then we have to claim that we can do that,
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.720]   which we can't, and then this is our conclusion.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.820]   We're going to go through a difficult period of privation,
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.700]   because if we don't accept limits to growth,
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.500]   there's gonna be a catastrophe 50 years in the future,
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.060]   or thereabouts, and so to avert that catastrophe,
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.820]   we are going to make people poorer now.
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.940]   How much poorer?
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.820]   Well, not a lot compared to how much richer
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.460]   they're going to be, but definitely,
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.140]   and they say this in their own models,
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.340]   definitely poorer, definitely poorer,
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.940]   than they would be if we just left them the hell alone.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:14.220]   And so then I think, okay, poorer, eh?
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.220]   Who?
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.140]   Well, let's look at it biologically.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:22.140]   Got a hierarchy, right, of stability and security.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.020]   That's a hierarchy, or one type.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.900]   You stress a hierarchy like that, a social hierarchy,
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   so there's birds in a environment,
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.660]   and an avian flu comes in, and then you look at the birds
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.300]   in the social hierarchy, and the low-ranking birds
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.540]   have the worst nests, so they're most exposed
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.940]   to wind and rain and sun, and farthest from food supplies,
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.300]   and most exposed to predators,
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.820]   and so those birds are stressed,
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.060]   which is what happens to you at the bottom of a hierarchy.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.220]   You're more stressed, 'cause your life is more uncertain.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.180]   You're more stressed, your immunological function
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.220]   is compromised because of that.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.500]   You're sacrificing the future for the present.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.940]   An avian flu comes in, and the birds die from the bottom up.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.620]   That happens in every epidemic.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.380]   You die from the bottom up.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.820]   Okay, so they say, when the aristocracy catches a cold,
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.980]   the working class dies of pneumonia.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.380]   All right, so now we're gonna make people poorer.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.460]   Okay, who?
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:23.020]   Well, we know who we make poorer when we make people poorer.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:27.180]   We make those who are barely hanging on poorer,
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.900]   and what does that mean?
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.380]   It means they die, and so what the Deloitte consultants
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.820]   are basically saying is, well, you know,
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.700]   it's kind of unfortunate, but according to our models,
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.620]   a lot of poor people are gonna have to die,
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.340]   so that a lot more poor people don't die in the future.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.460]   It's like, okay, hold on a sec.
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.060]   Which of those two things am I supposed
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.820]   to regard with certainty?
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.900]   The hypothetical poor people that you're gonna
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.860]   hypothetically save 100 years from now,
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.220]   or the actual poor people that you are actually
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.220]   going to kill in the next 10 years?
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.020]   Well, I'm gonna cast my lot with the actual poor people
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.820]   that you're actually going to kill.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.060]   And so, and then I think further.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.260]   It's like, well, okay, the Deloitte consultants,
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.180]   have you actually modeled the world,
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.620]   or is this a big advertising shtick
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.660]   designed to attract your corporate clients
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.900]   with the demonstration that you're so intelligent
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.300]   that you can actually model the entire ecosystem
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.100]   of the world, including the economic system,
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.500]   and predict it 100 years forward?
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.260]   And isn't there a bit of a moral hazard
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.340]   in making a claim like that?
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.220]   Just like, just a trifle, especially when,
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.100]   so I talked to Bjorn Lomborg and Michael Yon last week.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:47.100]   I accepted the UN estimates of starvation this coming year.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.220]   150 million people will suffer food insecurity.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.260]   Food insecurity.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.980]   Yeah, food insecurity.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.900]   That's the bloody buzzword.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.060]   Famine.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:03.140]   Well, Michael Yon thought 1.2 billion,
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.780]   and then that'll spiral, because he said,
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.580]   "What happens in a famine is that the governments
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.940]   "go nuts, crazy, the governments destabilize,
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:17.380]   "and then they appropriate the food from the farmers.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.700]   "Then the farmers don't have any money.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.780]   "Then they can't grow crops."
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.380]   And I think, yeah, that's exactly what they do.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.460]   That's exactly what would happen.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.540]   And so Yon told me 1.2 billion,
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.020]   and then Bjorn Lomborg said the same thing.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.060]   I didn't even ask him.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.180]   He just made it as an offhand comment.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.700]   So.
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:41.660]   - Let me ask you about the famine of the '30s.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.060]   - Yeah.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.460]   - Do you think-- - In Ukraine?
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.180]   - In the Ukraine. - Oh, yeah.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.180]   Fun, fun, fun.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.940]   - Similar, a lot of the things you mentioned
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.700]   in the last few sentences kind of echo
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.140]   to that part of human history.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.620]   - The hole in the door.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.300]   - Do you-- - No one knows about.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.740]   - Well, now I've just spent four weeks in Ukraine.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.300]   There's different parts of the world that still,
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.820]   even if they don't know, they know.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:09.860]   - Yeah, right.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.700]   - They feel history runs in the blood.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.940]   - The Dutch knew, in some sense.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.780]   They had a famine at the end of World War II,
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.420]   and part of the reason the Dutch farmers
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.300]   are so unbelievably efficient and productive
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.700]   is that the Dutch swore at the end of World War II
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.340]   that that was not going to happen again.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.620]   And then they had to scrape land out of the ocean,
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.220]   'cause Holland, that's quite a country.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.740]   It shouldn't even exist.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.140]   The fact that it's the world's number two exporter.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.140]   You know that it's the world's number two exporter
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.940]   of agricultural products, Holland.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:43.340]   It's like, I don't think it's as big as Massachusetts.
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.660]   It's this little tiny place.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.460]   It shouldn't even exist.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.380]   And they want to put, here's the plan.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.700]   Let's put 30% of the farmers out of business,
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.780]   while the broader ecosystem of agricultural production
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.460]   in Holland is 6% of their GDP.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.620]   Now, these centralizing politicians think,
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.540]   tell me if I'm stupid about this.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.780]   Take an industry.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:12.340]   You knock it back by fiat, by 30%.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.260]   Now it runs on like a 3% profit margin.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.460]   Now you're gonna kill 30% of it.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.580]   How are you not gonna bring the whole thing down,
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.900]   the whole farming ecosystem down?
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.180]   How are you not gonna impoverish the transport systems?
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.780]   How are you not gonna demolish the grocery stores?
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.420]   You can't take something like that
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:37.140]   and pare it back by fiat, by 30% and not kill it.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.420]   I can't see how you can do that.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.980]   I mean, look what we did with the COVID lockdowns.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.940]   We broke the supply chains.
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.580]   Tried buying something lately.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.540]   And wait, and aren't the Chinese
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.980]   threatening Taiwan at the moment?
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.740]   What are we gonna do without chips?
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.740]   So I don't know what these people are thinking.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:58.300]   And then I think, okay, what are they thinking?
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.540]   Well, the Deloitte people are thinking, aren't we smart?
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.940]   And shouldn't we be hired by our corporate employers?
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.860]   It's like, okay, too bad about the poor.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.740]   What are the environmentalists thinking?
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.100]   We love the planet.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.660]   It's like, do you?
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.620]   We love the poor, do you?
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.140]   Okay, let's pit the planet against the poor.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.980]   Who wins?
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.820]   The planet.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.140]   Okay, you don't love the poor that much.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.820]   Do you love the planet or do you hate capitalism?
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.260]   Let's pit those two things against each other.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.940]   Oh, well, it turns out we actually hate capitalism.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.500]   How can we tell?
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.460]   Because you're willing to break it.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.620]   And you know what's gonna happen.
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.020]   So what's gonna happen in Sri Lanka
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.020]   with these 20 million people who now have nothing to eat?
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.940]   Are they gonna eat all the animals?
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.540]   Are they gonna burn all the firewood?
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.580]   They're stockpiling firewood in Germany.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:48.380]   It's like, so is your environmental globalist utopia
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.780]   gonna kill the poor and destroy the planet?
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.260]   And that's okay, 'cause we'll wipe out capitalism.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.420]   It's like, okay.
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.900]   - Yeah, the dragon and the fear of the dragon
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.100]   drives ideologies, some of which can build a better world,
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.180]   some of which can destroy that world.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.500]   - Now, what do you think of that theory
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.420]   about trustworthiness?
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.540]   If the dragon that you're facing
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.060]   turns you into a terrified tyrant,
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.260]   you're not the man for the job.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.580]   Is that a good theory?
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:16.700]   - It's an interesting theory.
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.460]   Let me use that theory to challenge,
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.980]   because what does terror look like?
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.460]   Let me table the turns, turn the tables on you.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:32.180]   You are terrified, afraid, concerned about the dragon
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:41.820]   of something we can call communism, Marxism.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.180]   - Am I terrified of it?
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.060]   Am I terrified enough to be a tyrant?
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.860]   - Your theories had two components.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.220]   - Yeah, I'm not paralyzed.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.100]   - You had a dragon.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.300]   - Yeah, I'm not paralyzed, and I don't wanna be a tyrant.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:58.320]   - The tyrant part, I think, is missing with you.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.740]   But you are very concerned.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:05.740]   The intensity of your feeling does not give much space,
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:11.000]   actually, at least in your public persona,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.640]   for sitting quietly with the dragon
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   and sipping a couple of beers and thinking about this thing.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.460]   The intensity of your anger,
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.980]   concern about certain things you're seeing in society,
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.100]   is that going to drive you off the path
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.460]   that ultimately takes us to a better world?
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.780]   - That's a good question.
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.780]   I mean, I'm trying to get that right.
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.460]   So we've kind of come to a cultural conclusion
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.540]   about the Nazis.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.860]   Do you get to be angry about the Nazis?
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.760]   Seems the answer to that is yes.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.460]   - Well, actually, let me push back here.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.800]   I also don't trust people who are angry about the Nazis.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.140]   - I mean the actual Nazis.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:58.140]   - Well, as you know, there's a lot of people in the world
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:04.900]   that use actual Nazis to mean a lot of things.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:05.740]   - I know, I know.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.300]   - One of them is very important to me.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.460]   - Me, for example.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.300]   - Well, yes.
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.500]   - They use the, he's a Nazi.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.820]   Or magical super Nazi, as it turns out.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.140]   - I think they actually sort of
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.820]   steel man all their perspectives.
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.940]   I think a lot of people that call you a Nazi mean it.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.780]   - Yeah.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:23.900]   But like--
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:24.740]   - I'm aware of that.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.460]   - There's an important thing there though.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.980]   Because I went to the front in Ukraine.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.820]   - Yeah.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.820]   - And a lot of the people that lost their home,
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:38.460]   or their kind of, that got to interact a lot
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.260]   with the Russian soldiers, Ukrainian people
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.780]   that interacted with the Russian soldiers,
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.380]   they reported that the Russian soldiers
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:51.380]   really believe they're saving the people of Ukraine
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.780]   in these local villages from the Nazis.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.740]   - I understand, yeah.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:00.500]   - So to them, it's not just that the Ukrainian government
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.860]   has, or Ukraine has some Nazis.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.220]   It's like, it has been, the idea is that
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.140]   the Nazis have taken over Ukraine,
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.920]   and we need to free them.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.220]   This is the belief.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.820]   So this, again, Nazi's still a dragon that lives.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:16.660]   - Yeah.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.940]   - And it's used by people, because it's safe
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.060]   to sit next to that dragon and spread
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.680]   any kind of ideology you want.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.220]   So I just wanted to kind of say that we have agreed
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:32.220]   on this particular dragon, but I still don't trust
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.140]   anybody who uses that one.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.820]   - Yeah, but we have issues with boundaries, right?
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.660]   No, no, it's, so this is a very complicated problem, right?
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:45.380]   So René Girard believed that it was a human proclivity
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.620]   to demonize a scapegoat and then drive it
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.460]   out of the village.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.780]   And I've thought about that a lot.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.480]   We need a place to put Satan.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.880]   Seriously, this is a serious issue.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.280]   - Should he be inside the village or outside?
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.080]   - Well, maybe he should be inside you, right?
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.680]   That's the fundamental essence of the Christian doctrine.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.920]   It's like, Satan is best fought on the battleground
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.000]   of your soul.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.180]   And that's, that's right.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.640]   It's right.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.680]   - Can you actually put words to the kind of dragon
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.520]   that you're fighting?
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.440]   Is it communism?
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.680]   - It's the spirit of Cain, yeah.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:30.700]   - Can you elaborate what the spirit of Cain is?
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:36.200]   - So after Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.680]   for becoming self-conscious, or when they become
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.740]   self-conscious, they're destined to work.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.600]   And the reason for that, as far as I can tell,
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.280]   is that to become self-conscious is to become aware
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.160]   of the future, is to become aware of death.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:53.440]   That certainly happens in the Adam and Eve story,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.080]   to have the scales fall from your eyes.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.960]   And then the consequence of that is that you now
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.520]   have to labor to prevent the catastrophes of the future.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.640]   That's work.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.480]   Work is sacrifice.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.000]   Sacrifice of the present to the future.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.240]   It's delay of gratification, it's maturity.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.220]   It's sacrifice to something as well,
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:17.540]   and in the spirit of something.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:21.840]   Okay, so now Adam and Eve have two children,
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.760]   Cain and Abel.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.720]   So those are the first two people in history,
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.120]   because the Garden of Eden doesn't count.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.080]   And they're the first two people who are born
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.000]   rather than created.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.680]   So they're the first two people.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.260]   And that's a hell of a story, because it's a story
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.680]   of fratricidal murder that degenerates
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.640]   into genocide, flood, and tyranny.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   So that's fun for the opening salvo of the story, let's say.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.760]   And Abel and Cain both make sacrifices.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.280]   And for some reason, Abel's sacrifices please God.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   It's not exactly clear why.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.160]   And Cain's don't.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.460]   Now, there's an implication in the text
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.020]   that it's because Cain's sacrifices are second rate.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.920]   God says that Abel brings the finest
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.640]   to the sacrificial altar.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.320]   He doesn't say that about Cain.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.720]   So you could imagine that Cain is sacrificing away,
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.440]   but he's holding something in reserve.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.360]   He's not all in.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.800]   He's not bringing his best to the table.
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.200]   He's not offering his best to God.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.680]   And so Abel thrives like mad.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.720]   And everyone loves him.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:28.720]   And he gets exactly what he needs and wants,
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.000]   exactly when he needs and wants it.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.880]   He's favored of God.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.160]   And Cain is bearing this terrible burden forward
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.440]   and working.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.320]   And his sacrifices are rejected.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:45.520]   So he gets resentful, really resentful,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.280]   enough resentful enough to call God out and say something
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.680]   like, this is quite the creation you've got going here.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.200]   I'm breaking myself in half, and nothing good's coming my way.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.520]   What the hell's up with that?
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.880]   And then there's Abel, the sun shining on him every day.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.960]   How dare you?
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.360]   OK, but this is God that Cain's talking to.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.640]   And so God says what Cain least wants to hear,
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.120]   which is what God usually says to people.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:21.040]   He says, look to your own devices.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.200]   You're not making the sacrifices you should.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.440]   And you know it.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.840]   And then he says something even worse.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.880]   He says, sin crouches at your door
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.640]   like a sexually aroused predatory animal.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:41.600]   And you've invited it in to have its way with you.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:45.520]   And so he basically says, you have allowed your resentment
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.600]   to preoccupy yourself.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.320]   And now you're brooding upon it and generating
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.840]   something creative, new, and awful,
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.280]   possessed by the spirit of resentment.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.440]   And that's why you're in the miserable state you're in.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.040]   So then Cain leaves.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.160]   His countenance falls, as you might expect.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.600]   And Cain leaves, and he's so incensed by this.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:11.680]   Because God has said, look, your problems are of your own making.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.760]   And not only that, you invited them in.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.480]   And not only that, you engaged in this creatively.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.760]   And not only that, you're blaming it on me.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.160]   And not only that, that's making you jealous of Abel,
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.480]   who's your actual idol and goal.
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:28.600]   And Cain, instead of changing, kills Abel.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.520]   Right?
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.920]   And then Cain's descendants are the first people
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:35.440]   who make weapons of war.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.320]   And so that's-- OK, you want to know what I think?
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.520]   That's the eternal story of mankind.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:47.000]   And it's playing out right now, except at 1,000 times the rate.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.320]   Can I present to you a difficult truth?
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.200]   Perhaps not a truth, but a thought I have.
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.880]   That it is not always easy to know which among us are the Cain.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.120]   That's for sure.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.680]   And resentment.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.720]   It is possible to imagine you as the person who
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:17.040]   has a resentment towards a particular world view
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.080]   that you really worry about.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.720]   Yeah, well, I talked to a good friend of mine
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.440]   last week about that publicly.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.120]   We'll release it.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.720]   So I said, well, do I have a particular animus
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.400]   against the left, let's say?
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   He's like, well, probably.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.440]   OK, why?
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.520]   Well, first of all, I'm a university professor.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.880]   It's not like the universities are threatened by the right.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.160]   They're threatened by the left, 100%.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.000]   And they're not just threatened a little bit.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.680]   They're threatened a lot.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.680]   And that threat made it impossible for me
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.120]   to continue in my profession the way I was.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.600]   And it cost me my clinical practice, too.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.240]   And that's not over yet, because I have 10 lawsuits against me
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.240]   out right now from the College of Psychologists,
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.200]   because they've allowed anyone to complain about me,
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.800]   anywhere in the world, for any reason,
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.520]   and have the choice to follow that up
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.120]   with an investigation, which is a punishment in and of itself,
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.320]   and are doing so.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.400]   And then I've been tortured nearly to death multiple times
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.520]   by bad actors on the left.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.600]   Now, I've had my fair share of radical right-wingers being
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.400]   unhappy with what I've said.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.040]   But personally, that's been the left the whole time,
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.800]   not only me, but my family.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.480]   Put my family at risk in a big way, and constantly.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.960]   Like, not once or twice, because many people
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.120]   get canceled once or twice.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.680]   But I've been canceled like 40 times.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   And I know like 200 people now who've been canceled.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.400]   And I can tell you without doubt that it
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.160]   is one of the worst experiences of their life.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.960]   And that's if it only happens once.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.600]   And so-- and then I also know that the communists killed
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.080]   100 million people in the 20th century,
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.800]   that the intellectuals excused them for it nonstop,
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.560]   and still haven't quit, that almost no one knows about it,
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.200]   and that the specter of resentful Marxism
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.040]   is back in full force.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.120]   And so do I have a bit of an animus against that?
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:22.960]   Yes.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.040]   Does it go too far?
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360]   I don't know.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.760]   I'm trying to figure that out.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.320]   The story you just told, it seems nearly impossible
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.680]   for you, an intellectual powerhouse,
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.360]   not to have a tremendous amount of resentment.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.040]   Well--
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.080]   And this is the--
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.080]   so let me challenge you.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.160]   Yeah, go right ahead, man.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.080]   Let me challenge you.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:47.960]   Can you steal, man, the case that the prime minister
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.440]   of this country, Trudeau, wants the power
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.240]   wants the best for this country, and actually
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.840]   might do good things for this country,
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.440]   as an intellectual challenge?
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.240]   Sure.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.480]   He seems to get along well with his wife.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.040]   He has some kids.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.680]   There's no sexual scandals.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.800]   And he's in a position where that could easily be the case.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.120]   He seems to have done some good things on the oceanic
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.760]   management front.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.040]   He's put a fair bit of Canada's oceans
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.440]   into marine protected areas.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.920]   And that might be his most fundamental legacy,
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.120]   if it's real.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.580]   I've been trying to get information
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.380]   about the actual reality of the protection.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.040]   And I haven't been able to do that.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.160]   But that's a good thing.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.120]   So sorry, the family thing is--
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.800]   It speaks to his character.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.600]   It's his character.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.200]   There is some aspect to him that makes him a good man,
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:38.760]   in that sense.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.720]   I mean, there's the evidence there.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.400]   I mean, he's not a Jeffrey Epstein profligate
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.520]   on the sexual front.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.400]   So that's something.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.900]   And his wife, they seem to have a real marriage.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.900]   And he has kids, so good for him.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.160]   That's a good start, by the way, for a leader.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:54.960]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.720]   To be a good man.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.240]   Well, then I also thought, OK, well,
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.040]   after the Liberals had brought in a Harvard intellectual who
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.120]   was a Canadian to be their last leader, he didn't work out.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.320]   And then they're flailing about for a leader.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.500]   And the Liberals in Canada are pretty good at maintaining
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.360]   power and leadership, and have been the dominant governing
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.600]   party in Canada for a long time.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.960]   And so they went to Justin and said, well, you know,
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.720]   it's you or a Conservative.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.200]   And you can imagine that's not a positive specter for someone
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.480]   who's on the left, or even a Liberal.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.040]   And Trudeau is quite a bit on the left.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.400]   And they said, we need you to run.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.600]   And then I thought, OK, well, the answer to that
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.000]   should have been no, because Trudeau, Justin,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.520]   has no training for this, no experience.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.200]   He's not-- he's a part-time drama teacher, fundamentally.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.320]   He hadn't run a business.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.160]   He just didn't know enough to be prime minister.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.520]   But then I'm trying to put myself in his position.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.880]   So it's like, OK, I don't know enough, but I'm young.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.800]   And we don't want the Conservatives.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.480]   And they had had a run, a 10-year run,
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.880]   so maybe it was time for a new government.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.560]   Maybe I could grow into this man.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.880]   Maybe I could surround myself with good people,
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.960]   and I could learn humbly.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.920]   And I could become the person I'm now pretending to be,
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.680]   which we all have to do as we move forward, right?
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.920]   And so then I thought, OK, I think
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.080]   you made a mistake there, because you ran only
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.080]   on your father's name.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.600]   And you didn't have the background.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.240]   But let's give the devil his due and say, that's no problem.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.000]   OK, so now what do you do?
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.440]   Well, you get elected.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:42.480]   And your first act is to make the cabinet 50% women,
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.080]   despite the fact that only 25% of the elected members
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.040]   are female.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.520]   It's like, OK, you just halved your talent pool.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.920]   That was a really bad move for your first move.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.000]   - Can I ask you about that?
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.880]   Do you think-- where does that move come from?
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.480]   Deep somewhere in the heart?
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:06.760]   Or is it trying to listen to the social forces of the moment
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.680]   and try to ride those ways towards maybe greater
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.160]   and greater popularity?
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.960]   - By after thinking it through.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.800]   It's like, no, you just halved your talent pool
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.080]   for cabinet positions.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   That's what you did.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.080]   There's enough cabinet positions.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.240]   You could argue that each of them met threshold.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.040]   It's like, there is a big difference
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.920]   between threshold and excellent.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.040]   - So you don't think that came from a place of compassion?
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.120]   - I don't care if it did.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   I don't regard compassion as a virtue.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.000]   Compassion is a reflex, not a virtue.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.240]   Judicious compassion is a virtue.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.800]   - Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.600]   Compassion can come deep from the human heart
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.160]   and the human mind, I think.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.400]   Are we talking about the same kind of compassion?
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:48.600]   - Yes.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.800]   - Trying to understand the suffering--
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.360]   - Treating adults like infants is not virtuous.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.040]   - I see.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.080]   Well, compassion isn't treating adults like--
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.560]   I mean, those are just terms.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.280]   - Are you sure?
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.000]   - Whatever the term is, maybe love is maybe the better word.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.520]   - Edible compassion is?
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.520]   - I mean, I suppose I'm speaking to love.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.320]   You don't think those ideas came from concern?
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.600]   - Love is compassion.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.680]   - You don't think those--
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.920]   - Love is a blend of compassion and encouragement and truth.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.520]   Love is complicated, man.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.160]   - Yeah, it has a lot of good things in it, yes.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.680]   - If I love you, is it compassion or encouragement
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.600]   you want from me?
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.440]   - Yeah, the dance.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.080]   Love is definitely a dance of two humans,
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.120]   ultimately, that leads to the growth of both.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:32.960]   - Well, that's the thing.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.720]   The growth element is crucial.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.560]   Because the growth element, to foster the growth element,
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.080]   that requires judgment.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.840]   Compassion and judgment, well, even,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.880]   and have been conceptualized this way forever,
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.720]   two hands of God, mercy and justice.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.880]   They have to operate in tandem, right?
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:55.880]   And mercy is, flawed as you are, you're acceptable.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.480]   It's like, well, do you want that?
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.080]   Do you want your flaws to be acceptable?
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.320]   And the answer to that is no.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.240]   It's like, well, that's where the judgment comes in.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.440]   It's like, but you could be better.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.280]   You could be more than you are.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.000]   And that's the maternal and the paternal
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.880]   in some fundamental sense.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   And there has to be a active exchange of information
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.280]   between those two poles.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   So even if Trudeau was motivated by compassion,
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.600]   and it's like, yeah, just how loving are you, first of all?
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.080]   No, it was a really bad decision.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.920]   And then he's expressed contempt for monetary policy.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.560]   I'm not interested in monetary policy.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.560]   It's like, okay, but you're a prime minister.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.880]   And he's expressed admiration for the Chinese Communist
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.200]   Party, because they can be very efficient
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.160]   in their pursuit of environmental goals.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.600]   It's like, oh yeah, efficiency, eh?
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.120]   The efficiency of the tyranny in the service of your terror.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.240]   And so, and I've watched him repeatedly,
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.720]   and I've listened to him a lot,
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.040]   and I've tried to do that clinically
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.760]   and with some degree of dispassion.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.800]   And that's hard too, because his father, Pierre,
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   devastated the West in 1982 with the national energy policy.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.160]   And Trudeau is doing exactly the same thing again.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.840]   And so as a Westerner as well, I have an inbuilt animus
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.600]   and one that's well-deserved, because Central Canada,
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.320]   especially the glittery, literati elite types
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.480]   in the Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto triangle
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:39.480]   have exploited the West and expressed contempt
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.960]   for the West far too much for far too long.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.360]   And that's accelerating at the moment, for example,
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:48.880]   with Trudeau's recent attack on the Canadian farmers.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.480]   He's an enemy of the oil and gas industry,
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.840]   which is an utter and absolute bloody catastrophe.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.720]   And look what's happened in Europe,
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.680]   at least in partial consequence.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.000]   And he's no friend to the farmers.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.160]   So I've tried to steel man him.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.600]   I try to put myself in the position of the people
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.320]   that I'm criticizing.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.920]   I think he's a narcissist.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:15.280]   - Do you think there's a degree to which power changed him?
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.360]   - If you're not suited for the position,
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.760]   if you're not the man for the position,
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.720]   you can be absolutely 100% sure
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.040]   that the power will corrupt you.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.080]   How could it not?
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.720]   I mean, at the least, if you don't have the chops
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.760]   for the job, you have to devalue the job
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.000]   to the point where you can feel comfortable inhabiting it.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.880]   So yes, I think that it's corrupted him.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.960]   And I mean, look at him doubling down.
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.360]   We wear masks in flights into Canada.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.280]   We have to fill out an arrive can bureaucratic form
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.160]   on our phones because a passport isn't good enough.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.640]   We can't get a passport.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.320]   What if you're 85 and you don't know
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.960]   how to use a smartphone?
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.280]   Oh well, too bad for you.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.120]   It's like, yes, it's corrupted him.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.240]   - Would you talk to him?
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.000]   If you were to sit down and talk with him
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.640]   and he wanted to talk,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:13.440]   would you and what kind of things would you talk about?
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.840]   Perhaps on your podcast.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   - I don't think I've ever said no to talking to anyone.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.160]   So which is, you know.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.040]   - Would that be a first?
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.360]   Or would you make that conversation?
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.280]   Do you believe in the power of those kinds of contacts?
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.040]   - No, if he was willing to talk to me,
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.720]   I'd talk 'cause I'd like to ask him.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.480]   I have lots of things I'd like to ask him about.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.280]   I mean, I've had political types in Canada on my podcast
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.880]   and tried to ask them questions.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.400]   So I'd like to know.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   You know, maybe I've got a big part of him wrong.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.240]   - Yes.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.640]   - And I probably do.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.160]   But my observation has been that every chance
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.080]   he had to retreat from his pharaonic position,
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.400]   let's say he doubled down.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.160]   And these, our parliament is not running for the next year.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.640]   It's still Zoom in.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:06.160]   It's still COVID lockdown parliament.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   For the next year, it's already been fatally compromised,
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:16.840]   perhaps, by the lockdowns for the last couple of years.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.080]   This is parliament we're talking about.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.280]   - Yeah, there's a kind of paralysis,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.720]   fear-driven paralysis that also, in part,
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.240]   some of the most brilliant people I know
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.960]   are lost in this paralysis.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.360]   I don't think people assign a word to it,
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.440]   but it's almost like a fear of this unknown thing
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.920]   that lurks in the shadows.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.640]   And that, unfortunately, that fear is leveraged by people
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:47.120]   that, you know, who aren't in academic circles,
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.880]   who aren't faculty or students and so on,
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.360]   are more in administration.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.520]   And they start to use that fear,
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.280]   which makes me quite uncomfortable.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.000]   It does lend people in the positions of power
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.080]   who are not good at handling that power
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.080]   to become slowly, day by day, a little bit more corrupt.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.080]   - I was really trying to figure out, you know,
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.680]   the last two weeks, thinking this through.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.080]   It's like, how do you know?
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.680]   Let's say someone asked me a question
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.520]   in the YouTube comment.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.720]   He said, "Why can I trust your advice
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.200]   "on the environmental front?"
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.560]   And I thought, "That's a really good question."
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.560]   Okay, let's see if we can figure out
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.240]   the principles by which the advice would be trustworthy.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.520]   Okay, how do you know it's not trustworthy?
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.520]   Well, one potential response to that would be
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.120]   the claims are not in accordance with the facts.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.840]   But, you know, facts are tricky things,
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.400]   and it depends on where you look for them.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.520]   So that's a tough one to get right,
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.920]   because, for example, Lomberg's fundamental critics
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.120]   argue about his facts, not just his interpretation of them.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.000]   So that can't be an unerring guide.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.760]   And so I thought, well, the facts exactly doesn't work,
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.280]   'cause when it's about everything, there's too many facts.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.840]   So then how do you determine if someone's a trustworthy guide
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.440]   in the face of the apocalyptic unknown?
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.360]   'Cause that's really the question.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.400]   And the answer is, they're not terrified tyrants.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.520]   I think that's the answer.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.520]   Now, maybe that's wrong.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.960]   If someone has a better answer, hey-
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.880]   - How do you know if they're a terrified tyrant?
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.720]   That's the problem. - 'Cause they're willing
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.880]   to use compulsion on other people
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   when they could use goodwill.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.800]   Like the farmers in Canada objected.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.640]   They said, "Look, we have every economic reason
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.140]   "to use as little fertilizer as we can,
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.720]   "'cause it's expensive.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.880]   "We have satellite maps of where we put the fertilizer.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.000]   "We have cut our fertilizer use so substantially
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.080]   "in the last 40 years, you can't believe it,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.240]   "and we grow way more food.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.840]   "We're already breaking ourselves in half."
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.240]   And if you know farmers,
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.960]   especially the ones who still survive,
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.600]   you think those people don't know what they're doing.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.600]   It's like, they're pretty damn sophisticated, man.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.840]   Like way more sophisticated than our prime minister.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.800]   And now you tell them, "No, it's a 30% reduction,
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.760]   "and we don't care how much food you're growing."
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.240]   So it's not a reduction that's dependent
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.760]   on amount of food produced per unit of fertilizer used,
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.560]   which would be, at least you could imagine it.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.240]   So, okay, so you're producing this much food,
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.700]   and you use this much fertilizer, so you're hyper-efficient.
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.400]   Maybe we take the 10% of farmers
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.160]   who are the least efficient in that metric,
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.420]   and we say to them, "You have to get as efficient
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.680]   "as the average farmer."
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.640]   And then they say, "Well, look,
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.760]   "our situation's different.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.600]   "We're in a more northern clime.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.160]   "The soil's weaker."
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.160]   You know, you obviously have to bargain with that,
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.200]   but at least you reward them for their productivity.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.480]   Well, it's like, "Well, Holland isn't gonna have beef."
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.200]   Well, where are they gonna get it?
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.320]   "Well, you don't need it."
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.160]   It's like, "Oh, I see.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.520]   "You get to tell me what I can eat now, do you?
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.460]   "Really?
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.440]   "Okay.
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:08.900]   "And Holland is gonna import food from where
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:12.540]   "that's more efficient on the fertilizer front?
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.900]   "There's no one more efficient than Holland.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.460]   "Same with Canada?
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.460]   "And isn't this gonna make food prices more expensive?
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:24.080]   "And doesn't that mean that hungry people die?
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.980]   "'Cause that is what it means."
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.740]   - So, ultimately, poor people pay the price
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.740]   of these kinds of policies.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.920]   - Not known, not ultimately.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.420]   - Today. - Now.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.260]   - Today.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.900]   - Today, that's a crucial distinction,
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   because they say, "Well, ultimately, the poor will benefit."
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:43.220]   Yeah, except the dead ones.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.980]   - Yes, today.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.300]   - Today, right.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.420]   - It seems like the story of war, too,
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:52.620]   is a time when the poor people suffer
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:56.540]   from the decision made by the powerful, the rich,
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.740]   the political elite. - Yeah, 'cause they can just leave.
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.980]   - Yeah.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.360]   Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.160]   - Oh, yeah, I got into plenty of trouble about that, too.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:12.220]   - You're just a man in a suit,
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:16.700]   talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.740]   There's also people dying, fighting.
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.700]   It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.420]   This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:30.180]   It's people trying to ask, they have many dragons,
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.460]   and they're asking themselves the question,
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:37.340]   who are we, what is this, what is the future of this nation?
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.180]   We thought we are a great nation,
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.180]   and I think both countries say this,
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.020]   and they say, "Well, how do we become
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.100]   "the great nation we thought we are?"
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:50.940]   - Yeah.
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:55.140]   - First of all, you got in trouble.
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:58.060]   What's the dynamics of the trouble?
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.740]   Something you regret saying. - Well, it wasn't that much.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.660]   No, no, I thought about it a lot.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.140]   I laid out four reasons for the war,
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.820]   and then I was criticized in "The Atlantic"
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:12.020]   for the argument was reduced to one reason,
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.300]   which was a caricature of the reason.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.260]   I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.920]   Mismanagement on the part of the West
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.540]   in relationship to Russia and foreign policy
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.580]   over the last, since the wall fell.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.100]   It's understandable 'cause it's extremely complex.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:34.060]   Hyper-reliance on Russia as a cardinal source
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.980]   of energy provision for Europe
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:39.660]   in the wake of idiot environmental globalist utopianism.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:45.660]   The expansionist tendencies of Russia
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:48.800]   that are analogous in some sense
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.260]   to the Soviet Union empire building.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.180]   And then the last one, which is the one
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:57.460]   I got in trouble for, which is Putin's belief
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:01.260]   or willingness to manipulate his people into believing
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.900]   that Russia is a salvific force
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.860]   in the face of idiot Western woke-ism.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.460]   And that's the one I got in trouble for.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.060]   It's like, while you're justifying Putin, it's like,
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.780]   it's not only the Russians
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.140]   that think the West has lost its mind.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.220]   The Eastern Europeans think so too.
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.140]   And do I know that?
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.620]   It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:28.900]   this spring and I talked to 300 political
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.780]   and cultural leaders and you might say,
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:31.980]   well, they were all conservatives.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.300]   It's like, actually, no, they weren't.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.860]   Most of them were conservatives 'cause it turns out
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.100]   that they're more willing to talk to me.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.260]   But a good chunk of them were liberals
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:46.060]   by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.780]   And a fair number of them were canceled progressives.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:51.860]   - Well, because you're very concerned
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:56.860]   about the culture wars that perhaps are a signal
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:02.340]   of a possible bad future for this country
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:06.300]   for this part of the world, that reason stands out.
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:11.300]   And do you sort of looking back at four reasons,
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:16.300]   think it deserves to have a place in one of the four?
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.740]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:20.460]   Because it is, you know, it's a-
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.180]   - Well, the four was bifurcated, eh?
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:24.300]   Because I said, look, Putin might believe this.
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.820]   And I actually think he does.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.500]   'Cause I read a bunch of Putin's speeches
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.660]   and I have been reading them for 15 years.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.460]   And my sense of people generally,
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.620]   and this was true of Hitler, it's like,
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.580]   what did Hitler believe?
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.900]   Well, did you read what he wrote?
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.020]   He just did what he said he was going to do.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.380]   And you might think, well, some people are so tricky.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:47.140]   They have a whole body of elaborated speech
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.820]   that's completely separate from their personality
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.740]   and their personality is pursuing a different agenda.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.980]   And this whole body of speech is nothing but a front.
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:00.180]   It's like, good luck finding someone that sophisticated.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.940]   First of all, if you say things long enough,
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:02.900]   you're going to believe them.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.820]   - That's a really interesting and fascinating
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.980]   and important point.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.660]   Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda,
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.620]   I think Hitler is an example of somebody
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.020]   that I think really quickly,
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.100]   you start to believe the propaganda.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:19.300]   - Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.860]   It's like, don't you become what you practice?
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.900]   And the answer to that is, well, absolutely.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.420]   We even know the neurology.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.460]   It's like when you first formulate a concept,
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:32.060]   huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so to speak.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:34.740]   But as you practice that, first of all,
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.740]   the right hemisphere stops participating.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:40.660]   And then the left participates less and less
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.940]   until you build specialized machinery
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:45.860]   for exactly that conceptual frame.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:49.100]   And then you start to see it, not just think it.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.380]   And so if you're telling the same lies over and over,
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.660]   who do you think you're fooling?
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:56.460]   Think, well, I can withstand my own lies.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.420]   Not if they're effective lies.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.380]   And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people,
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.460]   and then they reflect them back to you,
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.620]   what makes you think you're going to be able
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.220]   to withstand that?
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.060]   You aren't.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:12.140]   And so I do think Putin believes,
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.660]   to the degree that he believes anything,
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.260]   I do believe that he thinks of himself
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:20.740]   as a bulwark for Christendom
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:23.580]   against the degeneration of the West.
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.660]   And that's that third way that Dugin and Putin
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:29.380]   have been talking about, the philosopher Alexander Dugin
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.060]   and Putin for 15 years.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.580]   Now, what that is is very amorphous.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:38.260]   Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians would have to return
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:42.660]   to the incremental development of Orthodox Christianity
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.020]   to escape from the communist trap.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.900]   And to some degree that's happened in Russia
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.500]   'cause there's been a return to Orthodox Christianity.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.820]   Now you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox Church
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.980]   has just been co-opted by the state.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:56.020]   And I would say there's some evidence for that.
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:23:01.020]   I've heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns,
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:03.220]   now I don't know if this is true,
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.340]   owns $5 billion worth of personal property.
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.060]   And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.700]   And it's possible that the Orthodox Church
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.220]   has been co-opted, but there has been somewhat
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.460]   have an Orthodox revival in Russia.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.580]   And I don't think that's all bad.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.540]   Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this,
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.180]   if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.180]   and unfortunately, I don't think that's true.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.660]   I've read his speeches.
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.460]   It doesn't look like it to me.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.820]   And he is by no means the worst Russian leader
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:36.220]   of the last hundred years.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.380]   - Well, there's quite a selection there.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.780]   - There certainly is.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.660]   But, and I say that knowing that,
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.920]   even if he doesn't believe it,
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:51.500]   he's convinced his people that it's true.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:56.500]   And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.860]   And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.860]   - Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.100]   And a lot of people have reached out to me,
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:11.860]   experts telling me how I should feel,
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.020]   what I should think about Ukraine.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:18.340]   Oh, you naive, Lex, you're so naive.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.340]   Here's how it really is.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:24.100]   But then I get to see people that lost their home.
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:28.260]   I get to see people on the Russian side who believe they're,
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:31.060]   I genuinely think that there's some degree
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.500]   to which they have love in their heart.
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:37.660]   They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:41.380]   - How else would you motivate young men to go fight?
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:45.740]   - It's just, it's these humans destroying
[01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:49.580]   not only their homes, but creating generational hate,
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:52.780]   destroying the possibility of love towards each other.
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.700]   They're basically creating hate.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:59.500]   What I've heard a lot of is on February 24th of this year,
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:04.260]   hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:06.740]   Hate towards not Vladimir Putin,
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.380]   hate towards not the soldiers in Russia,
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:12.020]   but hate towards all Russians.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:15.380]   Hate that will last generations.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:20.380]   And then you can see just the pain there.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:26.900]   And then when all these experts talk about
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:32.900]   agriculture and energy and geopolitics,
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:36.820]   and yeah, maybe like what you say
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:41.360]   with fighting the ideologies of the woke and so on,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.660]   I just feel like it's missing something deep
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:50.660]   that war is not fought about any of those things.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.940]   - War started and war is averted based on human beings,
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.860]   based on humanity.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.820]   - Here's another ugly thought
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.820]   since we haven't had enough so far.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:07.700]   We locked everything down for COVID.
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:10.700]   How much face-to-face communication was there
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.060]   between the West and Vladimir Putin?
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.500]   How about none?
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:17.020]   How about that was the wrong amount?
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.420]   Especially given that Europe was completely dependent
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.180]   on Putin for its energy supplies.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.540]   Well, not completely, but you know what I mean.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.940]   Materially and significantly.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.660]   So maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:31.780]   Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble, probably.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.300]   - And not just an information bubble,
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.380]   how all these experts tell me about.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.100]   - Yeah, no, a human bubble.
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:39.220]   - Human bubble.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.260]   - Look, one of the things I've really learned,
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:44.300]   there's a real emphasis on hospitality in the Old Testament.
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:46.980]   I just brought all these scholars together
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.100]   to talk about Exodus.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.860]   Hey, I have this security team with me,
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:53.740]   and they're tough military guys,
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:57.220]   but they're on board for this mission, let's say.
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.620]   And so they went out of their way
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:01.420]   to be hospitable to my academic guests.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.340]   They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:07.260]   They spent all day preparing this house I had rented
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.820]   so that we could have a hospitable time with these scholars,
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.140]   most of whom I didn't know well,
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.460]   but who said they would come and spend eight days
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.420]   talking about this book with me.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.700]   We rented some jet skis.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.020]   We had a nice house.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.660]   We had fun.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.820]   We got to know each other, and we got to trust each other
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.620]   because we could see that we could have some fun
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.380]   and that we could let our hair down a bit.
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.860]   We didn't have to be on guard,
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.780]   and that made the talks way deeper.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.660]   And then we found out we couldn't get through Exodus
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.380]   in eight days, and so I had proposed very early on
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:38.780]   that we're gonna double the length.
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.020]   And so I pulled eight people out of their lives
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.860]   for eight days.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.940]   That's not an easy thing to do.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:46.300]   It's also quite expensive,
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.060]   and the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.940]   And they said, "Yes, right away."
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.900]   Said, "We'd love to do this again."
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:54.900]   Well, why?
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.460]   Well, partly because intellectually,
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.700]   it was unbelievably engaging.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:27:59.540]   I learned so much.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.540]   It'll take me like a year to digest it
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.380]   if I can ever digest it.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:08.420]   But they had a really good time.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.020]   And so when they were offered that combination
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:14.420]   of intellectual challenge, let's say, in hospitality,
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:15.540]   it was a no-brainer.
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.580]   They just said, every one of them said,
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.220]   "If I can do it in any way, I will definitely be there."
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:24.060]   And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times,
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:26.100]   and the culture of hospitality
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.260]   has broken down in Washington.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.580]   40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.100]   They don't have apartments.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.100]   Their family isn't there with them.
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.580]   They don't have social occasions
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.420]   with their fellow Democrats or Republicans,
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.020]   much less across the table.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.980]   And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:48.420]   that were bilateral a couple of times,
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.460]   get young Republican congressmen
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:52.700]   and Democrats together to talk.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:53.940]   And as soon as they talk, they think,
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:57.100]   "Oh, it was so interesting, 'cause one of the lunches
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:01.260]   was about 15 people, half Democrats and half Republicans,
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:03.780]   and all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:06.260]   talking about why you decided to become a congressman,
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.460]   which is not a job I would take, by the way.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:12.860]   You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.820]   Your family isn't there with you.
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:17.660]   You have to run for re-election every two years.
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:20.580]   You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.540]   You're vilified constantly.
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:24.980]   This is not, you know, people think,
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.780]   "Well, this is a job for the privileged."
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:29.660]   It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:30.900]   and find out how much fun it is
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.060]   and put your family on the line
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.180]   and then have to beg for your job every two years
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:37.060]   while your enemies, the worst of your enemies
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:41.300]   and the worst of your friends are viciously hen-pecking you.
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:43.500]   And so anyways, we had them all sit around a table,
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:47.700]   said, "Okay, just say why you ran for Congress."
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:49.460]   It was so cool, especially for a Canadian,
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.660]   'cause you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.060]   It's something to watch.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:56.100]   It was like Mr. Smith goes to Washington
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:56.940]   for every one of them.
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:59.260]   It's like, "Well, this country has given us so much.
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.660]   Our families have been so,
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:05.300]   we've benefited so much from our time here.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.780]   We think this is a wonderful country.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.180]   We really felt that we should give back."
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.460]   Then the next one would talk
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.180]   and it was like exactly the same story.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:13.460]   And then it didn't matter
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:14.740]   if they were Republican or Democrat,
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.740]   you couldn't tell the difference.
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:16.900]   No one could.
[01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:17.900]   And was it genuine?
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.220]   It's like, "Well, are you genuine?
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:23.140]   You think these people are worse than you?"
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.220]   First of all, they're not.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.660]   Second of all, they're probably better,
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.180]   all things considered.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.740]   It's not that easy to become a congressman.
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.180]   And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:37.020]   but by and large, you walk away from your meetings
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.620]   with these people and you think,
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:42.020]   pretty impressive.
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.180]   - They really are giving a part of themselves
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.540]   in the name of service.
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:48.180]   Maybe over time, they become cynical
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:52.780]   and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.180]   But I think a lot of it-
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:55.620]   - Could you imagine that?
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.260]   - Is healed, I think.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.900]   And I don't think I'm,
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.340]   well, I'm in part naive, but not fully,
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:05.500]   that a lot of it is healed through the power of conversation,
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.180]   just basic social interaction.
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.660]   I do think that the-
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:10.500]   - You bet, man.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.940]   - The effects of this pandemic-
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:12.820]   - By listening.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:15.460]   - Listen, just sitting there.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.980]   And it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:21.620]   It's actually humor and all those kinds of things
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:23.940]   about personal struggles,
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:26.260]   all those kinds of things that remind you
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:28.620]   that you're all just humans.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:31.180]   - Yeah, well, the great leaders that I've met,
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:32.700]   'cause, and I've met some now,
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.100]   they go listen to their constituents.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.380]   It's not a policy discussion.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.660]   It's not an ideology discussion.
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:42.220]   They go say, "Okay, what's your life like?
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:43.540]   "And what are your problems?
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.780]   "And tell me about them."
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.980]   And then they listen, and then they're struck by them.
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.780]   And then they gather up all that misery
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:52.300]   and they bring it to the congressional office
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.220]   or to the parliament.
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:57.700]   And they think, "Here's what the people are crying out for."
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.620]   And the good leaders, that's a leader.
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:01.700]   Leader listens.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:06.860]   So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy,
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:11.860]   and he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour,
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.380]   being funny, that's hard.
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.460]   He said, "Comedy is the most, stand-up comedy,
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:20.780]   "which is what I do in some real sense.
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:23.380]   "It's a thing I do that it's most akin
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.720]   "to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.460]   "It's the closest analog."
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.820]   He said, "It's the most dialogical enterprise."
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.380]   And I thought, "Why, what do you mean?"
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.220]   'Cause see, it's just the monologue.
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:36.260]   And it's a prepared monologue.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:39.900]   I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:40.980]   while you're telling your jokes
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:42.060]   and you gotta get the timing right,
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:44.700]   but you have a body of jokes.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:47.220]   He said, "Well, here's how you prepare the jokes."
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:49.500]   And I've been told this by other comedians.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.620]   You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:55.300]   and you got some new material and you think it's funny.
[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.580]   And you go into a club and you lay out your new material
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.540]   and people laugh at some of it.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:04.580]   And you pay attention to what they laugh at
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.380]   and what they don't laugh at.
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:09.060]   So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.380]   and you get rid of everything that isn't funny.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.560]   And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:17.200]   the crowd will tell you what's funny.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.060]   So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.360]   and each is an hour long and you collect two minutes
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.500]   of humor from each show.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:28.000]   So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.860]   more than 98% of it, collect two minutes per show.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.260]   So you're not very funny at all.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:35.860]   You're like funny 2% of the time.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:38.820]   You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:41.420]   So that's what a leader does.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.140]   That is what a leader does, is goes out
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.900]   and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.900]   And then I do think that's revivifying
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:52.080]   to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.500]   because then the person can say to themselves,
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:56.860]   "Despite the inadequacies of the system
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:01.540]   and my inadequacies, I'm gathering up the misery
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:04.660]   and the hope and I'm bringing it forward
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:06.500]   where it can be redressed."
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:07.500]   - Giving it a voice.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.380]   - Yep, giving it, that's right, giving it a voice.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.820]   - Can you actually take me through a day,
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:14.620]   'cause this is fascinating, through your comedy tour.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:19.580]   What does a day in the life of Jordan Peterson look like?
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:22.500]   Which is this very interesting day.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.740]   Let's look at the day when you have to speak.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.460]   Preparing your mind, thinking of what you're going
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:33.460]   to talk about, preparing yourself physically, mentally
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:37.260]   to interact with the crowd through the actual speaking.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.780]   How do you adjust what you're thinking through
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:41.740]   and how do you come down from that
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:46.540]   so you can start all again as a limited biological system?
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:51.300]   - Well, I'm usually up by seven
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:55.660]   and ready to go by 7.30 or eight.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.820]   - Coffee?
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:00.460]   - No, steak and water.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.460]   - How many times a day, steak?
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.780]   - All, that's all I eat.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:05.060]   - How many times?
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.220]   - Three or four, depending on the day.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.060]   - Steak and water.
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.500]   - Steak and sparkling water.
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.820]   Yeah, so monastic asceticism, man.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.940]   - Well, I did the proper, I usually eat just once a day.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.420]   I did the proper Jordan Peterson last night
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:20.580]   and just ate two steaks.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.940]   - And how was that?
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.140]   - It was wonderful.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.540]   - Yeah, well, if you have to only eat one thing,
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:27.780]   could be worse.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.660]   So anyways, I'm ready to go at eight
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.180]   because we're generally moving.
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:33.380]   - What does moving mean?
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:34.620]   - Flying. - You're constantly--
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:35.940]   - Flying somewhere.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:36.780]   - Okay.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:38.860]   - And we usually use private flights now
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:41.620]   because the commercial airlines aren't reliable enough
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:44.780]   and you cannot not make a venue, right?
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.580]   So that's rule number one on a tour.
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:48.900]   You make the show.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:53.060]   So everything, and then rule number two is
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.740]   anybody who causes any trouble on the tour is gone.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:59.380]   Because there is zero room for error.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:04.300]   Now, no, there's zero room for unnecessary,
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.300]   unaddressed error.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:06.580]   So there's gonna be errors.
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.100]   The guys I have around me now,
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:12.060]   if they make a mistake, they fix it right away.
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:13.700]   So, and that's great.
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:15.820]   - There's a lot of people relying on you to be there,
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.660]   so you have to be there.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.900]   - Yeah, like 4,000 people typically.
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:24.900]   So then I'm on the plane and I usually write,
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:31.100]   or often, because there's no internet on the plane
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:32.500]   and that's a good use of time.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.860]   So I'm writing a new book, so I write on the plane.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.260]   - Typing or handwriting?
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.940]   - Typing, yeah, typing.
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:43.580]   And then we land and we go to,
[01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:46.020]   it's usually early afternoon by then,
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:47.340]   we go to a hotel.
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:48.780]   It's usually a nice hotel.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.460]   It's not corporate, I don't really like corporate hotels.
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:54.700]   My secretary and one of my logistics guys
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:59.220]   has got quite good at picking kind of adventurous hotels,
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:00.260]   boutique hotels.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.740]   They're usually in the old parts of the city,
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.980]   especially in Europe, somewhere interesting.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:08.940]   And so we go there and then lunch usually.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.660]   And sometimes that's an air fryer and a steak
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.500]   in the hotel room.
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.500]   And I leave a trail of air fryers behind me
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.020]   all across the world.
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:19.980]   And then Tammy and I usually go out
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.580]   and have a walk or something and take a look at the city.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.140]   And then I have a rest for like an hour and a half
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.340]   or an hour, half an hour.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.180]   - Like a nap or just--
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:29.420]   - Yeah, nap, I have to sleep for 20 minutes.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.460]   And that's about all I can sleep,
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:31.780]   but I need to do that in the late afternoon.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:32.940]   - And that refreshes your mind.
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:35.060]   - Yeah, that gives me, that wakes me up again
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.380]   for the evening.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.260]   And then Tam has to sleep longer.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:40.180]   She's still recovering from her illness.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.500]   And so she has to sleep longer in the afternoon.
[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.380]   And that's absolutely necessary for both of us
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.580]   or things start to get frayed.
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:48.940]   And so then we go to the venue.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:54.660]   And then I usually sit for an hour.
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:56.940]   If I'm gonna lecture, I've been doing a lot of Q and A's
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.860]   and that's a little easier.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:01.060]   But if I'm gonna lecture, I have to sit for an hour.
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.300]   And then I think, okay,
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:07.580]   what question am I trying to investigate?
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:09.700]   I have to have that, that's the point.
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:13.140]   What mystery am I trying to unravel?
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:15.620]   It's usually associated with one of the rules in my book
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.700]   because technically it's a book tour,
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.700]   but each of those rules is an investigation into an ethic.
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:24.580]   And each of them points to a deeper sort of mystery
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.420]   in some sense.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:28.820]   And there's no end to the amount it can be explored.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.820]   And so I have the question.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.620]   My question might be something like,
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:36.740]   put your house in perfect order
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:38.460]   before you criticize the world.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.780]   Okay, what does that mean exactly?
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.300]   What does house mean?
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:46.780]   What does put mean, that active verb?
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:48.980]   What does perfect in order mean?
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:51.300]   Why before you criticize the world?
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.940]   What does it mean to criticize?
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:54.700]   What does it mean to criticize the world?
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:56.860]   How can you do that properly or improperly?
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:59.340]   So I start to think about how to decompose the question.
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:02.180]   - And you start to think which of these decompositions
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.780]   are important to really dig into.
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.060]   - Yeah, well, then they'll strike me.
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.380]   It's like, okay, there's something there
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:09.100]   that I've been maybe noodling around on
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.140]   that I would like to investigate further.
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.700]   Then I think, okay, how can I approach this problem?
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:16.220]   I think, well, I have this story that I know,
[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.900]   I have this story and I have this story,
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:19.940]   but I haven't juxtaposed them before.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.940]   And there's gonna be some interesting interaction
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.420]   in the juxtaposition.
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:24.820]   So I have the question
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:27.540]   and I kind of have a framework of interpretation.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:31.100]   And then I have some potential narrative places I can go.
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.300]   And then I think, okay, I can go juggle that
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.140]   and see what happens.
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:38.820]   And so then what I wanna do is concentrate on that process
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.340]   while attending to the audience
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.540]   to make sure that the words are landing
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:45.060]   and then see if I can delve into it deeply enough
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:50.060]   so that a narrative emerges spontaneously with an ending.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:53.420]   Now, I'm sure you've experienced this in podcasts, right?
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:56.100]   Maybe I'm wrong, but my experience has been
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:58.420]   if I fall into the conversation
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.820]   and we know about the timeframe,
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:03.660]   there'll be a natural narrative arc.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.180]   And then, so you'll kind of know when the midpoint is
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.100]   and you'll kind of see when you're reaching a conclusion.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.380]   And then if you really pay attention,
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.060]   you can see that's a good place to stop.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.340]   And it's kind of, you come to a point
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:20.220]   and you have to be alert and patient to see that.
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.340]   And you have to be willing to be satisfied
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:24.180]   with where you've got to.
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:26.700]   But if you do that, and then it's like a comedian
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:28.740]   making the punchline work.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.260]   It's like, I've got all these balls in the air
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:33.820]   and they're going somewhere
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:36.380]   and this is how they come together.
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:37.700]   And people love that, right?
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.140]   To say, oh, this and this and this and this and this,
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.700]   whack, together.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.660]   And that's an insight.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.980]   And it is very much like a punchline.
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:47.820]   - Well, that's interesting because your mind,
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.860]   actually, I'm a fan of your podcast too.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:53.380]   And you are always driving towards that.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:57.060]   I would say for me in a podcast conversation,
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:00.700]   there's often a kind of Alice in Wonderland
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.260]   type of exploration.
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:03.540]   - Down the rabbit hole, man.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.180]   - And then you just, a new thing pops up.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.820]   The more absurd, the wilder, the better.
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.500]   Conversations with Elon are like this.
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:11.340]   - Yeah, I bet.
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:14.180]   - Actually, the more you drive towards an arc,
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.340]   the more uncomfortable you start to get
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:19.740]   in a fun, absurd conversation because,
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.420]   oh, I'm now one of the normies.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:23.460]   No, I don't want that.
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:25.700]   I want to be, I want the rabbit.
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.340]   I want the crazy.
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.740]   Because it makes it more fun.
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:32.060]   But somehow throughout it,
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:35.940]   there is wisdom that you try to grasp at,
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:37.540]   such that there is a thread to the thing.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.580]   - Well, that's the thing, man.
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.300]   You're following the thread, eh?
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.140]   - Yeah.
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:41.980]   - The drive.
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:42.940]   - Well, that's right.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:45.460]   That's what we're trying to do, that thread.
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.180]   That thread is the proper balance
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:49.060]   between structure and spontaneity.
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:52.140]   And it manifests itself as the instinct of meaning.
[01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:54.740]   And that's the logos in the dialogos.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:55.940]   And it really is the logos.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.700]   And God only knows what that means.
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:01.100]   You know, I mean, the biblical claim is that logos
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.700]   is the fundamental principle of reality.
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.660]   And I think that's true.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.860]   I actually think that's true.
[01:42:07.860 --> 01:42:10.540]   'Cause I think that that meaning that guides you,
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:11.740]   well, here's a way of thinking about it.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:14.180]   I've been writing about this recently.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.100]   What's real?
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.060]   Matter.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:19.140]   It's like, okay, that's one answer.
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:20.060]   What's real?
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:23.060]   What matters is real.
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.860]   'Cause that's how you act.
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:26.780]   Okay, so that's different than matter.
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:31.580]   It's like, okay, what's the most real of what matters?
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.700]   How about pain?
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:36.340]   Why is it the most real?
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:37.940]   Try arguing it away.
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:40.060]   Good luck.
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.940]   So pain is the fundamental reality.
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:44.780]   All right.
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:47.700]   Well, that's rough.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:50.100]   Doesn't that lead to nihilism and hopelessness?
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.820]   Yeah, doesn't it lead to a philosophy
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.780]   that's antithetical towards being?
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.860]   The most fundamental reality is pain.
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:59.780]   Yes.
[01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:02.020]   Is there anything more fundamental than pain?
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.500]   Love.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:07.380]   Really?
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:09.420]   If you're in pain,
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:14.900]   love and truth,
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:18.140]   that's what you got.
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:19.020]   And you know,
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:26.740]   if they're more powerful than pain,
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.580]   maybe they're the most real things.
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:33.660]   When you think about reality, what is real
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:36.140]   that is the most real thing?
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.500]   Well, it's a tough one, right?
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.340]   'Cause you have to, 'cause if you're a scientist,
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.900]   a materialist, think, well,
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:44.980]   the matter is the most real.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:47.500]   It's like, well, you don't know what the matter is.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:49.740]   And so, and then when push comes to shove,
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:53.100]   and it will, you'll find out what's most real.
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:53.940]   Yeah.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:59.220]   I feel like this is missing,
[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:03.540]   the physical reality is missing some of the things.
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:05.980]   So of course, pain has a biological component
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:06.860]   and all those kinds of things,
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:10.660]   but it's missing something deep about the human condition
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:15.260]   that at least the modern science is not able to describe.
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:17.260]   But it is reaching towards that.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:18.100]   Yeah, it is.
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:21.100]   And it's the reason, one way to describe it
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:23.700]   as you're describing is the reason it's reaching it
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:27.380]   is because underneath of science is this assumption
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:30.500]   that there's a deep--
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.980]   Logos.
[01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:34.780]   Thing to this whole thing we're trying to do.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:36.580]   Well, you know, there's two traditions, right?
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.540]   In some sense, there's two logos traditions.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:44.340]   There's the Greek rational enlightenment tradition.
[01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:45.780]   That's a logos tradition.
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:48.460]   And it insists that there's a logos in nature
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.660]   and that science is the way to approach it.
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.540]   And then there's a Judeo-Christian logos,
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:55.100]   which is more embodied and more spiritual.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.180]   And I would say the West is actually an attempt
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:59.020]   to unite those two.
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.620]   And it's the proper attempt to unite those two
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:04.860]   because they need to be united.
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:07.460]   And I see the union coming in your terms.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:09.660]   You know, I talked to friends to all, for example,
[01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:13.380]   about the animating principle of chimpanzee sovereignty.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.220]   And that's pretty close biologically.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.780]   Is it power?
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:19.340]   Because that's the claim even from the biologists often.
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:23.620]   The most dominant chimp has the best reproductive success.
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:26.780]   It's like, oh yeah, dominant, eh?
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:28.300]   You mean using compulsion?
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.900]   Okay, let's look.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:34.580]   Are the chimps who use compulsion the most successful?
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:39.060]   And the answer is sporadically and rarely.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:41.420]   And for short, well, that's sporadically,
[01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:42.980]   for short periods of time.
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.020]   Why?
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:46.660]   Because they meet an unpleasant end.
[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:52.380]   The subordinates over whom they exercise arbitrary control
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:56.020]   wait for a weak moment and then tear them into shreds.
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:56.900]   Right?
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:59.300]   Every dictator's terror.
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:00.500]   And for good reason.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:04.420]   And de Waal has showed that the alpha chimps, the males,
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:07.300]   who do have preferential mating access often,
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:12.020]   are often and reliably the best peacemakers
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.100]   and the most reciprocal.
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:16.580]   And so even among chimps, the principle of sovereignty
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:21.580]   is something like iterated reciprocity.
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:26.820]   And that's a way better principle than power.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:28.700]   And it's something like, I've been thinking,
[01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:31.580]   what's the antithesis of the spirit of power?
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:33.460]   I think it's the spirit of play.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.460]   And you know, I don't know what you think about that,
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:39.580]   but when you have a good podcast conversation,
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:41.900]   you already described it in some sense as play.
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.380]   It's like there's a structure, right?
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:45.900]   'Cause it's an ordered conversation.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:48.140]   But you want there to be play in the system.
[01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:51.340]   And if you get that right, then it's really engaging.
[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:54.860]   And then it seems to have its own narrative arc.
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.060]   I'm not trying to impose that,
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:58.140]   even though that's another thing I don't do.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:01.300]   I didn't come to this conversation at all thinking,
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.580]   here's what I want out of a conversation with Lex Friedman.
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:08.860]   Like instrumentally, I thought, I'll go talk to Lex.
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:09.700]   Why?
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:13.140]   I like his podcasts.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.500]   He's doing something right.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:15.820]   I don't know what it is.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:17.940]   He asks interesting questions.
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.780]   I'll go have a conversation with him.
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:20.900]   Where's it gonna go?
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:23.460]   Wherever it goes.
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:26.340]   - Embracing the spirit of play.
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:30.020]   So what you have this, when you're lecturing,
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:32.060]   you're going in front of the crowd,
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:36.380]   you thought of a question, you get on the stage.
[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:38.260]   First of all, are you nervous at all?
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:43.020]   - I'm very nervous when I'm sitting down,
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:46.020]   thinking through the structure initially,
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:49.020]   which is why my wife and I have been doing Q&As,
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:50.820]   and that's easier on me.
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:54.460]   - It's the way comedians are nervous.
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:59.180]   Like Joe Rogan just did his special this weekend.
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:02.580]   And so he now has to sit nervously,
[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:05.060]   like a comedian does, which is like,
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:07.020]   I have no material now.
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:07.860]   - Right.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:08.700]   - I have to start from scratch.
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.780]   - When I was doing the lectures constantly
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:14.820]   instead of the Q&As, basically what I was doing
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:17.780]   was writing a whole book chapter every night.
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:20.300]   And you know, now that's a bit of an exaggeration
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:22.660]   'cause I would return to themes that I had developed,
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.500]   but it's not really an exaggeration
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:29.380]   because I didn't ever just go over wrote material, ever.
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:34.540]   So it's very demanding and that part's nerve wracking
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.420]   'cause I sit down, it's an hour before the show,
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:41.020]   and I think, can I do this?
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:45.020]   And you know, the answer is, well, you did it 1000 times,
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:46.580]   but that's not this time.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:47.420]   - Yeah.
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.140]   - It's like, can I come up with a question?
[01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.260]   Can I think through the structure?
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:56.140]   Can I pull off the spontaneous narrative?
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.420]   Can I pull it together?
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:00.060]   And the answer is, I don't know.
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:02.660]   And so then I get it together in my mind, I think,
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:05.780]   and that's hard, it takes effort and it's nerve wracking.
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:08.660]   Okay, I got it, but then there's the moment
[01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:10.300]   you go out on stage and you think,
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:13.420]   well, I know I had it, but can I do it?
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.180]   No notes.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.620]   And then the question is, well, you're gonna find out,
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:18.860]   well, you do it.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:21.020]   And so then I go out on stage
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:24.380]   and I don't talk to the audience.
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:26.580]   I talk to one person at a time.
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:29.540]   And you can talk to one person, you know,
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:30.500]   'cause you know how to do that.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.380]   So I talk to a person and not too long
[01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:33.820]   'cause I don't wanna make them too nervous.
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:35.900]   And then someone else and someone else,
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:37.940]   and then I'm in contact with the audience.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:41.060]   And then I can tell if the words are landing
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:43.620]   and I listen, it's like, are they rustling around?
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:46.060]   Are they dead quiet?
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:47.580]   'Cause you want dead quiet.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:51.420]   - Oh, I see, that's what focus sounds like.
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.420]   You're in it together then.
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:54.260]   - You bet.
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:55.620]   Well, and I also, here's a good rule
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.660]   if you're learning to speak publicly.
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:49:59.100]   I never say a word
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:04.540]   till everyone is 100% quiet.
[01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:06.620]   And that's, it's a great way to start a talk
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:08.900]   because you're set in the frame, eh?
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.540]   And if the frame is, well, I'll talk while you're talking,
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:14.380]   the message is, well, you can talk.
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:16.180]   This is a place where everybody can talk.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.860]   It's like, no, it's not.
[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:21.180]   This is a place where people paid to hear me talk.
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:24.020]   So I'm not gonna talk till everyone's listening.
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:26.980]   And so then you get that stillness,
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.180]   and then you just wait
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:30.820]   'cause that stillness turns into an expectation.
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:34.420]   And then it comes, turns into a kind of nervous expectations
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:35.940]   like what the hell is he doing?
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.140]   It's not manipulative.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:38.700]   It's a sense of timing.
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:41.060]   It's like, just when that's right, you think,
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:42.940]   okay, now it's time to start.
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:44.340]   - Well, that nervous, the interesting thing
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:46.180]   about that nervous expectation
[01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:49.380]   is from an audience perspective, we're in it together.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.220]   - Yeah.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:51.540]   - I mean, there is, into that silence,
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:53.100]   there's a togetherness to it.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:55.420]   - Of course, it's the union of everyone's attention.
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:56.260]   - Yeah.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:58.420]   - Yeah, and that's a great thing.
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:50:59.900]   I mean, you love that at a concert
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.700]   when everyone, it's not silence then,
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.900]   but when everyone's attention is unified
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.260]   and everyone's moving in unison,
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:09.260]   it's like we're all worshiping the same thing, right?
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:11.460]   And that would be the point of the conversation,
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:13.660]   the point of the lecture.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:16.620]   And the worship is the direction of attention towards it.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:19.220]   And it's communion because everyone's doing it
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:20.620]   at the same time.
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.260]   And so, I mean, there's not much difference
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.620]   between a lecture theater and a church in that regard, right?
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:28.460]   It's the same fundamental layout and structure.
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:30.940]   And they're very integrally associated with one another.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.220]   One really grew out of the other.
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.300]   The lecture theater grew out of the church.
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:36.300]   So it's perfectly reasonable
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:38.540]   to be thinking about it in those terms.
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:42.180]   And so, and then, okay, so after the lecture,
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:45.580]   we play a piece of music that is a piece of music
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:47.980]   that I've been producing with some musicians
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:51.020]   for a couple of books I'm gonna release in the fall.
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:53.780]   Terrible books, "ABC of Childhood Tragedy,"
[01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:57.180]   they're called, dark, dark books,
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:02.340]   dark and comical books, terrible books,
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:05.260]   heartbreaking illustrations.
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:07.620]   We set them to music.
[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:09.420]   And so we play a piece from that.
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:13.580]   And then afterwards, I usually meet about 150 people
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:14.540]   to have photographs.
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:17.220]   And so each of those is a little-
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.980]   - Is there a little sparkle of a human connection?
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:22.460]   - A lot, a lot.
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:26.460]   It's very intense, 10 seconds with every person.
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:28.620]   You think, well, how can 10 seconds be intense?
[01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.860]   It's like, pay enough attention.
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:33.260]   It gets intense real quick.
[01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:36.900]   - Does it break your heart to say goodbye so many times?
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:39.220]   - It's like being in a wedding lineup,
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.220]   at a wedding that you wanna be at,
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.820]   and everybody's dressed up.
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:45.300]   And that's so weird, 'cause I bought these expensive suits
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:47.660]   when I went on tour, and it broke my heart
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:48.940]   'cause I spent so much money on them.
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:51.380]   I thought, God, that's completely unconscionable.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:55.460]   I thought, no way, man, I'm in this 100%.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:58.820]   And so I'm gonna dress with respect.
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:03.820]   And like 60% of the audience comes in
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:05.900]   two or three piece suits.
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.460]   They're all dressed up.
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.260]   Then there's this line to greet me,
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:11.220]   and they're all happy to see me.
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:13.420]   That's not so hard to take,
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:15.060]   although it is in a sense, right?
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:19.020]   Because normal interactions are pretty shallow.
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:21.020]   And you think, I don't want shallow interactions.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.580]   It's like, yes, you do most of the time.
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:24.500]   - It's intense.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.700]   - It's very intense.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.540]   - And I don't know if you--
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:28.300]   - But you've had a taste of this, no doubt,
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:29.140]   'cause people recognize you.
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:33.300]   - Yeah, but I also have, when a person recognizes me,
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:37.380]   and they come with love, and they're often brilliant people,
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:39.860]   one of the thoughts I have to deal with,
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:42.460]   one of the dragons in my own mind is,
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:44.340]   you know, thinking that I don't deserve
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:45.900]   that kind of attention.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:46.740]   And so--
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.220]   - Well, you probably don't.
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:50.940]   - Right, I don't. - But maybe you could.
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:53.060]   - It's a burden in that I have to step up
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:56.260]   to be the kind of person that deserves that,
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:58.220]   not deserves that, but in part deserves
[01:53:58.220 --> 01:53:59.100]   that kind of attention.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.300]   And that's like, holy shit.
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.580]   - It's crucially important too,
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:05.220]   because if someone comes up to you in an airport,
[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:06.100]   and they know who you are,
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.980]   and they're brave enough to admire you,
[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:11.260]   or who you are attempting to be,
[01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:16.260]   and you make a mistake, they will never forget it.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:17.220]   - Yeah.
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.380]   - So it's a high stakes enterprise.
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.220]   - And the flip side of that, especially with young people,
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.500]   a few words you can say can change the direction
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:26.460]   of their life. - Yeah.
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:28.180]   One way or another.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:30.340]   And so I really have to watch this too in airports,
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:31.700]   'cause I do not like airports.
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:34.620]   I do not like the creeping totalitarianism in airports.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.860]   They've always bothered me.
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:36.700]   - Yes.
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:38.420]   - They really bother me.
[01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:40.980]   And I'm an unpleasant travel companion for my wife
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:42.060]   sometimes because of that.
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.140]   Although I think we've worked that out, thank God,
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:46.460]   'cause we're doing a lot of traveling.
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:50.940]   But most of the security guards and the border personnel,
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:52.380]   all those people, they know me.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:55.700]   And as a general rule, they're positively predisposed to me.
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.780]   And so if I'm peevish or irritable,
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:55:02.380]   then, well, that's not good.
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.540]   It's not good.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:05.260]   And so that's a tight rope to walk too,
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:08.580]   because I do not like that creeping totalitarianism.
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:09.940]   But by the same token,
[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:13.820]   if you're just one of the crowd,
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:18.340]   sometimes it's good just to be one of the crowd,
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.540]   and then you're a little irritable,
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:21.060]   and people can just brush that off.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:26.060]   But if you're someone they have dared to open their heart to,
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:28.020]   'cause that's what admiration is,
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:32.220]   and then you betray that,
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:35.660]   then that's a real, they'll never forget it.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.140]   And then they'll tell everyone too.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:41.140]   So it takes a lot of alertness.
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:43.380]   And so Tammy and I, our life has got complicated,
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:45.380]   'cause in Toronto, for example,
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:48.300]   we can't really just go for a walk.
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.780]   It's always a high drama production,
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:52.500]   'cause always people come up
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:56.020]   and they have some heart-rending story to tell.
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:58.060]   And I'm not being cynical about that.
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:01.980]   It's a hard thing to bear,
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:03.740]   because people don't do that.
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:05.900]   They don't just open themselves up to you like that
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.700]   and share the tragedy of their life.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:12.620]   But that's an everyday occurrence.
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:14.540]   And so when we go up to our cottage,
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:18.140]   which is out of the city, it's a relief,
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:22.300]   because as wonderful as that is,
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:23.900]   like it's a weird, I have a weird life,
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:26.620]   because everywhere I go, it's very weird.
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:29.140]   It's like I'm surrounded by old friends,
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:32.300]   'cause I walk down the street in any city now, virtually,
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:35.300]   and people say, "Hello, Dr. Peterson, so nice to see you."
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:36.940]   Or they say better things than that.
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:38.740]   Very rarely bad things.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:42.740]   One experience in 5,000 maybe, very rare,
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:44.860]   although you don't forget those either.
[01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:47.500]   But it's very strange.
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:51.460]   - And there's an intimacy, they know you well,
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:54.540]   and because they leap into,
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:57.500]   they avoid the small talk often.
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:58.700]   - They leap into familiarity.
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:00.900]   It really is like it's an old friend,
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:01.860]   and it feels like that.
[01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:06.500]   For me personally, the experience is the goodbye hurts,
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:09.860]   because there's a sense
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:11.580]   where you're never gonna see that friend again.
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:14.380]   - Right, yeah, that's a strange thing, eh?
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:19.380]   - So to me, a lot of it just feels like goodbyes.
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:22.540]   - Well, and it is.
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:23.380]   You're right about that.
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:26.700]   And I mean, that's, I suppose, in some sense,
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.500]   part of the pain of opening yourself up to people,
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.060]   because they also, Tammy has been struck particularly.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:35.420]   She said, "I really never knew what men were like."
[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.900]   I said, "Well, what do you mean?"
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:41.020]   She said, "I cannot believe how polite the men are
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:42.580]   "when they come and talk to you,
[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:43.860]   "'cause it's always the same.
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:45.540]   "The pattern's very similar.
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:47.100]   "The person comes up, they're mostly men,
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:49.100]   "not always, but mostly.
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:51.620]   "And they're tentative, and they're very polite,
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:53.540]   "very, very polite."
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.500]   And they say, "I hope I'm not bothering you.
[01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:59.100]   "Do you mind that I say that they're not bothering me,
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:02.140]   "and I'm doing everything I can
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:04.460]   "to not be the guy who's bothered by that."
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:05.860]   It's like, who do you think you are?
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:07.500]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.460]   - You're the guy that, what, is famous,
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:12.140]   and now is above that?
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:13.260]   - Yeah.
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:15.300]   - You don't wanna be that guy.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:17.780]   So you wanna be grateful all the time
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:20.540]   when people open up like that.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:23.260]   And so you gotta be alert and on point
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:25.180]   to do that properly, like right away,
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:27.940]   'cause for you, it's five seconds,
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:30.140]   or 10 seconds, or 20 seconds, whatever it is.
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:33.980]   But for them, they've opened up,
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:37.540]   and so you can really nail them if you're foolish.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:40.660]   - After the 150 people, how do you come down from that?
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:44.620]   How do you find yourself again?
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:48.420]   - Well, that was often when I got caught in Twitter traps,
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:50.500]   'cause I'm so burnt out by then
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:55.020]   from the talk and the audience interactions,
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:57.180]   and the whole day, 'cause it's a new city,
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:59:00.820]   it's a new hotel, it's a new 5,000 people,
[01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:04.220]   it's a new book chapter, it's a whole new horizon of ideas,
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:06.740]   and it's off to another city the next day.
[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:10.740]   I'm so burnt out by then that I'm not as good
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:13.500]   at controlling my impulses as I might be,
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.340]   and Twitter was a real catastrophe for that,
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.500]   'cause it would hook me, and then I couldn't,
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:20.820]   like I used to, when I was working on my book a lot,
[01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.260]   I used to call Tammy, I'd say,
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:25.340]   "Look, you have to come and get me, I can't stop.
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:26.220]   "I can't stop."
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:28.900]   I got tired of it, 'cause it's part
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:31.660]   of a kind of hypomanic focus.
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:32.740]   I couldn't quit.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.580]   It's like, "Oh no, I'm still writing.
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:37.260]   "I need to get away from this," but I couldn't stop.
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:42.260]   And so it's better to read something, a book.
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:46.100]   - Fiction, nonfiction?
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:47.460]   - Fiction.
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:50.260]   Stephen King, I was reading a lot of Stephen King
[01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:52.420]   when I was on tour last time, that was good.
[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:53.260]   I like Stephen King a lot.
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.580]   - So great narratives.
[01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:56.460]   - Great, and great characterization.
[01:59:56.460 --> 02:00:02.900]   And there's a familiarity about Stephen King's writing too,
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:05.340]   that he writes about people you know.
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:08.100]   And so I really found that a relief.
[02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:10.300]   And so that was useful.
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:12.940]   And that in order to tolerate this, let's say,
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:14.340]   or to be able to sustain it,
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.740]   well, that's taken a lot of negotiation
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:17.860]   on the part of Tammy and I,
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.260]   because she's dragged into this,
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:25.100]   and her life is part of this, whatever this is.
[02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:28.420]   And she's had to find her way, and has.
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:30.460]   For example, now she has a different hotel room
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:32.380]   than me when we travel.
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:35.380]   And she found that she didn't wanna be on the tour
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.940]   this spring, and I was ill again for part of it,
[02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:39.060]   and that made it complicated.
[02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:42.180]   But she went away back home, and she came back,
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:43.420]   and she said, and she was nervous about it.
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:45.420]   She said, "I think I need my own room."
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.140]   And part of me was not happy with that.
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:48.540]   It's like, what do you mean you need your,
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:50.380]   like, are we not married anymore?
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:52.420]   It's like, you need your own room?
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:54.900]   And she said, "Well, you know, I can't."
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:57.300]   She has to do exercises because she was really sick,
[02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:59.900]   and she has to keep herself in shape.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:02.220]   And she has to have some time to do that.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:03.820]   She does a lot of prayer and meditation,
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.940]   and she needs the time, and she has her own podcast,
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.860]   which is going quite well, and she needs the time.
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:11.500]   And I trust her, and she said, "Well, I need this
[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:12.460]   "in order to continue."
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:15.180]   And I thought, well, okay.
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:19.020]   If you need this in order to continue, yes.
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.300]   'Cause she went away and didn't say,
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:22.460]   "Well, I don't want to be on the tour.
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:23.500]   "I don't want to do this anymore."
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:25.900]   She went away and prayed, let's say.
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:28.740]   How can I continue to do this?
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.420]   And that was the answer.
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:32.740]   And so she has her own hotel room.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:36.100]   And that was a really good decision on her part.
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:39.660]   And she's very good and getting better all the time
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:43.780]   at figuring out what has to happen for her
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:45.140]   to make this sustainable.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.340]   And all that's been is a plus.
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:50.980]   'Cause I don't want to travel without her,
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:53.580]   and I don't want her life to be miserable.
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.540]   And I want her to be fully on board.
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:58.300]   And so she has to be properly selfish,
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.740]   like everyone does in a relationship.
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.940]   - Yeah, and you have to, not just that,
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:05.260]   this is a weird thing that you're doing,
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:08.220]   and you have to, both you and her have to figure out
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:13.060]   how to manage this very intense intellectual,
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:14.820]   social journey. - Well, there's another element
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:16.380]   to it too that I didn't tell you about.
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:19.500]   So that was a typical day, but it's missing a big component
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.140]   because usually we also have a dinner
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:26.820]   with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose,
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.700]   10 to 30 from each country.
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:32.100]   'Cause I have a network of people who have networks
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:35.780]   who are setting me up with key decision makers
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:37.140]   in each country.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:39.540]   And so then we have like an hour and a half of that.
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:42.420]   Now, sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk,
[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:44.860]   but sometimes the talks are back to back.
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:49.700]   And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious.
[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:51.700]   And then people are showing us exciting things
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:53.940]   and tours in the cities, which is all,
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:56.380]   like it's a surf fight of wonderful.
[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:57.340]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:02:57.340 --> 02:03:00.220]   But it's still, yeah, you have to be there for it.
[02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:02.660]   You have to be present for it mentally
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:04.980]   as a curious mind, as an intellectual mind.
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:07.820]   How do you get to sleep?
[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:11.820]   - Fortunately, that is almost never a problem.
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:16.820]   Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years,
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:19.220]   I thought about that a lot too.
[02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:21.380]   I didn't do a really good job of explaining that
[02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:24.740]   while I was ill because it appeared in some sense
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:25.900]   that the reason I was ill
[02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:28.260]   was because I was taking benzodiazepines.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:29.820]   But that isn't why.
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:33.580]   I was ill and then I took them and very low dose.
[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:35.060]   And I took that for a long time
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:37.300]   and it helped whatever was wrong with me.
[02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:39.380]   And it looks like it was an allergy
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:41.020]   or maybe multiple allergies.
[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:44.980]   And then that stopped working.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:47.820]   And so I took a little bit more for about a month
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:48.940]   and that made it way worse.
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:50.860]   And so then I cut back a lot
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:54.740]   and then things really got out of hand.
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.740]   - So there was a deeper thing in the benzo.
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:58.580]   - Oh yeah, definitely.
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:00.180]   - Can you put words to-
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.540]   - Well, I had a lot of immune,
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:03.500]   well, my daughter, as everyone knows,
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:06.060]   has a very reactive immune system
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:09.820]   and Tammy has three immunological conditions.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:11.460]   Each of them quite serious.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.380]   And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis,
[02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:15.820]   which is an autoimmune condition,
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:20.420]   and alopecia areata and chronic gum disease,
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:23.020]   all of which appeared to be allergy related.
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:25.700]   And so Michaela seems to have got all of that.
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:28.460]   And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of,
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:30.580]   'cause I also had this proclivity to depression
[02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:32.860]   that was part of my family history.
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:34.740]   But I think that was all immunological
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:35.580]   as far as I can tell.
[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:37.820]   So one of the things that's happened to me,
[02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:40.500]   I always noticed I really couldn't breathe.
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.260]   Like I could breathe about one fifth
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:45.160]   as much as I sometimes could.
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:48.460]   And so I was always short of breath
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:53.100]   and it looks like what that was perhaps was
[02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:56.420]   I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction,
[02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:57.660]   which is not pleasant.
[02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:01.180]   And that's hyper sympathetic activation,
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:03.180]   no parasympathetic activation.
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:05.420]   I couldn't relax at all.
[02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:07.420]   - That's an immunological response.
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:08.900]   - Allergic response, yeah.
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:11.660]   So anyways, that was what seemed,
[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:14.500]   now I don't like to talk about this much
[02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:15.780]   'cause it's so bloody radical
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:17.300]   and I don't like to propagate it,
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:19.660]   but this diet seems to have stopped all of that.
[02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:22.660]   I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone.
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:25.500]   My gum disease, which is incurable,
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:27.260]   I had multiple surgeries to deal with it,
[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:30.380]   is completely gone, took three years.
[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:32.260]   My right eye, which was quite cloudy,
[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:33.620]   it's cleared up completely.
[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:36.940]   What else has changed?
[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:40.220]   Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly,
[02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:41.260]   and kept it off.
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:45.940]   - I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:47.740]   of nutritional science.
[02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:49.660]   I have my skepticism towards the degree
[02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:51.620]   to which it is currently a science
[02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:53.340]   'cause like a lot of complex systems,
[02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:57.980]   it's full of mystery and full of profiteers,
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:00.100]   the people that profit of different kinds of diets.
[02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:02.340]   But I should say for me personally,
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:05.140]   it does seem that I feel by far the best
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:06.380]   when I eat only meat.
[02:06:06.380 --> 02:06:07.260]   It's very interesting.
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:10.020]   And I discovered that a long time ago.
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:10.860]   First of all--
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:12.220]   - How do you discover it?
[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:15.540]   - So by, the discovery went like this.
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:17.940]   I started listening to ultra marathon runners
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:20.380]   about 15 years ago,
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:25.380]   and they started talking about fat adapted running.
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:31.100]   So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.420]   to enjoy running.
[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:35.420]   And in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace.
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:37.500]   So that was like step one.
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:39.620]   It's like, oh, okay, if I maintain,
[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:42.780]   this is something called the math rule,
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:45.020]   which is pretty low heart rate.
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:47.780]   If I maintain that, you can actually get pretty fast
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:50.700]   while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general.
[02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:55.700]   Anyway, they fuel themselves on low carb diets.
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:57.300]   So I got into that.
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:00.620]   On top of that, they also fast often.
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:04.740]   So I discovered how incredible my mind feels
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:05.860]   when fasted.
[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.180]   People call it intimated fasting, but--
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:10.380]   - Well, that's an optimization of death, eh?
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:15.300]   Because when you fast, your body logically,
[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:17.860]   and obviously, if you think about it biologically,
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:20.860]   is, well, what does your body scavenge first?
[02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:22.980]   Well, damaged tissue.
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:28.540]   So I know the literature on fasting to some degree,
[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:30.620]   and it's very compelling literature.
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:32.660]   If you starve dogs down,
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:35.020]   I think it's 20% below rats too,
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:38.100]   below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer.
[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:38.980]   - Yeah.
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:40.700]   - That's a lot, 30%.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:43.820]   It's like 30%, yeah, 30%.
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:46.340]   - Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things
[02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:48.700]   that make me nervous, 'cause I always feel like
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:51.500]   there's no free lunch that I'm gonna pay for it somehow.
[02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:55.940]   But there is a focus that I am able to attain when I fast,
[02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:57.860]   especially when I eat once a day.
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:01.340]   My mind is almost nervously focused.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:04.100]   It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one,
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:07.180]   or one that I can channel into just like an excitement.
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:10.460]   - You know, I wonder how much of that's associated with,
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:13.940]   well, imagine that that signifies lack of food,
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:15.940]   which is not that hard to imagine.
[02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:17.860]   Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:19.260]   in that situation, right?
[02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:22.740]   Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode,
[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:26.540]   let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:29.420]   And God only knows, maybe human beings
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:31.140]   should be in hunting mode all the time.
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.820]   - Often, but we don't know that.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:37.500]   So I wonder if it has a stress on the system
[02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:39.940]   that long-term causes the system to get--
[02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:41.260]   - It doesn't look like it.
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:43.660]   - It seems, in case of fasting, not.
[02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:46.380]   And then on top of that, I discovered that
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:51.380]   the thing I enjoy, I just don't enjoy eating fat as much.
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:55.620]   So I love eating meat, when you talk about low-carb diet.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:57.980]   So I just discovered through that process,
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:00.860]   if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat,
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:03.900]   I just feel a lot of the things
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:05.500]   that make me feel weird about food,
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:10.500]   like a little groggy or like full or just whatever,
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:14.060]   the aspects of food that I don't enjoy,
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:15.740]   they're not there with meat.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:18.300]   And I'm still able to enjoy company.
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:22.300]   And when I eat once a day and eat meat,
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.420]   I say, at least in Texas,
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:27.180]   you could still have all the merriment of,
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:28.780]   you have dinner with friends.
[02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:33.460]   Now, I don't do the, you have a very serious thing
[02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:37.140]   that there's health benefits
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:39.420]   that you are very serious about.
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.500]   For me, I could still drink whiskey.
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:45.340]   I'll still do the things that add a little bit of--
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:46.180]   - Spice.
[02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:47.580]   - Spice into the thing.
[02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:49.660]   Now, when you completely remove the spice,
[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:52.260]   it does become more difficult.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:53.740]   - Yeah, it's more difficult socially.
[02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:56.500]   And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb,
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:58.860]   although she might be able to eat non-aged beef.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:02.220]   And that makes traveling complicated too, right?
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:04.620]   Because, well, for obvious reasons,
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:06.720]   it's like, really, that's all you can eat?
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:09.740]   Yeah, well, c'est la vie.
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:12.300]   And maybe that's a form of craziness, but--
[02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:13.940]   - If we could return to actually the thing
[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:15.540]   you were talking about,
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:17.940]   when you were thinking about a question before the lecture.
[02:10:17.940 --> 02:10:18.780]   - Yeah.
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:20.660]   - Let me ask you about thinking in general.
[02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:25.500]   This is something maybe that you and Jim Keller
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:27.800]   think a lot about, is thinking how to think.
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:32.940]   How do you think through an idea?
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:35.540]   - Well, first of all, I think, okay,
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:38.100]   that's a really good question.
[02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:40.140]   We tried to work that out with this essay app
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:41.500]   that my son and I have developed,
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.740]   because if you're gonna write,
[02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:45.100]   the first question is, well, what should I write about?
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:46.100]   - What's the name of the app?
[02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:47.380]   - Essay.app.
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:51.300]   And, well, the first question is,
[02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:53.580]   well, what bugs you?
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:54.860]   What's bugging you?
[02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:56.040]   This is such a cool thing.
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:57.820]   It's like, where's my destiny?
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:00.820]   Well, what bothers you?
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:02.220]   Well, that's where your destiny is.
[02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:04.900]   Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:07.380]   Why did those things bother you?
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:09.700]   There's a lot of things you could be bothered by,
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.480]   like a million things, man.
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:13.580]   But some things grip you.
[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:16.740]   They bug you, and they might make you resentful and bitter,
[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:17.940]   'cause they bug you so much.
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:20.060]   Like, they're your things, man.
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.540]   They've got you.
[02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.740]   So then I look for a question
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:25.980]   that I would like the answer to,
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:29.740]   that I don't, and I would really like the answer to it,
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:32.380]   so I don't assume I already have the answer,
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:35.340]   'cause I would actually really like to have the answer.
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:39.220]   So if I could get a better answer, great.
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:40.220]   And so that's the first thing.
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:41.660]   And that's like a prayer.
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:45.300]   It's like, okay, here's a mystery.
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:49.740]   I would like to delve into it further.
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.060]   Well, so that's humility.
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:52.620]   It's like, here's a mystery,
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:54.140]   which means I don't know.
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:55.940]   I would like to delve into it further,
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:58.140]   which means I don't know enough already.
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:01.900]   And then comes the revelation.
[02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:04.380]   It's like, well, what's a revelation?
[02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:07.140]   Well, if you ask yourself a question,
[02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:10.420]   it's a real question, do you get an answer or not?
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:11.700]   And the answer is, well, yeah,
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:14.060]   thoughts start to appear in your head.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:15.260]   So-- - From somewhere.
[02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:16.580]   - That's right, from somewhere.
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:17.820]   - Where do they come from?
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:19.340]   Do you have a sense?
[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:21.660]   - Depends on what you're aiming at.
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:23.260]   - Depends on the question.
[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:26.300]   - No, it does to some degree.
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:29.060]   It depends on your intent.
[02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:32.540]   So imagine that your intent is to make things better.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:35.380]   Then maybe they come from the place
[02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:37.340]   that's designed to make things better.
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:39.860]   Maybe your intent is to make things worse.
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:41.380]   Then they come from hell.
[02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:43.460]   And you think, not really.
[02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:45.940]   It's like, you're so sure about that, are you?
[02:12:45.940 --> 02:12:47.420]   - Is your intent conscious?
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:49.500]   Like, are you able to introspect with intent?
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:51.740]   - It's conscious and habitual, right?
[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.060]   'Cause as you practice something consciously,
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:56.180]   it becomes habitual, but it's conscious.
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:59.580]   It's like, when I sit down before I do a lecture,
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:01.660]   I think, okay, what's the goal here?
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:04.140]   To do the best job I can.
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:05.060]   To what end?
[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:08.540]   Well, people are coming here not for political issues.
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.740]   They're coming here because they're trying
[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:11.780]   to make their lives better.
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.020]   Okay, so what are we doing?
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:14.940]   We're conducting a joint investigation
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:17.500]   into the nature of that which makes life better.
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.740]   Okay, what's my role?
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:21.780]   To do as good a job about that as possible.
[02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:23.620]   What state of mind do I have to be in?
[02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:25.980]   Am I annoyed about the theater?
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:30.260]   Or am I clued in and thrilled that 4,000 people
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.620]   have showed up at substantial expense and trouble
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:35.420]   to come and listen to me talk?
[02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:37.260]   And if I'm not in that state of mind, I think,
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:38.380]   well, maybe I need something to eat,
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:39.900]   or maybe I need to talk to someone.
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:44.460]   Because ingratitude is no place to start.
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:48.180]   It's like, I should be thrilled to be there, obviously.
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:50.300]   And so that orientation has to be there.
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:51.500]   And then I, is it conscious?
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:52.740]   All this is conscious.
[02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:53.860]   What am I serving?
[02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:55.820]   The highest good I can conceptualize.
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:56.920]   What is that?
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:58.740]   I have some sense, but I don't know it
[02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:01.580]   in the final analysis, which is why the investigation
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:02.620]   is being conducted.
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:03.700]   Who's doing it?
[02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:07.860]   Me, whoever I'm communing with, and the audience.
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:10.060]   And so I try to get myself,
[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:11.540]   and I chase everybody away for that.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:13.540]   It's like, I have to do that by myself.
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:15.820]   - Are you writing stuff down?
[02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:17.100]   - Yes, at that point.
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:19.300]   I just make point notes.
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:21.980]   And it's usually about maybe 30 notes.
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:24.200]   But then on stage, I never refer to them.
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:27.740]   And I often don't even use the structure that I laid out.
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.300]   - Kind of an interesting thing.
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:31.580]   From where do powerful phrases come from?
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:38.420]   Do you try to encapsulate an idea into a sentence or two?
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:42.060]   - Well, when I talk, and I've practiced this
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:45.740]   since, consciously, since 1985,
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:51.600]   I try to feel and see if the words are stepping stones
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:53.860]   or foundation stones, right?
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:55.220]   It's like, is this solid?
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:56.480]   Is this word solid?
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:57.840]   Is this phrase solid?
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:14:59.620]   Is this sentence solid?
[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:04.160]   It's a real sense of fundamental foundation
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:05.080]   under each word.
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.220]   And I suppose people ask me if I pray,
[02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:11.100]   and I would say, I pray before every word.
[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:16.280]   Well, when you're asking questions,
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:21.220]   like you're very clear-headed and present
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:25.520]   in your ability to ask questions and inquire.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:27.320]   So how do you do that?
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:29.180]   - So first of all,
[02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:36.780]   I'm worried that my mind easily gets trapped
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:41.840]   when I step on a word and I know it's unstable.
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:45.340]   You kind of realize that you don't really know
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:47.860]   the definitions of any words you use,
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:51.460]   and that can be debilitating.
[02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:56.580]   So I kind of try to be more carefree about the words I use.
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:59.140]   Because otherwise you get trapped.
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:00.880]   - You don't want to be obsessional.
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:04.860]   - Like literally, my mind halfway through the sentence
[02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:08.620]   will think, well, what does the word sentence mean?
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:09.620]   - Right, right, right.
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:10.460]   Well, you know, neurologically--
[02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:12.580]   - And then everything else just explodes.
[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:14.660]   Your big picture idea explodes
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:17.380]   and you lost yourself in the minutia.
[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:21.860]   - Well, neurologically, there's a production center
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:23.820]   and an editing center,
[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:27.180]   and those can be separately affected by strokes.
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:30.380]   And so often when people are writing or talking,
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:33.100]   they try to activate both at the same time.
[02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:35.700]   And that's so people will try to write an essay
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.500]   and get every sentence right in the first draft.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:38.940]   That's a big mistake.
[02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:39.860]   And so then you might say,
[02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:42.780]   well, how can you be careful with your words, but carefree?
[02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:46.180]   And the answer is orient yourself properly, right?
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.240]   While in the conversation we're having,
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:50.020]   you have an orientation structure.
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:53.860]   You want to be prepared, you want to be attentive.
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:56.300]   Then you want to have an interesting conversation,
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:58.380]   and you want to have the kind of interesting conversation
[02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:01.520]   that other people want to listen to
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:04.460]   that will be good for them in some manner.
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:06.300]   Okay, so that's pretty good frame.
[02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:09.660]   And then you kind of scour your heart and you think,
[02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:10.820]   is that really what you want?
[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.860]   Are you after fame or after notoriety?
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:14.220]   Are you after money?
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:17.780]   I'm not saying any of those things are necessarily bad,
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:20.060]   but they're not optimal,
[02:17:20.060 --> 02:17:22.820]   especially if you're not willing to admit them, right?
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:24.660]   And so they can contaminate you.
[02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:26.800]   So you want to be decontaminated.
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:29.500]   So you have the right trip, let's say.
[02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:31.920]   And so you have to put yourself,
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:33.100]   that's a meditative practice.
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:36.620]   You have to put yourself in the right receptive position
[02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:38.140]   with the right goal in mind.
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:43.060]   Then you can, and I think you can get better and better
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:47.340]   at this, then you can trust what's going to happen.
[02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:49.660]   You know, so for example, before I came here,
[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:52.800]   I mean, I presume you have a reason
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:55.820]   for doing the podcast with me.
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:56.860]   What's the reason?
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:18:03.060]   - I mean, we wanted to talk for a long time.
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:04.580]   So the reason has evolved.
[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:10.900]   The, one of the reasons is I've listened to you
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.220]   for quite a long time.
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:15.540]   So you've become a one-way friend
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.660]   and I have many one-way friends.
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:20.220]   Some of my best friends don't even know I exist.
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:24.020]   So I'm a big fan of podcasts and audio books.
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:26.080]   Actually, most of my friends are dead.
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:26.920]   - Yeah, right.
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:28.880]   - The writers--
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.180]   - The definition of a reader.
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:31.020]   - Yeah.
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:34.380]   - I've worked with a lot of dead, great dead friends.
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:37.460]   So I wanted to meet this one-way friend, I suppose,
[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:39.660]   and have a conversation.
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:42.420]   And then there's this kind of puzzle
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:44.020]   that I've been longing to solve,
[02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:46.460]   the same reason I went to Ukraine,
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:50.500]   of asking this question of myself, who am I?
[02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:52.980]   And what was this part of the world?
[02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:56.280]   What is this thing that happened in the 20th century?
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:59.420]   That I lost so much of my family there
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:03.540]   and I feel so much of my family's defined by that place.
[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:06.860]   Now that place includes the Soviet Union,
[02:19:06.860 --> 02:19:09.620]   it includes Russia and Ukraine,
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:11.100]   it includes Nazi Germany,
[02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:14.580]   includes these big, powerful leaders
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:19.580]   and huge millions of people that were lost in the beauty,
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:22.060]   the power of the dream,
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:27.060]   but were also the torture that was forced onto them
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:33.500]   through different governmental institutions.
[02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:37.300]   And you are somebody that seemed from some angle
[02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:41.980]   to also be drawn to try to understand what was that.
[02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:44.660]   And not in some sort of historical sense,
[02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:47.320]   but in a deeply psychological human sense.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:48.160]   What is that?
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:49.700]   Will it repeat again?
[02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:51.700]   In what way is it repeating again?
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:53.100]   - And how can we stop it?
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:54.100]   - And how can we stop it?
[02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:54.920]   And so--
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:55.760]   - That's the crucial issue.
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:00.080]   - I felt I wanted to, from a very different backgrounds,
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:04.180]   pull at the thread of that curiosity.
[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:08.560]   You know, I'm an engineer, you're a psychologist,
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:12.720]   both lost in that curiosity and both wear suits.
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:14.000]   (laughs)
[02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000]   And talk with various levels of eloquence
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:23.680]   about sort of the shadows that that history casts on us.
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:30.340]   And so that was one.
[02:20:30.340 --> 02:20:31.580]   And also the psychology.
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:33.820]   I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time.
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:37.700]   I was fascinated by the human mind.
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:41.060]   Until I discovered artificial intelligence,
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:44.180]   the fact that I could program and make a robot move,
[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:47.660]   and until I discovered that magic,
[02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:50.020]   I thought I wanted to understand the human mind
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:52.180]   by being a psychiatrist, by talking to people,
[02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:55.020]   through talk therapy, psychotherapy.
[02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:56.700]   - So now you've got the best of both worlds
[02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:58.080]   because you get to talk to people
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.740]   and you get to build robots.
[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:03.540]   - Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot.
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:05.820]   That I felt like by building the thing,
[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:08.340]   can you start to try to understand it.
[02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:09.420]   That's one way.
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:12.540]   I mean, we all have different skills and proclivities.
[02:21:12.540 --> 02:21:17.540]   So like my particular one has to do with,
[02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:21.820]   I learn by building.
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:25.540]   I think through a thing by building it.
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:27.620]   And programming is a wonderful thing
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:30.660]   because it allows you to build a little toy example.
[02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:33.820]   So in the same way you can do a little thought experiment,
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:35.780]   programming allows you to create a thought experiment
[02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:37.660]   in action, it can move, it can live,
[02:21:37.660 --> 02:21:40.260]   and then you can ask questions of it.
[02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:45.020]   So all of those, because of my interest in Freud and Jung,
[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:51.860]   you're also in different ways have delved deeply
[02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:56.700]   into humanity, the human psyche,
[02:21:56.700 --> 02:22:00.300]   through the perspective of those psychologists.
[02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:04.380]   So for all those reasons, I thought our paths would cross.
[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:07.500]   - Yeah, so that's quite a frame for a discussion, right?
[02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:09.860]   You had all sorts of reasons and then you think,
[02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:13.180]   well, are you just letting the conversation go where it will?
[02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:15.460]   It's like, well, not exactly.
[02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:17.820]   You spent all this time.
[02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:19.820]   It's not like this came about by accident,
[02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:23.020]   this conversation, you spent all this time framing it.
[02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:26.780]   And so all of that provides the implicit substructure
[02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:28.580]   for the play in the conversation.
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:31.460]   And if you have that implicit, here's another way,
[02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:34.260]   this is very much worth knowing is,
[02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:36.900]   if you get the implicit structure of perception right,
[02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:39.100]   everything becomes a game.
[02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:42.260]   And not only that, a game you wanna play.
[02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:44.060]   And maybe in the final analysis,
[02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:45.820]   a game you'd wanna play forever.
[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:52.020]   So, you know, that's obviously a distant beckoning ideal,
[02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:57.180]   but we know games need rules or there's no play.
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:23:03.140]   - Is there advice you can give now that we know the frame
[02:23:03.140 --> 02:23:08.140]   to give to me, Lex, about how to do this podcast better,
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:14.540]   how to think about this world, how to be a good engineer,
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:25.520]   how to be a good human being from what you know about me?
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:28.200]   - Take your preoccupation with suffering seriously.
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:33.760]   It's a serious business, right?
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:36.600]   And that's part of that, to circle back to the beginning,
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:40.080]   let's say, that's that willingness to gaze into the abyss,
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:41.540]   which is obviously what you were doing
[02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:43.440]   when you went to Ukraine.
[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:48.440]   It's like, it's gazing into the abyss that makes you better.
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:51.720]   The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche's idea
[02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:55.100]   is not as differentiated as it became.
[02:23:55.100 --> 02:24:00.840]   Sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:04.920]   towards the abyss, and then you're traumatized.
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:08.140]   If it's involuntary and accidental, it can kill you.
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:14.100]   The more it's voluntary, the more transformative it is.
[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:18.200]   And that's part of that idea about facing death and hell.
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:21.280]   It's like, can you tolerate death and hell?
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:26.280]   And the answer is, this terrible answer is yes,
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.580]   to the degree that you're willing to do it voluntarily.
[02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:34.200]   And then you might ask, well, why should I have
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:37.360]   to subject myself to death and hell?
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:38.960]   I'm innocent.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:40.800]   And then the answer to that is,
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:47.920]   even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed
[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:48.920]   to the highest good.
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:56.400]   - That's such an interesting distinction.
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:59.800]   Voluntary suffering.
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:00.960]   - Voluntary, yeah.
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:04.880]   Well, that's why the central Christian doctrine is,
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:06.960]   pick up your cross and follow me.
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.740]   And I'm speaking, not in religious terms, saying that.
[02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:13.560]   I'm just speaking as a psychologist.
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:15.360]   It's like, one of the things we've learned
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.800]   in the last hundred years is, voluntary exposure
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:22.120]   to that which freezes and terrifies you
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:25.260]   in measured proportions is curative.
[02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:30.240]   - So a form of, at least in part,
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:32.460]   involuntary suffering is depression.
[02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:38.900]   Do you have advice for people on how to find a way out?
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:43.480]   You're a man who has suffered in this way,
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:46.160]   perhaps continue to suffer in this way.
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:47.680]   How do you find a way out?
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:53.640]   - The first thing I do as a clinician,
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:55.720]   if someone comes to me and says they're depressed,
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:57.360]   is ask myself a question.
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.480]   Well, what does this person mean by that?
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:02.360]   So I have to find out, like,
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:03.640]   because maybe they're not depressed,
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:06.840]   maybe they're hyper-anxious, or maybe they're obsessional.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:10.400]   Like, there's various forms of powerful negative emotion.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.360]   So they need to be differentiated.
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:14.120]   But then the next question you have to ask is,
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:19.120]   well, are you depressed, or do you have a terrible life,
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:21.820]   or is it some combination of the two?
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:26.160]   So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell,
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:27.720]   you don't have a terrible life.
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:30.840]   You have friends, you have family,
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:32.160]   you have an intimate relationship,
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:33.640]   you have a job or a career,
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:35.380]   you're about as educated as you should be,
[02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:36.820]   given your intelligence,
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:39.220]   you use your time outside of work wisely,
[02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:42.620]   you're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations,
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:47.600]   you're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense,
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.440]   and all that's working.
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:52.560]   Now, if you have all that, and you're feeling really awful,
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:54.920]   you're either ill or you're depressed.
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:58.320]   And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route to that,
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:26:59.240]   treatment of that.
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:01.120]   My experience has been as a clinician,
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:03.760]   is if you're depressed, but you have a life,
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:05.640]   and you take an antidepressant,
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:07.240]   it will probably help you a lot.
[02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:11.560]   Now, maybe you're not depressed, exactly.
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:13.560]   You just have a terrible life.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:14.840]   What does that look like?
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:20.080]   You have no relationship, your family's a mess,
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:24.440]   you've got no friends, you've got no plan, you've got no job,
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:26.100]   you use your time outside of work,
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:28.240]   not only badly, but destructively,
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:30.520]   you have a drug or alcohol habit,
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:33.520]   or some other vice, pornography addiction,
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.320]   you are completely unengaged in the surrounding community,
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:41.300]   you have no scaffolding whatsoever to support you
[02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:44.460]   in your current mode of being, or your move forward.
[02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:48.700]   And then, as a therapist, well, you do two things.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:51.820]   Well, if it's depression, per se, well, like I said,
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:55.180]   there's sometimes a biochemical route, a nutritional route,
[02:27:55.180 --> 02:27:56.760]   there's ways that can be addressed,
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:59.660]   it's probably physiological, if you're, at least in part,
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:01.900]   if you're depressed, but you have an okay life,
[02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:03.900]   sometimes it's conceptual.
[02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:06.580]   You can turn to dreams, sometimes to help people,
[02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:09.780]   'cause dreams contain the seeds of the potential future,
[02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:12.140]   and if your person is a real good dreamer,
[02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:14.540]   and you can analyze dreams, that can be really helpful,
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:17.460]   but that seems to be only true for more creative people.
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:19.460]   And for the people who just have a terrible life,
[02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:22.780]   it's like, okay, you have a terrible life,
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:26.820]   well, let's pick a front.
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:31.820]   How about you need a friend, like one sort of friend?
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:36.340]   Do you know how to shake hands and introduce yourself?
[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:40.420]   I'll have the person show me, so let's do it for a sec.
[02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:45.060]   So, it's like this, hi, I'm Jordan, right?
[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:46.800]   And people don't know how to do that,
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:49.100]   and then they can't even get the ball rolling.
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.340]   - For the listener, Jordan just gave me a firm handshake.
[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:54.380]   - Yeah, as opposed to a dead fish, you know?
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:56.940]   And there's these elementary social skills
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:28:59.780]   that hypothetically, if you were well cared for,
[02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:02.060]   you learned when you were like three,
[02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:04.980]   and sometimes people have, I had lots of clients,
[02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:09.900]   to whom no one ever paid any attention.
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:12.700]   And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention.
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:13.980]   And some of that was just listening,
[02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:17.580]   'cause they had 10,000 hours of conversations
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:19.220]   they never had with anyone,
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:21.620]   and they were all tangled up in their head.
[02:29:21.620 --> 02:29:24.900]   And they had to just, one client in particular,
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:28.500]   I worked with this person for 15 years,
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:33.500]   and what she wanted from me was for me
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:36.420]   just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes,
[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:38.020]   which was very hard for me,
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:42.020]   and to just tell me what had happened to her.
[02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:44.980]   And then what happened at the end of the conversation,
[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:48.100]   then I could discuss a bit with her.
[02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:50.300]   And then as we progressed through the years,
[02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:52.580]   the amount of time that we spent in discussion
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:55.220]   increased in proportion in the sessions,
[02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:58.780]   until by the time we stopped seeing each other,
[02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:00.820]   when my clinical practice collapsed,
[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:06.380]   we were talking about 80% of the time.
[02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:07.500]   But she literally,
[02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:09.980]   she'd never been attended to properly, ever.
[02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:13.620]   And so she was an uncarved block in the Taoist sense, right?
[02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:16.380]   She hadn't been subjected to those flaming swords
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:19.420]   that separated the wheat from the chaff.
[02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:22.740]   And so you can do that in therapy.
[02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:25.460]   If you're listening and you're depressed,
[02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:28.380]   I would say, if you can't find a therapist,
[02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:29.860]   and that's getting harder and harder,
[02:30:29.860 --> 02:30:32.260]   'cause it's actually become illegal to be a therapist now,
[02:30:32.260 --> 02:30:34.540]   'cause you have to agree with your clients,
[02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:37.420]   which is a terrible thing to do with them.
[02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:40.700]   Just like it's terrible just to arbitrarily oppose them.
[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:44.060]   You could do the self-authoring program online,
[02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:46.580]   'cause it helps you write an autobiography.
[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:49.460]   And so if you have memories that are more than 18 months old
[02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:51.580]   that bother you when you think them up,
[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:54.340]   part of you is locked inside that.
[02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:59.340]   An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that.
[02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:01.620]   That's a metaphorical way of thinking about it.
[02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:04.140]   And that's why it still has emotional significance.
[02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:06.780]   So you can write about your past experiences,
[02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:08.780]   but I would say wait for at least 18 months
[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:10.460]   if something bad has happened to you,
[02:31:10.460 --> 02:31:12.100]   'cause otherwise you just hurt yourself again
[02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:13.180]   by encountering it.
[02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:16.740]   You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography.
[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:18.940]   There's an analysis of faults and virtues,
[02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:20.060]   that's the present authoring.
[02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:23.700]   And then there's a guided writing exercise
[02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:25.980]   that helps you make a future plan.
[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:30.460]   That's, young men who do that could go to college.
[02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:32.460]   Young men who do that, 90 minutes,
[02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:34.460]   just the future authoring, 90 minutes.
[02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:37.260]   They're 50% less likely to drop out.
[02:31:37.260 --> 02:31:38.900]   That's all it takes.
[02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:43.580]   - So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud
[02:31:43.580 --> 02:31:46.340]   that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it.
[02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:48.860]   Or you said isolate, make a friend.
[02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:49.700]   - Oh man, sometimes-
[02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:52.060]   - The first step is extremely difficult.
[02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:54.940]   - Oh my God, sometimes it's way worse than that.
[02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:57.100]   Like I had clients who were so depressed,
[02:31:57.100 --> 02:31:59.060]   they literally couldn't get out of bed.
[02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:01.180]   So what's their first step?
[02:32:01.180 --> 02:32:05.940]   It's like, can you sit up once today?
[02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:10.620]   No, can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?
[02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:13.260]   Like you just, you scale back the dragon
[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:16.980]   till you find one that's conquerable,
[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:18.140]   that moves you forward.
[02:32:18.140 --> 02:32:19.900]   There's a rubric for life.
[02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:23.180]   Scale back the dragons till you find one conquerable.
[02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:25.900]   And it'll give you a little bit of gold.
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:27.300]   Commensurate with the struggle.
[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:29.140]   But the plus side of that,
[02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:31.060]   'cause that's, you think that, God, that's depressing.
[02:32:31.060 --> 02:32:35.420]   You mean I have to start by sitting up?
[02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:37.740]   Well, you do if you can't sit up.
[02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:39.340]   But the plus side of that is,
[02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:40.980]   it's the Pareto distribution issue,
[02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:45.860]   is that aggregates exponentially increase.
[02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:47.980]   And failures do too, by the way.
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:50.140]   But aggregates exponentially increase.
[02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:51.580]   So once you start the ball rolling,
[02:32:51.580 --> 02:32:53.380]   it can get zipping along pretty good.
[02:32:53.380 --> 02:32:55.020]   This person that I talked about
[02:32:56.660 --> 02:33:00.460]   was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe
[02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.100]   when we first met, just talking,
[02:33:02.100 --> 02:33:04.180]   even though I was her therapist.
[02:33:04.180 --> 02:33:07.420]   But by the end, she was doing stand-up comedy.
[02:33:07.420 --> 02:33:10.900]   So, you know, it took years.
[02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:14.020]   But still, most people won't do stand-up comedy.
[02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:15.940]   That's quite the bloody achievement.
[02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:19.260]   She would read her poetry on stage too.
[02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:23.860]   So for someone who was petrified into paralysis
[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:28.860]   by social anxiety, and who had to start very small,
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:31.620]   it was a hell of an accomplishment.
[02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:33.940]   - Yeah, it all starts with one step.
[02:33:33.940 --> 02:33:38.220]   Do you have advice for young people in high school?
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:41.340]   You're given, a lot of people look up to you for advice,
[02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:46.340]   for strength, for strength to search for themselves,
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:47.980]   to find themselves.
[02:33:47.980 --> 02:33:49.660]   - Take on some responsibility.
[02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:53.260]   Do something for other people.
[02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:54.700]   You're doing something for yourself
[02:33:54.700 --> 02:33:57.260]   while you're doing that, even if you don't know it,
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:00.220]   for sure, 'cause you're a community across time.
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:02.580]   Find something to serve.
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:04.900]   - Somebody to help, a problem to solve.
[02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:08.940]   - A job, find a job, do your best with the customers.
[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:10.220]   Don't be above your job.
[02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:12.780]   You're gonna get an entry-level job when you're a kid.
[02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:14.700]   Well, what else would you want?
[02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:15.540]   You wanna be the boss?
[02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:16.380]   What do you know?
[02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:17.780]   You don't know anything.
[02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:20.260]   You could be the boss of your job.
[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:22.180]   You know, if you're working in a grocery store,
[02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:23.340]   you're working in a convenience store,
[02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:26.620]   assuming you're not working for terrified tyrants,
[02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:28.700]   you can be nice to the customers.
[02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:30.940]   You can develop your social skills.
[02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:34.140]   You can learn how to handle boss-employee relationship.
[02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:37.780]   You can be there 15 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late.
[02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:40.380]   Like you can learn in an entry-level job, man.
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:42.900]   And I'll tell you, if you take an entry-level job
[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:45.860]   and you learn, and it's a reasonably decent place,
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:48.460]   you will not be in an entry-level job for long.
[02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:50.100]   Because everyone who's competent
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:52.140]   is desperate for competent people.
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.140]   And if you go and show yourself as competent,
[02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:55.140]   there'll be a trial period.
[02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:57.140]   But if you go show yourself as competent,
[02:34:57.140 --> 02:34:59.260]   all sorts of doors you didn't even know were there
[02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:01.060]   will start opening like mad.
[02:35:01.060 --> 02:35:04.420]   - So you strive for competence, for craftsmanship.
[02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:05.900]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:08.940]   For discipline, you know, I mean,
[02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:11.420]   I said in one of the chapters of my books
[02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:14.140]   is focused on putting your house in order.
[02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:15.740]   It's like, well, how do you start?
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:16.660]   Make your bed.
[02:35:16.660 --> 02:35:21.500]   You know, it actually took me quite a long time in my life
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.540]   before I made my bed regularly in the morning.
[02:35:23.540 --> 02:35:25.340]   Most of my life was in pretty good order,
[02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:27.660]   but that was one thing I didn't have in order.
[02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:31.020]   My clothes in my closet as well, all that's in order.
[02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:31.860]   Not all of it.
[02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:33.260]   I'm cleaning out some drawers right now,
[02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:37.940]   but look around and see what bugs you in your room.
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:39.180]   Just look.
[02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:40.900]   It's like, okay, I'm in my room.
[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:41.860]   Do I like this room?
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:43.060]   No, it bugs me.
[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:44.780]   Okay, why?
[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:47.340]   Well, the paint's peeling there and it's dusty there
[02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:50.860]   and the carpet's dirty and that corner's kind of ugly
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:52.340]   and the light there isn't very good
[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:54.380]   and my clothes closet's a mess,
[02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:56.500]   so I don't even like to open it.
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:59.140]   Okay, that's a lot of problems.
[02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:00.340]   That sucks.
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:02.340]   That's a lot of opportunity.
[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:04.300]   Pick something and fix it.
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:05.980]   - Something that bugs you.
[02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:07.460]   - Yeah, but not too much.
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:11.980]   So the rule is pick something you know would make,
[02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:14.900]   pick a problem, pick a solution to it
[02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:18.980]   that you know would help, that you could do,
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:20.740]   that you would do.
[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:22.180]   So you have to negotiate with yourself.
[02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:23.860]   It's like, well, I won't clean up this room.
[02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:24.700]   How do you know?
[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:27.060]   I've been in here for 10 years and I've never cleaned it up.
[02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:29.700]   It's like, well, obviously that's too big a dragon for you.
[02:36:29.700 --> 02:36:32.340]   Would you clean one drawer?
[02:36:32.340 --> 02:36:33.180]   Find out.
[02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:35.740]   And so imagine now you want to be happy
[02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:37.140]   when you open that drawer and you think,
[02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:37.980]   well, that's stupid.
[02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:38.820]   It's like, is it?
[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:41.580]   Maybe it's your sock drawer,
[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:44.380]   which I cleaned up in my room the other day, by the way.
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:46.260]   You're gonna open that every morning.
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:50.820]   That's like 30 seconds of your life every day.
[02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:54.940]   Okay, so that's three minutes a week.
[02:36:54.940 --> 02:36:57.340]   That's 12 minutes a month.
[02:36:57.340 --> 02:36:59.580]   That's two hours a year.
[02:36:59.580 --> 02:37:01.100]   So maybe your life is made out of,
[02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:02.740]   you've got 16 hours a day.
[02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:03.660]   Let's figure this out.
[02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:06.900]   Five, 12 in an hour, 12 in an hour,
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:09.180]   144 in 12 hours.
[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:10.620]   Yeah, let's say 200.
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:12.060]   200 five-minute chunks.
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:12.900]   That's your life.
[02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:15.300]   - Ladies and gentlemen, Jordan Peterson did just some math
[02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:17.460]   how many five-minute chunks there are in a day.
[02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:19.300]   And I'm pretty sure that's pretty accurate.
[02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:20.620]   - It's approximately right.
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:24.580]   So you got 200 five-minute chunks and they repeat.
[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:26.380]   A lot of them repeat.
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:28.260]   So if you get every one of those right,
[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:29.100]   they're trivial, right?
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:30.740]   Who cares what my sock drawer looks like?
[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:33.100]   It's fair enough, man, but that's your life.
[02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:36.820]   The things you repeat every day, the mundane things.
[02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:39.340]   Think I could get all those mundane things right.
[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:40.620]   That's the game rules.
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:43.380]   It's like now all the mundane is in place.
[02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:45.900]   Now you can play 'cause all the mundane's in place.
[02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:47.020]   And this is actually true.
[02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:51.060]   So with children, imagine you want your children to play.
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:53.700]   Well, play is very fragile neurologically.
[02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:57.380]   Any competing motivation or emotion will suppress play.
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:37:59.340]   So everything has to be in order.
[02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:02.100]   Everything has to be a walled garden
[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:04.140]   before the children will play.
[02:38:04.140 --> 02:38:05.980]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:07.500]   So you put everything in order and you think,
[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:09.580]   oh my God, now I'm tyrannized by this order.
[02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:12.580]   It's like, no, you aren't, not if it's voluntary.
[02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:15.740]   And then the order is the precondition for the freedom.
[02:38:15.740 --> 02:38:17.540]   And so then all of a sudden you get all these things
[02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:19.380]   in order, it's like, oh, look at this.
[02:38:19.380 --> 02:38:21.660]   I've got some room to play here.
[02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:24.860]   And then maybe you're not depressed.
[02:38:24.860 --> 02:38:26.940]   Now it's often not that simple.
[02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:28.660]   It's not that simple.
[02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:31.100]   Try putting your room in order, perfect order.
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:31.940]   That's hard, man.
[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:33.340]   - I mean, it's a really powerful way to think
[02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:34.500]   about those five minute chunks.
[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:36.820]   Just get one of them right in a day.
[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:39.420]   - Yeah, well, if you do that for 200 days,
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:40.740]   your life is in order.
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:44.020]   You know, I thought I did that with my clients a lot.
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.540]   So a lot of them would come home from work.
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:47.980]   The guys, hey, and their wives would meet them at the door
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:49.980]   and it'd be a fight right away.
[02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:51.180]   You know, and it's a clash there
[02:38:51.180 --> 02:38:53.340]   'cause he comes home and he's tired and hungry.
[02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:55.740]   He's worked all day and he's hoping that, you know,
[02:38:55.740 --> 02:38:58.040]   he gets welcomed when he comes back to the home,
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:38:59.900]   but then the wife is at home
[02:38:59.900 --> 02:39:01.100]   and she's been with the kids all day
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:02.100]   and she's tired and hungry.
[02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:03.460]   And she's hoping that when he comes home,
[02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:05.860]   he'll show her some appreciation for what's happened today.
[02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:08.260]   And then they clash and then they both have problems
[02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:10.540]   to discuss 'cause they've had their troubles during the day.
[02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:13.220]   And so then every time they get together,
[02:39:13.220 --> 02:39:16.340]   they're not like it's a bit of a fight for 20 minutes
[02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:18.940]   and then the whole evening is screwed.
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:21.860]   And so then you think, okay, here's the deal.
[02:39:21.860 --> 02:39:24.980]   It's knock and the door will open.
[02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:28.920]   Okay, you get to pick what happens when you come home,
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:30.220]   but you have to figure out what it is.
[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:31.980]   So now this is the deal.
[02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:33.900]   You treat yourself properly.
[02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:37.020]   You imagine coming home and it goes the way you want
[02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:38.620]   and need it to go.
[02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:41.400]   Okay, what does that look like?
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:42.240]   You get to have it,
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:44.140]   but you have to know what it is.
[02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:46.020]   What does it look like?
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.060]   And you think, okay, I wanna come home.
[02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:50.020]   I wanna be happy about coming home.
[02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:53.580]   I come home, I open the door.
[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:56.060]   I say, hello, honey, I'm home.
[02:39:56.060 --> 02:39:58.760]   My wife says, hi, it's so nice to hear your voice.
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:02.420]   She comes up, she says, hi, dear.
[02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:05.100]   She gives you a hug and she says, how was your day?
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:07.420]   And you say, well, we'll sit and talk about that.
[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:08.700]   How was your day?
[02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:10.540]   Well, we'll sit and talk about that.
[02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:12.760]   Do you need something to eat?
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:14.320]   Probably.
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:16.240]   Let's go sit and talk about our day.
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:18.160]   It's like, that sounds pretty good.
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:20.040]   Okay, that sounds pretty good.
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:20.880]   Might not be perfect,
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:22.000]   but sounds a hell of a lot better
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.240]   than what we're doing now.
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:26.240]   So how about we go talk to,
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:29.300]   we'll go talk to your wife and say, okay,
[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:31.040]   this is what's happening when I come home.
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:32.740]   I would like it to be better.
[02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:34.360]   What would you like to have happen
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:37.240]   if you could have what you wanted?
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:39.260]   And so she sits down and she thinks,
[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:41.520]   okay, if he comes home, what do I want to have happen?
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:44.200]   And then now you got two visions and you say,
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:45.200]   well, what would you like?
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:48.920]   And you listen and she says, what would you like?
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:50.560]   And you tell her, and then you think,
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:53.320]   okay, now how can we bring these visions together?
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:55.600]   So not only do we both get what we want,
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:57.040]   but because we've brought them together,
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:40:58.620]   we even get more than we want.
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:40:59.960]   Well, who wouldn't agree to that
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:01.920]   unless they were aiming down?
[02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:02.860]   And that's so exciting.
[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:04.320]   It's not a compromise.
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:08.320]   It's a union of ideals that's even makes a better ideal.
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:09.440]   And then you get to come home.
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.080]   And then there's another rule that goes along with that,
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:15.700]   which is, please, dear, have the grace
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:19.660]   to allow me to do this stupidly and badly.
[02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:22.320]   Well, I learned at least 20 times
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:25.960]   and I'll give you the same leeway.
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:28.920]   And then we'll practice stupidly for 20 times
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:30.480]   and we'll talk about it.
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:31.980]   And then maybe we'll get it right
[02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:34.520]   for the next 10,000 times.
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:35.480]   Right?
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:37.840]   And you can do that with your whole life
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:39.100]   and you can do that with your kids
[02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:40.840]   and you can do that with your family.
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:42.520]   Like, it's not easy, but you can do it.
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:44.560]   It's a lot easier than the alternative.
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:47.560]   - Let me ask for some dating advice from Jordan Peterson.
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:52.480]   How do you find on that topic, the love of your life?
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:54.520]   - That's a good question.
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:58.020]   I was asked that multiple times on my tour,
[02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.560]   three times in a row, in fact,
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:02.900]   'cause we ask people to use this Slido gadget.
[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:05.040]   - That's a popular question?
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:06.000]   - To vary.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.240]   It always came up to the top.
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:10.240]   And I got asked that three times in a row
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.680]   and I didn't have a good answer.
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:16.360]   And then I thought, why don't I have a good answer?
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:17.880]   I thought, oh, I know why.
[02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:19.680]   'Cause that's a stupid question.
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:24.080]   So why?
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:25.400]   Why?
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.880]   Because it's putting the cart before the horse.
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:29.220]   Here's the right question.
[02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:33.480]   How do I make myself into the perfect date?
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.200]   You answer that question
[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:37.800]   and you will not have any problem
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:39.080]   answering the previous question.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:42.000]   It's like, what do I want in a partner?
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:46.260]   If I offered everything I could to a partner,
[02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:47.920]   who would I be?
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.120]   You work on that.
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:49.960]   Ask that question.
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.560]   Just ask, just ask yourself, okay.
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:57.560]   I have to be the person that women would want.
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:00.560]   Okay, what do they want?
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:05.280]   Clean, that's not a bad start.
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:09.680]   Reasonably good physical shape.
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:16.280]   So healthy, productive, generous, honest,
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:21.600]   willing to delay gratification.
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:22.800]   So you dance with a woman.
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:23.720]   It's like, what's she doing?
[02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:24.720]   What are you two doing?
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:26.520]   Well, it's a patterned,
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:28.020]   there's patterns happening around you.
[02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:30.320]   That's the music, patterns, patterns of being.
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:31.720]   That's the music.
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:32.900]   Now, can you align yourself
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:35.120]   with the patterns of being gracefully?
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:37.320]   That's what she's checking out.
[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:40.360]   And then can you do that with her?
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:42.520]   And then can you do that
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:45.400]   in a playful and attentive manner
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:47.240]   and keep your bloody hands to yourself
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:48.560]   for at least a minute?
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.840]   And so can you dance in a playful manner?
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:55.240]   It's like, you can go through this in your imagination
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:58.000]   and you know, you'll know, you know.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.280]   And then you think, well, how far am I from those things?
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:01.740]   And the answer is usually, man,
[02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:06.600]   it's pretty horrible abyss separating you from that ideal.
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:11.600]   But the harder you work on offering other people
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:14.140]   what they need and want,
[02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:16.940]   the more people will line up to play with you.
[02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:18.360]   And so it's the wrong question.
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:21.380]   It's like, how can I be the best partner possible?
[02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:22.780]   And then you think, well, if I do that,
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:25.340]   people will just take advantage of me.
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:29.180]   And that's the non-naive objection, right?
[02:44:29.180 --> 02:44:30.340]   'Cause the naive person's saying,
[02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:31.940]   well, I'll be good and everyone will treat me right.
[02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:34.940]   It's like the cynic says, no, I'll be good.
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:37.740]   And someone will take me out.
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:40.980]   And then you think, well, what do you do
[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:42.060]   about that objection?
[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:45.740]   And the answer is, well, you factor that in.
[02:44:45.740 --> 02:44:48.820]   And that's why you're supposed to be, what is it?
[02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:51.340]   As soft as a dove and as wise as a serpent.
[02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:54.380]   It's like, I know you're full of snakes.
[02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:55.780]   I know it.
[02:44:55.780 --> 02:44:59.980]   Maybe I know it more than you do, but we'll play anyways.
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:02.340]   - Take the risk anyway.
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:04.260]   - That's right, voluntarily, right?
[02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:07.100]   It's like, and what's so cool about that is that
[02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:08.940]   even though the person you're dealing with
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:13.140]   is full of snakes, if you offer your hand in trust
[02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:16.980]   and it's real, you will evoke the best in them.
[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:18.900]   And that's true even, I've dealt with people
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:23.900]   who were pretty damn criminal and pretty psychopathic
[02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:28.180]   and sometimes dangerously so.
[02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:30.780]   And you tread very lightly when you're dealing
[02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:33.980]   with someone like that, especially if they're intoxicated.
[02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:38.980]   And even then, your best bet is that alert trust.
[02:45:38.980 --> 02:45:45.860]   It's the only, it's the fact that the only thing I know that
[02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:49.140]   I had one client who was a paranoid,
[02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:51.220]   he was paranoid psychopath.
[02:45:51.220 --> 02:45:53.060]   That's a bad combination.
[02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:54.500]   He was a bad guy, man.
[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:58.020]   He had like four restraining orders on him
[02:45:58.020 --> 02:46:00.260]   and restraining orders don't work on the sort of people
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:02.940]   that you put restraining orders on.
[02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:05.500]   And he used to be harassed now and then by,
[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:10.180]   you know, a bureaucrat in a bank with delusions of power.
[02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:13.220]   And he would say to them, he used to kind of act this out
[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:15.660]   to me when I was talking to him, he'd say,
[02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:19.460]   "I'm going to be your worst nightmare."
[02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:22.140]   And he meant it.
[02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:23.780]   And he would do it.
[02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:27.700]   He had this obsessional psychopathic vengeance
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:31.460]   that was just like right there, paranoid to the hilt
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:34.100]   and paranoid people are hyper acute.
[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:38.580]   So they're watching you for any sign of deceit
[02:46:38.580 --> 02:46:41.540]   or manipulation, and they're really good at it.
[02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:44.420]   'Cause like they're 100%, that's what paranoia is.
[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:47.140]   It's 100% focus on that.
[02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:49.820]   And even under those circumstances,
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:54.820]   if you step carefully enough, you can, maybe,
[02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:57.180]   you can avoid the acts.
[02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:58.140]   That's a good thing to know
[02:46:58.140 --> 02:47:00.220]   if you ever meet someone truly dangerous.
[02:47:00.220 --> 02:47:02.700]   - Absolutely.
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:05.460]   I believe in that, that being fragile,
[02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:07.940]   nevertheless taking that leap of trust
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:10.180]   towards another person, even when they're dangerous,
[02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:12.060]   especially when they're dangerous.
[02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:15.940]   If you care, if there's something there
[02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:18.380]   in those hills you want to find,
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:21.340]   then that's probably the only way you're going to find it
[02:47:21.340 --> 02:47:23.420]   is taking that risk.
[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:26.420]   I have to ask you about Gulag Archipelago
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:30.340]   by Solzhenitsyn that speak to this very point.
[02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:31.780]   There's so many layers to this book,
[02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:33.980]   we could talk about it forever.
[02:47:33.980 --> 02:47:38.020]   I'm sure in many ways we are talking about it forever.
[02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:41.180]   But there is sort of one of the themes captured
[02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:43.260]   in the few ways that was described through the book
[02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:45.300]   is that line between good and evil
[02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:48.580]   that runs through every human being.
[02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:52.820]   As he writes, "The line dividing good and evil
[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:55.340]   "cuts through the heart of every human being.
[02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:57.460]   "During the life of any heart,
[02:47:57.460 --> 02:47:59.700]   "this line keeps changing place.
[02:47:59.700 --> 02:48:03.500]   "Sometimes it is squeezed one way to exuberant evil,
[02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:06.060]   "and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space
[02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:07.660]   "for good to flourish.
[02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:09.780]   "One and the same human being is,
[02:48:09.780 --> 02:48:12.660]   "at various ages, under various circumstances,
[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:14.940]   "a totally different human being.
[02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:17.540]   "At times he's close to being a devil,
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:19.980]   "at times to sainthood.
[02:48:19.980 --> 02:48:22.020]   "But his name doesn't change,
[02:48:22.020 --> 02:48:24.660]   "and to that name we ascribe the whole lot,
[02:48:24.660 --> 02:48:26.500]   "good and evil."
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:27.740]   What do you think about this line?
[02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:30.220]   What do you think about this thing where we talked about
[02:48:30.220 --> 02:48:31.820]   if you give somebody a chance,
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:33.700]   you actually bring out the best in them.
[02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:36.420]   What do you think about this other aspect
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:41.420]   that throughout time that line shifts inside each person,
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:43.660]   and you get to define that shift?
[02:48:43.660 --> 02:48:45.940]   What do you think about this line?
[02:48:45.940 --> 02:48:47.600]   Are we all capable of evil?
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:50.420]   - Well, you know, the cosmic drama,
[02:48:50.420 --> 02:48:53.580]   that's Satan versus Christ.
[02:48:53.580 --> 02:48:55.700]   It's like, well, who's that about?
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:56.860]   If it's not about you.
[02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:01.500]   I'm speaking just as a psychologist,
[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:03.140]   or as a literary critic.
[02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:04.340]   Those are characters.
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:05.800]   At least they're that.
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:08.980]   Well, are they human characters?
[02:49:08.980 --> 02:49:10.660]   Well, obviously.
[02:49:10.660 --> 02:49:12.840]   Well, are they archetypal human characters?
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:14.680]   Yes.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:18.460]   What does that mean cosmically and ontologically?
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:19.660]   I don't know.
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:21.060]   Like, is the world a story?
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:23.300]   Maybe.
[02:49:23.300 --> 02:49:24.660]   - The way stories are often told
[02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:27.140]   is the characters embody a stable--
[02:49:27.140 --> 02:49:28.220]   - Those are unsophisticated.
[02:49:28.220 --> 02:49:30.420]   Not great literature, though.
[02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:32.180]   It's very rare in great literature.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:33.940]   What you have in great literature generally
[02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:35.220]   is the internal drama.
[02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:40.660]   As the literature becomes more pop, I would say,
[02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:42.940]   the characters are more unitary.
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:44.900]   So there's a real bad guy, and he's all bad,
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:47.940]   and there's a real good guy, and he's all good.
[02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:49.660]   And that's not as interesting.
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:51.500]   It's not as sophisticated.
[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.500]   When you reach Dostoevskyan heights
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:56.680]   in literary representation, or Shakespearean heights,
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:50:00.720]   you can identify with the villain.
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:05.380]   And that's when literature really reaches its pinnacle,
[02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:06.460]   in some sense.
[02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:08.660]   - And also the characters change throughout.
[02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:09.500]   They shift throughout.
[02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:11.260]   They're unpredictable throughout.
[02:50:11.260 --> 02:50:14.500]   Taking the speaking of Russia more seriously recently.
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:16.340]   And I've gotten to talk to translators
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:20.740]   of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and Chekhov,
[02:50:20.740 --> 02:50:23.260]   and those kinds of folks, and you get the,
[02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:25.980]   one of the mistakes that translators made
[02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:28.380]   with Dostoevsky for the longest time
[02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:30.740]   is they would, quote unquote,
[02:50:30.740 --> 02:50:34.940]   fix the chaotic mess that is Dostoevsky.
[02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:38.900]   Because there was a sense like he was too rushed
[02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:39.980]   in his writing.
[02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:41.660]   It seemed like there was tangents
[02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:43.580]   that had nothing to do with anything.
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:46.580]   The characters were unpredictable and not inconsistent.
[02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:49.460]   There's parts of phrases that seemed to be incomplete.
[02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:50.460]   That kind of stuff.
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:52.300]   And what they realized, that is,
[02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:55.260]   that's not, that's actually crafted that way.
[02:50:55.260 --> 02:50:58.580]   It's not, it's like editing James Joyce,
[02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:00.020]   like Finnegan's Wake or something,
[02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:01.740]   because it doesn't make any sense.
[02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:03.700]   They realized that that is the magic of it.
[02:51:03.700 --> 02:51:05.940]   That captures the humanity of these characters,
[02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:07.100]   that they are unpredictable.
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:08.780]   They change throughout time.
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:11.220]   There's a bunch of contradictions.
[02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:12.580]   On which point, I gotta ask,
[02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:15.260]   is there a case to be made that Brothers Karamazov
[02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:17.020]   is the greatest book ever written?
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:20.180]   - Yeah, there's a case to be made for that.
[02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:21.020]   I don't know.
[02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:23.020]   Is it better than Crime and Punishment?
[02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:23.980]   - Yes, yeah.
[02:51:23.980 --> 02:51:24.860]   - You think so?
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:26.740]   Why do you, I'm not arguing with it.
[02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:28.060]   Why do you think that?
[02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:30.420]   - Well, every book is a person.
[02:51:30.420 --> 02:51:32.740]   Some of my best friends are inside that book.
[02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:34.060]   - Yeah, it's an amazing book.
[02:51:34.060 --> 02:51:35.700]   There's no doubt about it.
[02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:39.900]   - I think it's, some books are defined
[02:51:39.900 --> 02:51:41.340]   by your personal relationship with them.
[02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:42.580]   And that one was definitive.
[02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:44.660]   And I almost graduated to that one,
[02:51:44.660 --> 02:51:46.580]   because for the longest time,
[02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:51.300]   The Idiot was my favorite book of all.
[02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:53.980]   'Cause I identified with the ideas
[02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:55.660]   represented by Prince Mishkin.
[02:51:55.660 --> 02:51:56.660]   I also identified--
[02:51:56.660 --> 02:51:58.180]   - Ah, that's interesting.
[02:51:58.180 --> 02:52:00.540]   - To Prince Mishkin as a human being.
[02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:01.540]   - The holy fool.
[02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:02.380]   - The fool, yeah.
[02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:05.740]   Because the world kind of, my whole life,
[02:52:05.740 --> 02:52:08.660]   still kind of sees me, saw me in my perception,
[02:52:08.660 --> 02:52:12.860]   my narrow perception as kind of the fool.
[02:52:12.860 --> 02:52:17.620]   And I, different from the interpretation
[02:52:17.620 --> 02:52:19.860]   that a lot of people take of this book,
[02:52:19.860 --> 02:52:21.860]   I see him as a kind of hero.
[02:52:21.860 --> 02:52:22.820]   To be-- - Oh, definitely.
[02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:26.780]   - To be a naive, quote unquote, fool,
[02:52:26.780 --> 02:52:29.940]   but really just a naive optimist.
[02:52:29.940 --> 02:52:31.780]   And naive in the best possible way.
[02:52:31.780 --> 02:52:33.220]   I do believe that--
[02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:34.540]   - That's childlike.
[02:52:34.540 --> 02:52:36.260]   - Yeah, childlike is a better,
[02:52:36.260 --> 02:52:38.460]   so naive is usually seen as--
[02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:39.700]   - That's childish naive.
[02:52:39.700 --> 02:52:42.500]   - Yeah, but childlike.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:45.380]   That's why no one enters the kingdom of heaven
[02:52:45.380 --> 02:52:48.100]   unless they become like a child.
[02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:49.300]   That's Prince Mishkin.
[02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:50.980]   Dostoevsky knew that.
[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:52.380]   So that's why you like the idiot.
[02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:53.700]   That's so interesting.
[02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:55.460]   See, I think I like "Crime and Punishment"
[02:52:55.460 --> 02:52:57.300]   because while you identified with Mishkin,
[02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:59.820]   I think I identified more with Raskolnikov.
[02:52:59.820 --> 02:53:02.100]   Because I was tempted by Luciferian intellect,
[02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:06.260]   you know, in a manner very similar
[02:53:06.260 --> 02:53:07.860]   to the manner he was tempted.
[02:53:07.860 --> 02:53:10.580]   But I mean, I think you can make a case
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:13.380]   that the Brothers Karamazov is Dostoevsky's
[02:53:13.380 --> 02:53:15.180]   crowning achievement.
[02:53:15.180 --> 02:53:16.940]   - Well-- - And that's something, man.
[02:53:16.940 --> 02:53:18.540]   He ruined literature for me.
[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:22.660]   'Cause everything else just felt insipid afterwards.
[02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:25.420]   Not everything, not everything.
[02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:29.980]   I found some books that, in my experience,
[02:53:29.980 --> 02:53:31.940]   hit that pinnacle.
[02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:34.260]   "The Master and Margarita."
[02:53:34.260 --> 02:53:35.420]   That's a deadly book.
[02:53:35.420 --> 02:53:36.900]   I've read that, I think, four times.
[02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:40.060]   And I still, there's still, it's unbelievably deep.
[02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:43.460]   There's a Nikos Kazantzikas, a Greek writer.
[02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:48.860]   Some of his books are, his writing is amazing as well.
[02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:50.860]   - Did you ever connect with the literary,
[02:53:50.860 --> 02:53:52.900]   like existentialist Camus,
[02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:58.820]   or people like Hermann Hesse, or even Kafka?
[02:53:58.820 --> 02:54:00.380]   Did you ever connect with those--
[02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:01.340]   - To the same degree?
[02:54:01.340 --> 02:54:02.180]   - Yeah, to the same--
[02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:03.620]   - Enough to be an influence.
[02:54:03.620 --> 02:54:08.380]   You know, you have to be deaf in some fundamental sense
[02:54:08.380 --> 02:54:13.300]   not to encounter a great dead friend and fail to learn.
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:15.860]   No, and I mean, I tried to separate the wheat
[02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:17.580]   from the chaff when I read.
[02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:19.500]   You know, and I read all the great clinicians,
[02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:21.220]   all of them, perhaps not.
[02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:25.340]   Those who are foremost in the pantheon.
[02:54:25.340 --> 02:54:28.060]   And I tried to pull out what I could, and that was a lot.
[02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:29.340]   I learned a lot from Freud.
[02:54:29.340 --> 02:54:31.180]   I learned a lot from Rogers.
[02:54:31.180 --> 02:54:33.860]   And I learned a lot from, well, from Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.
[02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:36.140]   I'm gonna do a course on Dostoevsky and Nietzsche
[02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:37.460]   for this Peterson Academy.
[02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:39.260]   This is coming up in January.
[02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:40.700]   - Oh, that'll be, them together.
[02:54:40.700 --> 02:54:41.900]   - I'm really looking forward to it.
[02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:43.940]   - You're weaving.
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:45.940]   - I hadn't thought about doing them together.
[02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:46.780]   That'd be fun.
[02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:47.980]   That's a good idea.
[02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:49.140]   That'd be a good idea.
[02:54:49.140 --> 02:54:50.620]   (laughing)
[02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:51.460]   - There's an interesting--
[02:54:51.460 --> 02:54:53.140]   - I wouldn't steal that idea.
[02:54:53.140 --> 02:54:55.420]   - You often weave them together really masterfully
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:55:00.420]   because there is religious, in the broad sense of that word,
[02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:03.620]   themes throughout the writing of both.
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:05.660]   - Yeah, well, there's uncanny parallelisms
[02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:07.860]   in their writing and their lives.
[02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:12.180]   So, and Dostoevsky's deeper than Nietzsche,
[02:55:12.180 --> 02:55:15.580]   but that's because he was a writer of fiction.
[02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:18.020]   - Nietzsche is almost a character in a Dostoevsky novel.
[02:55:18.020 --> 02:55:19.620]   - He is definitely that.
[02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:21.380]   He is definitely that, yes.
[02:55:21.380 --> 02:55:24.820]   Apparently, Nietzsche knew more about Dostoevsky
[02:55:24.820 --> 02:55:25.740]   than people had thought.
[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:27.940]   There's been some recent scholarship on that grounds.
[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:29.780]   Dostoevsky didn't know anything about Nietzsche,
[02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:30.900]   as far as I know.
[02:55:30.900 --> 02:55:32.340]   I could be wrong about that.
[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:35.300]   But the thing that Dostoevsky had over Nietzsche
[02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:37.660]   is Nietzsche had to make things propositional
[02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.540]   in some real sense, 'cause he was a philosopher.
[02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:42.420]   And it's hard to propositionalize things
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:46.460]   that are outside your ken, but you can characterize them.
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:49.340]   And so, in "The Brothers Karamazov,"
[02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:54.180]   Ivan is a more developed character than Ilyosha,
[02:55:54.180 --> 02:55:56.340]   in the explicit sense.
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:55:58.100]   He can make better arguments.
[02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:01.300]   But Ilyosha wins, like Mishkin,
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:02.860]   because he's the better man.
[02:56:02.860 --> 02:56:05.820]   And Dostoevsky can show that in the actions.
[02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:08.820]   He can't render it entirely propositional,
[02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:10.260]   but that's probably because what's good
[02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:12.740]   can't be rendered entirely propositional.
[02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:14.820]   And so, Dostoevsky had that edge over Nietzsche.
[02:56:14.820 --> 02:56:17.460]   He said, well, Ivan is this brilliant rationalist,
[02:56:17.460 --> 02:56:21.500]   atheist, materialist, and puts forward an argument
[02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:23.460]   on that front that's still unparalleled,
[02:56:23.460 --> 02:56:26.860]   as far as I'm concerned, and overwhelms Ilyosha,
[02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:30.860]   who cannot respond, but Ilyosha's still the better man.
[02:56:30.860 --> 02:56:32.620]   So, which is very interesting, you know,
[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:34.260]   that- - Well, you know,
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:35.860]   the funny thing about those two characters
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:39.620]   is you, Jordan Peterson, seem to be somebody
[02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:42.540]   that at least in part embodies both,
[02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:45.660]   because you are one of the intellectuals of our time,
[02:56:45.660 --> 02:56:50.660]   rigorous in thought, but also are able to have that kind of,
[02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:52.740]   what would you describe?
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:56.000]   If you remove the religiosity of Ilyosha,
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:59.700]   there's a, what's a good word?
[02:56:59.700 --> 02:57:00.860]   Love towards the world?
[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:03.020]   - Spirit of encouragement.
[02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:04.500]   - Yes.
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:06.060]   - Which one- - Yeah, well, it's, you know,
[02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:08.860]   one of the things I did learn, perhaps,
[02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:10.820]   from looking into the abyss to the degree
[02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:14.860]   that I have had to, or was willing to,
[02:57:14.860 --> 02:57:18.040]   was that at some level, you have to make
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:20.580]   a fundamental statement of faith.
[02:57:20.580 --> 02:57:23.100]   When God creates the world, after each day,
[02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:25.680]   he says, he saw that it was good.
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:28.180]   You think, well, is it good?
[02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:29.940]   It's like, well, there's a tough question.
[02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:31.780]   You know, do you wanna bring a child
[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:35.060]   into a world such as this, which is a fundamental question
[02:57:35.060 --> 02:57:36.460]   of whether or not it's good.
[02:57:36.460 --> 02:57:40.420]   It's an act of faith to declare that it's good,
[02:57:40.420 --> 02:57:43.160]   because the evidence is ambivalent.
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:46.340]   And so then you think, okay, well,
[02:57:46.340 --> 02:57:49.540]   am I gonna act as if it's good?
[02:57:49.540 --> 02:57:53.340]   And what would happen if I did?
[02:57:53.340 --> 02:57:55.540]   And maybe the answer to that is,
[02:57:55.540 --> 02:57:56.940]   I think this is the answer.
[02:57:56.940 --> 02:57:59.700]   (pages rustling)
[02:57:59.700 --> 02:58:08.380]   The more you act out the proposition that it's good,
[02:58:08.380 --> 02:58:09.420]   the better it gets.
[02:58:09.420 --> 02:58:14.820]   And so that's, Dostoevsky said, this is something else.
[02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:17.700]   Every man is not only responsible for everything he does,
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:20.140]   but for everything everyone else does.
[02:58:20.140 --> 02:58:22.940]   It's like, what, is that profound,
[02:58:22.940 --> 02:58:24.980]   or are you just insane?
[02:58:24.980 --> 02:58:29.740]   Then you think, is what you receive back proportionate
[02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:30.780]   to what you deliver?
[02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:34.380]   And the answer to that might be yes.
[02:58:34.380 --> 02:58:36.780]   That's a terrifying idea, man.
[02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:38.580]   And it's certainly, you can see that it's true
[02:58:38.580 --> 02:58:43.580]   in some sense, because people certainly respond to you
[02:58:43.580 --> 02:58:45.660]   in kind with how you treat them.
[02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:46.820]   That's certainly the case.
[02:58:46.820 --> 02:58:49.740]   - I mean, it's terrifying and it's exciting.
[02:58:49.740 --> 02:58:50.580]   - Yeah, right.
[02:58:50.580 --> 02:58:53.380]   But that's an adventure, isn't it?
[02:58:53.380 --> 02:58:58.380]   So, yeah, you create the world by the way you live it.
[02:58:58.380 --> 02:59:03.340]   The world you experience is defined
[02:59:03.340 --> 02:59:05.020]   by the way you live that world.
[02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:06.840]   And that's really interesting.
[02:59:06.840 --> 02:59:08.420]   And then taken as a collective,
[02:59:08.420 --> 02:59:10.700]   we create the world together in that way.
[02:59:10.700 --> 02:59:12.860]   What do you think is the meaning of it all?
[02:59:12.860 --> 02:59:15.100]   What's the meaning of life, Jordan Peterson?
[02:59:15.100 --> 02:59:18.100]   We've defined it many, many times
[02:59:18.100 --> 02:59:19.180]   throughout this conversation.
[02:59:19.180 --> 02:59:21.280]   - It's the adventure along the route, man.
[02:59:22.340 --> 02:59:26.980]   And I would say, where's that adventure to be found?
[02:59:26.980 --> 02:59:28.200]   In faith?
[02:59:28.200 --> 02:59:29.800]   What's the faith?
[02:59:29.800 --> 02:59:32.840]   The highest value is love and truth is its handmaiden.
[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:36.820]   That's a statement of faith, right?
[02:59:36.820 --> 02:59:38.260]   'Cause you can't tell.
[02:59:38.260 --> 02:59:42.660]   You have to act it out to see if it's true.
[02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:46.300]   And so you can't even find out without,
[02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:47.860]   and that's so peculiar,
[02:59:47.860 --> 02:59:50.780]   you have to make the commitment a priori.
[02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:53.620]   It's like a marriage, it's the same thing.
[02:59:53.620 --> 02:59:56.820]   It's like, well, is this the person for me?
[02:59:56.820 --> 02:59:58.120]   That's the wrong question.
[02:59:58.120 --> 03:00:01.820]   How do I find out if this is the person for me?
[03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:05.240]   By binding myself to them.
[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:09.280]   Well, maybe the same thing's true of life, right?
[03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:10.680]   You bind yourself to it.
[03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:13.420]   And the tighter you bind yourself to it,
[03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:15.620]   the more you find out what it is.
[03:00:15.620 --> 03:00:18.060]   And that's like a radical embrace.
[03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:20.000]   And it's a really radical embrace.
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:21.260]   That's the crucifix symbol.
[03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:23.620]   And more than that, because like I said,
[03:00:23.620 --> 03:00:27.100]   the full passion story isn't death.
[03:00:27.100 --> 03:00:29.240]   It isn't even unjust death.
[03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:31.400]   It isn't even unjust death
[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:34.100]   and the crucifixion of the innocent,
[03:00:34.100 --> 03:00:36.380]   which is really getting pretty bad.
[03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:41.380]   It's unjust, torturous, innocent death,
[03:00:41.380 --> 03:00:47.360]   attendant upon betrayal and tyranny, followed by hell.
[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:51.460]   Well, that's a hell of a thing to radically embrace.
[03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:52.620]   It's like, bring it on.
[03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:58.740]   - I think a lot of people put truth as the highest ideal
[03:00:58.740 --> 03:01:03.740]   and think they can get to that ideal
[03:01:03.740 --> 03:01:05.900]   while living in a place of cynicism
[03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:07.700]   and ultimately escape from life
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:10.020]   and hiding from life, afraid of life.
[03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:13.940]   And it's beautifully put that love
[03:01:13.940 --> 03:01:18.100]   is the highest ideal to reach for, and truth is--
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:19.080]   - It's handmaiden.
[03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:21.080]   I thought about that for a long time, right?
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:23.020]   This hierarchy of ideal.
[03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:25.560]   And the thing about truth, that bitter truth, let's say,
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:30.560]   that cynical truth is it can break the shackles of naivety.
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:36.180]   And actually, a burnt cynicism is a moral improvement
[03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:38.920]   over a blind naivety,
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:42.560]   even though one is in some ways positive,
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:44.200]   but only because it's protected.
[03:01:44.200 --> 03:01:47.360]   And the other is bitter and dark, but still better.
[03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:49.500]   But you're not done at that point.
[03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:51.320]   You're just barely started.
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:53.100]   It's like, you're cynical?
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:54.460]   You're not cynical enough.
[03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:57.060]   It's like, how cynical are you?
[03:01:57.060 --> 03:02:00.920]   Are you, I'm an Auschwitz prison guard level of cynical?
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:05.560]   'Cause you have to go down pretty deep into the weeds
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:07.220]   before you find that part of you,
[03:02:07.220 --> 03:02:09.420]   but you can find it if you want.
[03:02:09.420 --> 03:02:11.820]   And then you think, well, I want to stop this.
[03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:14.420]   Well, that was the question you posed.
[03:02:14.420 --> 03:02:16.040]   In some sense, you're obsessed with, say,
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:19.180]   what happened on these mass scale catastrophes
[03:02:19.180 --> 03:02:21.380]   in the communist countries.
[03:02:21.380 --> 03:02:24.740]   It's like, well, millions of people participated.
[03:02:24.740 --> 03:02:28.960]   So you could have, and maybe you would have enjoyed it.
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:30.940]   So what part of that is you?
[03:02:30.940 --> 03:02:33.460]   And you can find it if you want.
[03:02:33.460 --> 03:02:36.180]   - Yeah, it's all there.
[03:02:36.180 --> 03:02:39.220]   The prisoner, the interrogator, the--
[03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:42.700]   - Judas, Pontius Pilate.
[03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:43.540]   - All of it. - All of it.
[03:02:43.540 --> 03:02:46.180]   And all of it is inside us.
[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.020]   - Yeah.
[03:02:47.020 --> 03:02:48.820]   - And you just have to look.
[03:02:48.820 --> 03:02:52.660]   And once you do, maybe eventually you can find the love.
[03:02:52.660 --> 03:02:54.580]   Jordan, you're an incredible human being.
[03:02:54.580 --> 03:02:56.980]   I'm deeply honored you would talk to me.
[03:02:56.980 --> 03:02:59.740]   Thank you for being a truth seeker in this world,
[03:02:59.740 --> 03:03:01.540]   and thank you for the love.
[03:03:01.540 --> 03:03:04.040]   - Hey, thanks for the invitation, man.
[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:06.580]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:03:06.580 --> 03:03:07.860]   with Jordan Peterson.
[03:03:07.860 --> 03:03:09.100]   To support this podcast,
[03:03:09.100 --> 03:03:11.660]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:03:11.660 --> 03:03:13.740]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:15.100]   from Friedrich Nietzsche.
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:18.140]   You must have chaos within you
[03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:20.420]   to give birth to a dancing star.
[03:03:20.420 --> 03:03:24.580]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:27.160]   (upbeat music)
[03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:29.740]   (upbeat music)
[03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:33.320]   (Session concluded at 4pm)
