[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   The following is a conversation with Sarah Seager,
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.600]   a planetary scientist at MIT,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.280]   known for her work on the search for exoplanets,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.960]   which are planets outside of our solar system.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.760]   She's an author of two books on this fascinating topic.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.320]   Plus, in a couple days, August 18th,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.280]   her new book, a memoir,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.680]   called "The Smallest Lights in the Universe" is coming out.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.000]   I read it and I can recommend it highly,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.520]   especially if you love space
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.720]   and are a bit of a romantic like me.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.240]   It's beautifully written.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.560]   She weaves the stories of the tragedies
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.200]   and the triumphs of her life
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.040]   with the stories of her love for
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.640]   and research on exoplanets,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.240]   which represent our hope to find life
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.280]   out there in the universe.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.640]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   Three sponsors, Public Goods,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.440]   that's a new one, PowerDot, and Cash App.

[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.860]   It really is the best way to support this podcast.
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.880]   As a quick side note, let me say that extraterrestrial life,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.640]   aliens, I think represent our civilization longing
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.920]   to make contact with the unknown,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.560]   with others like us,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280]   or maybe others that are very different from us,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.160]   entities that might reveal something profound
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.760]   about why we're here.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.400]   The possibility of this is both exciting
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.160]   and, at least to me, terrifying,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.280]   which is exactly where we humans do our best work.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.760]   If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.840]   review it with Five Stars and Apple Podcast,

[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.440]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.780]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.120]   that could break the flow of the conversation.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.900]   I try to make these ad reads interesting if you do listen,
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.620]   but if you like, I give you timestamps
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.680]   so you can skip to the conversation,
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.160]   but still, please do check out the sponsors

[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.640]   It's the best way to support this podcast.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.600]   This show is sponsored by Public Goods,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.560]   the one-stop shop for affordable, sustainable,
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.720]   healthy household products.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.380]   Their products have a minimalist black and white design
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.960]   that I find to be just clean, elegant, and beautiful.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.520]   It's a style that makes me feel
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.400]   like I'm living in the future.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   I imagine we'll all be using Public Goods products
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.380]   once we colonize Mars.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.120]   They got all the basics you need from healthy snacks
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.680]   like almonds to my favorite, the bamboo toothbrush,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.760]   and other stuff for personal care, home essentials,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   healthy food, and vitamins and supplements.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.360]   I take their fish oil, for example,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.000]   which I recommend highly for everyone.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.440]   They use a membership model to keep costs low
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.720]   and pass on the savings to us, the people.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.600]   They plant one tree for every order placed
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.660]   and have planted over 100,000 trees
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.900]   since September 2019.

[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.800]   It's an e-stim, electrical stimulation device
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.680]   that I've been using a lot for muscle recovery,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.720]   mostly for my shoulders and legs
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.820]   as I've been doing the crazy amounts
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.080]   of body weight reps and six miles every other day now
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.560]   after the challenge.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.460]   Yes, I'm still doing it.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.840]   They call it the smart muscle stimulator
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.920]   since the app that goes with it is amazing.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.000]   It has 15 programs for different body parts
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360]   and guides you through everything you need to do.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.200]   I take recovery really seriously these days
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.440]   and PowerDot has been a powerful addition
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.720]   to stretching, ice, massage, and sleep and diet.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.800]   It's used by professional athletes
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.120]   and by slightly insane but mostly normal people like me.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.040]   It's portable so you can throw it in a bag
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.360]   and bring it anywhere.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   Get it at PowerDot.com/lex and use code LEX at checkout

[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.560]   This show is presented by a sponsor
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.280]   that arguably made this whole podcast even possible,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.800]   our first sponsor, the great, the powerful Cash App,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.080]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.800]   I will forever be grateful to them
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.500]   for sponsoring this podcast.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.080]   They're awesome people, awesome company, awesome product.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.200]   Okay, back to the read.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.360]   When you get it, use code LEX podcast.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.520]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.440]   buy Bitcoin, invest in the stock market
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   with as little as $1.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.760]   Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.680]   let me mention that cryptocurrency
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.480]   in the context of the history of money is fascinating.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.800]   I recommend "The Scent of Money"
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   as a great book on this history.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.320]   Debits and credits on ledgers
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.440]   started around 30,000 years ago.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.880]   Time flies.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.440]   The US dollar created over 200 years ago
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.320]   and the first decentralized cryptocurrency
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.480]   released just over 10 years ago.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.800]   So given that history,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720]   cryptocurrency is still very much
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.600]   in its early days of development
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.160]   but it's still aiming to
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.840]   and just might redefine the nature of money.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.400]   So again, if you get Cash App
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.160]   from the App Store or Google Play
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.080]   and use code LEX podcast,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.280]   you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.640]   an organization that is helping to advance robotics
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.400]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.180]   And now here's my conversation with Sarah Seeger.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.000]   When did you first fall in love with the stars?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.160]   - I think I've always loved the stars.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.800]   One of my first memory is of the moon.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.400]   I remember watching the moon
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.680]   and I was in the car with my dad
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.040]   who my parents were divorced
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.560]   and he was driving me and my siblings
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.320]   to his house for the weekend
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.040]   and the moon was just following me.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.880]   Just had no idea why that was.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.920]   - Yeah, so like looking up at the sky
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.720]   and there's this glowing thing.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.240]   How do you make sense of the moon at that age?
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.320]   - At that age, like age five,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.980]   there's just no way you can.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.920]   I think it's one of the great things about being a kid.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.800]   It's just that curiosity that all kids have.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.080]   - You know, I was thinking 'cause there's these
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.240]   almost out there ideas that our earth is flat
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.280]   floating about on the internet.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.360]   And it made me think, you know,
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   when did I first realize that the earth is like this ball
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.820]   that's flying through empty space?
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.480]   I mean, it's terrifying, it's awe-inspiring.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.200]   I don't know how to make sense of it.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.280]   - It's hard 'cause we live in our frame of reference
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.800]   here on this planet.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.720]   It's nearly impossible.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.560]   None of us are lucky to go to see the curvature of earth.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.400]   - I mean, do you remember when you realized,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.760]   understood like the physics,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.620]   like the layout of the solar system?
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.200]   Was it like, did you first have to take physics
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.440]   to really, like high school physics to really take that in?
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.520]   - I think it's hard to say.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.160]   I had this book when I was a child.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.180]   It was in French.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.440]   I grew up in Canada where French is supposedly taught
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.600]   to all of us English speaking Canadians.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.960]   And it was this book in French,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.080]   but it was about the solar system.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.040]   And I just loved flipping through it.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.060]   It's hard to say how much you or I understand
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.420]   when we're kids, but it was really a great book.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.960]   - What about the stars?
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.480]   When'd you first learn about the stars?
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.440]   - I have like, I do have this very incredible
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.840]   distinctive memory.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   And again, it had to do with my dad.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.080]   He took us camping.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.480]   Now my dad was from the UK and he was the type
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.960]   who you'd find wearing a tie on weekends.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.200]   So camping was not in his fear, his comfort zone.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.040]   We had a babysitter.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.600]   Every summer we got a baby,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.400]   every summer we had a babysitter.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.600]   And one summer we had Tom.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.320]   He was barely older than we were.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.840]   He was 14, my brother was 12.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.200]   I would have been 11 or 10 maybe.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.920]   And we went camping because Tom said camping's the thing.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.000]   We should try it.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.060]   And I just remember, I didn't aim to see the stars,
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.640]   but I walked out of my tent in the middle of the night
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.080]   and I looked up and wow, so many stars.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.280]   The dark night sky and all those stars
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.040]   just like screaming at me.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.920]   I just couldn't believe that.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.380]   Honestly, like my first thought was this is so incredible.
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.520]   Mind-blowing.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.200]   Like why wouldn't anyone have told me this existed?
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.800]   - Can anyone else see this?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.240]   - Have you had an experience like that with anything?
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.080]   - Yeah, I've had that.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.480]   I mean, I don't know if maybe you can tell me
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.600]   if it's the same.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.800]   I've had that with robots.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.120]   There's a few robots I've met
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.560]   where I just fell in love with this.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.080]   Like is anyone else seeing this?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   Is anyone else seeing that here in a robot
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   is our ability to engineer some intelligent beings,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.940]   intelligent beings that we could love, that could love us,
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.460]   that we can interact with in some rich ways
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.540]   that we haven't yet discovered.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.380]   Like almost like when you get a puppy instead of a dog
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.100]   and there's this immediate bond and love.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.260]   And on top of that ability to engineer it,
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.800]   it was, I had to just pause and hold myself.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.960]   I imagine, I don't have kids.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.220]   I imagine there's a magic to that as well,
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.100]   where it's a totally new experience.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.460]   It's like, what?
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.740]   - Well, yeah, the stars though, unlike kids or the puppy,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.900]   it's only a good thing.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.420]   (both laughing)
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.780]   - So you felt, you weren't terrified?
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.820]   Like to me, when I look at the stars,
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.380]   it's almost paralyzingly scary
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.220]   how little we know about the universe, how alone we are.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.140]   I mean, somehow it feels alone.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.060]   I'm not sure if it's just a matter of perspective,
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.060]   but it feels like, wow, there's billions of them out there
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.180]   and we know nothing about them.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.900]   And then also immediately to me,
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.960]   somehow mortality comes into it.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.220]   I mean, how did that make you feel at that time?
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.160]   - I think as a child without articulating it,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.680]   I felt that same way.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.400]   Just like, wow, this is terrifying.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.480]   What's out there?
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.520]   Like, what is this?
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.180]   What does it mean about us here?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.700]   - You're a scientist, an ex-world-class scientist,
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.080]   planetary scientist, astronomer.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.880]   Now, I'm a bit of an idiot who likes to ask silly questions.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.440]   So some questions are a little bit
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   in the realm of speculation, almost philosophical,
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.640]   'cause we know so little.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.520]   And one of the awesome things about your work
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.620]   is you've actually put data and real science
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.080]   behind some of the biggest questions
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.460]   that we're all curious about.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.280]   But nevertheless, many of the questions
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.520]   might be a little bit speculative.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.040]   So on that topic, just in your sense,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.040]   do you think we're alone in the universe, human beings?
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.720]   Do you think there's life out there?
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.160]   - Well, Lex, the funny thing is is that as a scientist,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.680]   I so don't even wanna answer that.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.560]   - You really? - No, I will answer it, though.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.800]   But I just love to say-- - You resist it naturally?
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.040]   - Yeah, we naturally resist that
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.720]   because we want numbers and hard facts and not speculation.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.080]   But I do love that question.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.820]   It's a great question, and it's one we all wonder about.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.880]   But I have to give you the scientist's answer first.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.720]   - Yeah, sure. (laughs)
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.240]   - Which is we'll have the capability to answer that question.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.220]   Soon, even, starting soon.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.800]   - How do you define soon?
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.060]   - How do I define soon?
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.000]   - So much happened in the last 100 years.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.220]   - Right, right, right, right.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.240]   And there's a difference, right,
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.720]   if it's 10 years or 20 years or 100 years.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.880]   Yeah, there's a difference in that.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.920]   Well, soon could be a decade or two decades.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.760]   - And the answer-- - By the way,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.800]   journalists usually don't like that,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.080]   or the people want tomorrow, they want the news.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.040]   But what it's gonna take is telescopes, space telescopes,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.320]   or very sophisticated ground or space-based telescopes
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.560]   to let us study the atmospheres of other planets far away
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.080]   and to look what's in the atmospheres
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.560]   and to look for water, which is needed for life as we know it
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.200]   to look for gases that don't belong
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.960]   that we might attribute to life.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.560]   So we have to do some really nitty-gritty astronomy.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.560]   - So the promising way to answer this question
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.340]   scientifically is to look for hints of life.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.640]   That's where many of your ideas come in
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.120]   of what kind of hints might we actually see about this life.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.800]   - Right, right, that's exactly what we need to do.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.360]   And I like the word you chose, hint,
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.440]   because it's gonna be a hint.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.280]   It's not gonna be a 100% yay, we found it.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.560]   And then it will take future generations
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.440]   to do more careful work to hopefully even find a way
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.640]   to send a probe to these distant exoplanets
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.880]   and to really figure this out for us.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.440]   - I mean, we'll talk about the details.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.540]   Those are fun, but like--
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.660]   - Back to the speculation.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.500]   - The zoomed out big picture speculation question.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.820]   - The zoomed out big picture is yes,
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.640]   I believe absolutely there is life out there somewhere.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.620]   Because the vastness of the universe is incredible.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.660]   It's so breathtaking.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.840]   When we look at the night sky,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.180]   if you can go to that dark sky,
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.560]   you can see many, many hundred,
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.220]   or even if you have good eyesight
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.260]   and you're somewhere very dark,
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.360]   you could see thousands of stars.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.740]   But in our galaxy, we have hundreds of billions of stars.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.520]   And our universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.960]   So think about all those stars out there.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.900]   And even if planets are rare, even if life is rare,
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.140]   just because the number of stars is so huge,
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.280]   things have to come together
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.080]   somewhere, someplace in our universe.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.780]   - Yeah, it's so amazing to think that somebody
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.780]   might be looking up on another planet
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.460]   in a distant galaxy.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.440]   - I have to interrupt your reverie and get back to,
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.600]   in our lifetime at least, the short term.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.640]   We have to, we only have the nearest stars to look at.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.200]   It's true that there are so many stars,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.820]   so many hosts for planets that might have life.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.600]   But in the practical question of will we find it,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.960]   it has to be a star quite close to Earth.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.480]   Like a few light years, tens of light years,
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.000]   maybe hundreds of light years.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.560]   - And by the way, you've introduced me
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.240]   to a tool of Eyes on Exoplanets, I think,
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.840]   that NASA's put together.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.040]   - Eyes on Exoplanets, it's a great software
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.680]   you can download. - That's so cool.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   But anyway, can you give a sense of who our neighbors are?
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.880]   You said hundreds of light years.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.080]   Like how many stars are close by?
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.680]   What's our neighborhood like?
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.640]   We're talking about five, 10 stars
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.680]   that we might actually have a chance to zoom in on?
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.560]   - I'm talking about maybe a dozen or two dozen stars.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.240]   - And those are-- - With planets that look
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.840]   suitable for us to follow up in detail.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.960]   - For life, okay. - Right, but
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.100]   one thing that's really exciting in this field
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.920]   is that the very nearest star to Earth,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.960]   called Proxima Centauri,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.160]   it's part of the Alpha Centauri star system.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.560]   - Cool name, by the way. - Yeah, Proxima.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.480]   - Whoever names them. - Nearby.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.120]   - Okay, but it sounds cool.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.000]   - But Proxima Centauri appears to have a planet around it
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   that's about an Earth-mass planet
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.680]   in the so-called habitable zone,
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.000]   or the Goldilocks zone of the host star.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.400]   So think about how incredible that is.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.320]   Like out of all the stars out there,
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.640]   even the very nearest star has planets
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.440]   and has a planet of huge interest to us.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.800]   - Yeah, okay, so can we talk about that planet?
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.080]   What does it mean to be maybe possibly habitable?
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.840]   How does size come into play?
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   How does, what we know about gases
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.120]   and what kind of things are necessary for life?
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.320]   What are the factors that make you think
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.640]   that it's habitable?
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.440]   And by the way, maybe one way to talk about that
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.720]   is people know about the Drake equation,
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.400]   which is a very high-level, almost framework
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.480]   to think about what is the probability that,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.840]   correct me if I'm wrong, that there's life out there.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.040]   And intelligent life, I think, I don't know.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.980]   But then you have an equation named after you now,
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:56.040]   which I think nicely focuses on the more achievable
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.160]   and interesting part of that question,
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.240]   which is on whether there is habitable planets out there,
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.800]   or how many, I guess, habitable planets are.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.420]   - So the funny thing is was one time I met Frank Drake
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.920]   and I asked if he minded if I took his equation
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.440]   and kind of revamped it for this new field
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.240]   of exoplanet astronomy.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.400]   He was totally cool with it.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.240]   He's totally cool with it.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.720]   - He got total approval?
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.240]   Well, maybe, okay, so sorry.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.660]   - I'm not sure if he'd actually read the stuff
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.920]   about my equation, but he was cool with it.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.760]   He was cool with it. - He was cool with it?
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.200]   Okay, so I just said like 15 different things,
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.760]   but maybe, can you tell from your perspective
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.280]   what is the Drake equation,
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.840]   and what is, sorry, the Seeger equation?
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.320]   - Sure, well, the Drake equation,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.580]   as you said, it's a framework.
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.580]   It's a description of the number of civilizations out there
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.800]   of intelligent beings that are able to communicate with us
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.840]   by radio waves.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.240]   So if you think of the movie "Contact,"
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.920]   you've seen "Contact," right?
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.040]   We're hoping to get, we're listening in, actually.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.360]   It's an active field of research,
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.040]   listening to other stars at radio wavelengths,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.340]   hoping that some intelligent civilizations
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.080]   are sending us a message.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   And the Drake equation came like at the start
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.720]   of that whole field to put the factors down on paper
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.400]   to sort of illustrate what is involved
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.920]   to kind of estimating.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.720]   And there's no real estimate or prediction
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.600]   of how many civilizations are out there,
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.880]   but it's a way to frame the question
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.600]   and show you each term that's involved.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.760]   So I took the Drake equation
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.960]   and I called it a revised Drake equation.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.520]   And I recast it for the search for planets
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.800]   by more traditional astronomy means.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.880]   We're looking at stars, looking for planets,
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.760]   looking for rocky planets,
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.720]   looking for planets that are the right temperature for life,
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.500]   looking for planets that might have life
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.920]   that outputs gases that we might detect in the future.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.680]   It's the same spirit of the Drake equation.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.280]   It's not gonna give us any magic numbers.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.520]   So I'm gonna say, "Hey, here's exactly what's out there."
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.200]   It's meant to kind of guide of where we're going.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.520]   - Although the Drake equation did,
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.180]   I mean, the initial equation proposed actual numbers
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.360]   for those variables, right?
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.800]   - Oh, yes, the equation proposed numbers
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.280]   and you can still plug your own numbers in.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.520]   And there's this really cute website that lets you,
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.400]   for both the Drake and my revised equation,
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.080]   plug in some numbers and see what you get.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.180]   So yeah.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.920]   - So, okay, so what are the variables,
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.200]   but maybe also what are the critical variables?
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.640]   - So in my equation, I set out to what are the numbers
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.080]   of inhabited planets that show signs of life
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.680]   by way of gases in the atmosphere
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.520]   that can be attributed to life.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.440]   I could just walk through the terms, that's simpler.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.280]   - Sure, that's probably easier.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.100]   - So the first thing I say is,
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.100]   what are the number of stars available?
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.520]   And it's not that those trillions and trillions
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.600]   of stars everywhere.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.800]   It's what are available to a specific search.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.440]   And so for example, the MIT led NASA mission TESS
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.320]   is surveying the sky looking for all kinds of planets,
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.560]   but it can also, it also has stars.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.680]   It has about 30,000 red dwarf stars.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.920]   So we just take a number of stars
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.820]   that a given survey can access.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.940]   So that's what the number of stars is.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.520]   Then I wanted to know what kind of stars are quiet.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.040]   A quiet, I called it fraction of those stars that is quiet.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.000]   In the case of TESS, the way it's looking for planets
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.560]   is planets that transit the star.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.800]   They go in front of the star as seen from the telescope.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.680]   But it turns out that some stars are very active,
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.880]   they're variable, and they brighten and dim with time,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.240]   and that interferes with our observation.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.360]   - I apologize to interrupt.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.160]   So the transiting planet,
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.560]   so you're really looking for a black blob,
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.920]   essentially, that blocks the light.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.360]   - We're looking for a black blob that blocks the light.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.640]   - And then trying to say something
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.880]   about the size of the planet,
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.440]   from the frequency of that black blob's appearance,
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.560]   and the size of that black blob, that kind of thing.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.960]   - Yeah, but let's just say that out of all the stars
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.400]   there are accessible to whatever telescope,
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.560]   some of them are just bad.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.400]   For whatever reason,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.540]   you're not gonna be able to find planets around them.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.800]   So I need to know the fraction of those that are good.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.720]   So again, we have the number of stars,
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.000]   the fraction of them that we can actually
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.040]   find planets around.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.600]   - And by the way, is our sun one such,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.440]   is our sun quiet?
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.280]   - Our sun is quiet.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.120]   - Okay, good to know.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   - So I have actually two terms.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.700]   One describes how quiet they are,
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.400]   and one is if we can find a planet around that star.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.720]   These transiting planets, for example,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.520]   not all planets transit,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.720]   because the planet would have to be orbiting that star
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.080]   in this kind of plane, as viewed from you.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.560]   But if a star is, for example,
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.280]   orbiting in the plane of the sky, it will never transit.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.880]   It will never go in front of the star.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.500]   So in that case, we have to have a fraction
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.560]   that takes into account that kind of geometric factor.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.160]   - And hopefully, I mean, you can assume
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.840]   that it's uniformly distributed, hopefully.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.440]   - Yes, we can assume, and there's evidence
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.840]   that it's uniformly distributed, yes.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.000]   So then the next, so all of these factors so far,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.160]   number of stars accessible to whatever telescope
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.480]   you're thinking about, how many stars are quiet,
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.120]   fraction of stars that are quiet,
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.880]   fraction that are observable,
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.040]   in this case, for the geometric factor,
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.640]   those are all things we can measure.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.480]   And there's one more term in the Seeger equation
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.920]   we can measure.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.320]   I call it fraction of planets in the habitable zone.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.520]   Because believe it or not, we have a handle on that
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.640]   for a certain set of stars.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.320]   We know from the Kepler Space Telescope
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.360]   that operated for a number of years,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.040]   we have estimates for how many planets
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.920]   are in the so-called habitable zone of the host star
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.280]   for a certain type of star.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.840]   So all those we have measurable.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.620]   And then like the Drake equation itself,
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.840]   there are some terms we can not measure.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.540]   And those ones, I call them FL,
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.740]   fraction of all those planets that have life on them.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.280]   'Cause we don't know what that is.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.840]   And FS, I called for spectroscopy.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.580]   The fraction that have, we can use our telescope
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.780]   and instrument tools to look for light.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.840]   Actually, FS was the ones that, the planets that,
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.640]   that have life that actually gives off a gas,
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   useful gas that might accumulate in the atmosphere
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.340]   so we could eventually observe it.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.140]   - How do the FL and FS interplay?
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.020]   So these are separate terms?
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:14.860]   - Separate terms.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.400]   So for example, you could imagine,
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.640]   so for example, you could imagine life,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.200]   like us humans, we breathe out carbon dioxide.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.080]   But our planet Earth, we already have
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.740]   a lot of carbon dioxide on it.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.380]   Well, we have hundreds of parts per million,
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.480]   but it has a really strong signal.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   So us humans breathing out carbon dioxide,
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.560]   it's not helpful for any intelligent beings
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.020]   that are looking back at Earth.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.200]   'Cause there's already a lot of,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.600]   there's already enough carbon dioxide,
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.940]   we're not adding to it.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.060]   So if there is life on a planet,
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.620]   and it's outputting a boring gas,
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.580]   that's not helpful for us to uniquely identify
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:54.160]   as being made by life versus just being there anyway,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.280]   then it's not helpful.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.680]   So I separated those two terms out.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.560]   Soon, I think we'll have evidence
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.180]   that planets that can support life, at least, are common.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:08.020]   - So, okay, this is such an awesome topic.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.360]   I have a million questions.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.560]   Okay, I know this is a little bit of speculation,
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.120]   but what's your sense about that, I think, FS,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.120]   which is that life would produce interesting gases
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.700]   that we'd be able to detect?
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.000]   One, is there scientific evidence?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.560]   And second, is there some intuition
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.080]   around life producing gases,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.720]   detectable hints in terms of chemistry?
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.120]   - So interestingly enough, that entire question
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.520]   relates to, I'm gonna say almost my life's work,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.480]   the work I'm doing now,
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.280]   and the work I'm doing for the next 20 years.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.080]   And I wish I could give you a concrete number, like 1%.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.720]   Like on the worst days, it's 1%, let's say, in my mind.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.440]   You know, on the best days, it's like 80%.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.060]   And I could actually go into a lot of detail here,
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.820]   but I'll just give you the simplest things.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.480]   So first of all, we make an assumption that,
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.480]   like us and our life here on earth, life uses chemistry.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.580]   So we use chemistry 'cause we eat food, we breathe air,
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.720]   and we have metabolism to break down food,
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.680]   to get energy, to store energy,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   and then ultimately to use it.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.720]   And all life here has some kind of byproduct
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.640]   in doing all that, some kind of waste product
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.280]   that goes into the atmosphere.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.560]   So I like to think that life everywhere uses chemistry.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.960]   Some people have imagined, like,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.080]   let's imagine like a windmill, like mechanical energy,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.020]   just getting energy and using it without storing it.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.200]   And if there was life like that,
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.720]   it might not need to output a gas.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.580]   So we make this basic assumption of chemistry.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.960]   That's the first thing.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.740]   The second more complicated thing that I and my team work on
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.960]   is what happens to the gas once it is produced by life.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.860]   It goes into the atmosphere.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.660]   And a lot of gas is just destroyed immediately, actually,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.200]   by ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.480]   Oxygen's incredibly destructive to a lot of gases.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.560]   So the gas can be produced by life,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.000]   but it could be just completely destroyed
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.640]   by its environment.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.540]   - I guess we should pause on that,
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.680]   that you mentioned your life's work.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.400]   This is just a beautiful idea
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.260]   that it's kind of paralyzing when you look out there
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.260]   and you wonder, is there life out there?
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.200]   It's the first paralyzing.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.920]   Actually, before I encountered your work,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.100]   I feel like an idiot.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.100]   But it feels like there's no tool to answer that question.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.680]   And then what you kind of provided is this cool idea
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.200]   that it might be possible to answer that
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.240]   by looking at the gases.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.100]   I mean, that's a really interesting,
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.680]   that's a beautiful idea.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.880]   Yeah, so we could just pause on that.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.600]   That's a powerful tool, I think,
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.160]   to build the intuition around.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.640]   - 'Cause I was totally clueless about it.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.480]   And it's kind of exciting.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.800]   I mean, I'm sure there's folks probably early on
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.680]   in your life who were very skeptical about this notion.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.640]   Maybe I'm not sure, but generally,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.680]   you would wanna be skeptical.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.520]   It's like, well, all these kinds of other things
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.760]   could generate gases, all those kinds of things.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.840]   - Oh, that's so true.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.480]   And that's a big part of this growing field
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.760]   is how to make sure that this gas
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.600]   isn't produced by another effect.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.840]   But I do wanna, again, pausing on that and going back a bit,
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.860]   it's incredible to think,
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.400]   but at least almost 100 years ago,
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   there's a record of someone talking about
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.080]   the idea of a gas being an indicator of life elsewhere.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.960]   - Oh, that idea was floating about somewhere.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.800]   - Yes, it was totally floating about.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.520]   And it comes down to oxygen,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.320]   which on our planet fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.800]   And we rely on oxygen to breathe.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.680]   When you hear about the people on Mount Everest
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.800]   running out of air, they're really running out of oxygen.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.600]   'Cause the air is getting thinner
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.480]   as they climb up the mountain.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.040]   But without plants and bacteria,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.760]   there's bacteria that also photosynthesizes
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.600]   and produces oxygen as a waste product.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.040]   Without those, we would have virtually no oxygen.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.400]   Our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.040]   - So yeah, if you were to analyze Earth,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.560]   is oxygen the strong indicator here?
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.800]   - Oxygen's a huge indicator.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.640]   And that's what we're hoping,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.000]   that there is an intelligent civilization
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.960]   not too far from here around a planet orbiting a nearby star
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.240]   with the kind of telescopes we're trying to build.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.000]   And they're looking back at our sun
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.600]   and they've seen our Earth and they see oxygen.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.200]   And they probably won't be like 100.0% sure
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.480]   that there's life making it.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.600]   But if they go through all the possible scenarios,
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.840]   they'll be left with a pretty strong hint
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.000]   that there's life here.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.520]   - Okay, but how do you detect that type of gases
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.280]   that are on the planet from a distance?
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.880]   - And that's, going back to that,
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.960]   that's what people were skeptical about.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.000]   When I first started working on exoplanets, long time ago,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.520]   people didn't believe we would ever, ever, ever study
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.400]   an exoplanet atmosphere of any kind.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.160]   And now dozens of them are studied.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.360]   There's a whole field of people,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.480]   hundreds of people working on exoplanet atmospheres,
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.360]   actually.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.200]   - Wow.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.080]   So at first there was a point where people didn't
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.720]   even know there was exoplanets, right?
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.080]   When was the first exoplanet detected?
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.520]   - The first exoplanet around a sun-like star, anyway,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.240]   was detected in the mid-1990s.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.400]   - That was a big deal.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.800]   Kind of vaguely remember that.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.080]   - Well, at the time it was a big deal,
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.480]   but it was also incredibly controversial.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.000]   Because in planets, we only had one example
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.800]   of a planetary system, our own solar system.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.920]   And in our solar system, Jupiter, our big, massive planet,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.880]   is really far from our star.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.280]   And this first exoplanet around a sun-like star
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.800]   was incredibly close to its star.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.520]   So close that people just couldn't believe
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.080]   it was a planet, actually.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.000]   - So maybe zoom out, what the heck is an exoplanet?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.800]   - An exoplanet is our name, is the name that we call
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.760]   a planet orbiting a star other than our sun.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.600]   - Right.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.200]   Extrasolar, I guess, is the--
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.800]   - You can call it extrasolar.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.120]   Exoplanet is simpler.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.020]   But I think it's worth pausing to remember
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.080]   that each one of those stars out there
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.320]   in our night sky is a sun.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.160]   - Right.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.960]   - And our sun has planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.080]   et cetera, and so for a long time, people have wondered,
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.040]   do those other stars or other suns have planets?
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.280]   And they do, and it appears that nearly every star
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.680]   has a planet we call exoplanet.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.920]   And there are thousands of known exoplanets already.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.160]   - So there's already, yeah, there's so many things
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.640]   about space that it's hard to put into one's brain
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.400]   because it starts filling it with awe.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.020]   So yeah, if you visualize the fact that the stars
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.820]   that we see in the sky aren't just stars,
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.020]   they're like, they're suns.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.380]   And they very likely, as you're saying,
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.080]   would have planets around them.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.100]   There's all these planets roaming about
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:11.100]   in this dimly lit darkness with potentially life.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.700]   I mean, it's just mind-blowing.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.380]   But maybe can you give a brief history
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.020]   of discovering all the exoplanets?
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.180]   So there's no exoplanets in the '90s,
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.380]   and then there's a lot of exoplanets now.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.540]   So how did that come about?
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.460]   - So many planets.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.340]   How did it come about?
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.540]   Well--
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.040]   - Maybe another way to ask is what is the methodology
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.500]   that was used to discover them?
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.980]   - I can say that.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.540]   But I'd like to just say something else first.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.220]   So in exoplanets, the line between
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.180]   what is considered completely crazy
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.220]   and what is considered mainstream research,
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.500]   legit, is constantly shifting.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.740]   - This is awesome, yeah.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.020]   - So before, when I started out in exoplanets,
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.340]   it was still sketchy.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.060]   Like it wasn't considered a career or a thing,
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.140]   a place where you should be investing.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.540]   And right now, now, today,
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.060]   so many people are working in this field.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.020]   A good, I don't know, at least 1,000, probably more.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.060]   I don't know if that sounds like a lot to you,
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:10.940]   but it's a lot.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.740]   - No, it's just a legitimate field of inquiry.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.820]   - Yeah, legitimate field of inquiry.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.420]   And what's helped us is everything
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.900]   that's helped everyone else.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.660]   It's software, it's computers, it's hardware.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.500]   It's like our phones.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.180]   You have a fantastic detector in there.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.140]   They didn't always have that.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.980]   I don't know if you remember the so-called olden days.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.260]   We didn't have digital cameras.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.520]   We had film.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.340]   You take a film camera, you send the film away,
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.420]   and eventually it comes back,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.820]   and then you see your pictures.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.580]   And they could all be horrible.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.420]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.240]   - So yeah, I mean, digital.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.080]   It just changed everything.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.920]   Data changed everything.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.740]   - Yeah.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.580]   So one thing that really helped exoplanets
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.700]   were detectors that were very sensitive,
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.780]   because when we're looking for the transiting planets,
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.060]   what we're doing is we're monitoring a star's brightness
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.680]   as a function of time.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.740]   It's like click, taking a picture of the stars
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.460]   every few seconds or minutes.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.180]   And we're measuring the brightness of a star,
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.740]   like every frame.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.920]   And we're looking for a drop in brightness
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.460]   that's characteristic of a planet
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.460]   going in front of the star,
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.580]   and then finishing its so-called transit.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.520]   And to make that measurement,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.780]   we have to have precise detectors.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.280]   - And the detectors that are making the measurement,
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.920]   can you do it from Earth?
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:24.100]   Is it, are they floating about in space?
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.800]   Like what kind of telescope?
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.520]   - So on the ground, people are using telescopes,
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.340]   small telescopes that are almost just like
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.380]   a glorified telephoto lens.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.000]   And they're looking at big swaths of the sky.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.500]   And from the ground, people can find giant planets
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.700]   like the size of Jupiter.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.620]   So it's about 10 to 12 times the size of Earth.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.740]   We can find big planets,
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.180]   'cause we can reach about 1% precision.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.500]   So not sure how much technical you wanna get, but.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.740]   - Well, yeah, how many pixels are we talking about?
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.460]   Like what, you mentioned phones.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.700]   There's a bunch of megapixels, I think.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.380]   - So for exoplanets, you wanna think about it
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.140]   as like a pixel or less than a pixel.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.820]   We're not getting any information.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.640]   But to be more technical, our telescope, you know,
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.860]   spreads the light out over many pixels,
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.220]   but we're not getting information.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.220]   We're not tiling the planet with pixels.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.400]   It's just like a point of light,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.140]   or in most cases, we don't even see the planet itself,
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.740]   just the planet's effect on the star.
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.240]   But another thing that really helped was computers,
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.980]   because transiting planets are actually quite rare.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.420]   I mean, they don't all go in front of their star.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.140]   And so to find transiting planets,
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.460]   we look at a big part of the sky at once,
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.300]   or we look at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands,
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.380]   or even in some cases, millions of stars at one time.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.260]   And so, you know, you're not gonna do this by hand,
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.540]   going through a million stars, counting up the brightness.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.540]   So we have computer software and computer code
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.020]   that does the job for us and looks for a,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.320]   you know, counts the brightness and looks for a signal
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.980]   that could be due to a transiting planet.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.060]   And, you know, I just finished a job
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.260]   called deputy science director
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.340]   for the MIT-led NASA mission test.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.460]   And it was my purview to make sure
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.260]   that we got the planet candidates,
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.580]   the transiting light curves, out to the community
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.500]   so people could follow them up
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.220]   and figure out if they're actual planets or false positives.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.940]   - So publish the data so that people could just--
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.980]   - Yeah, publish the data.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.420]   - All the data scientists out there could crunch
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.020]   and see if they can discover something.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.300]   - They can discover something.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.780]   And in fact, the NASA policy for this mission
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.220]   is that all the data becomes public as soon as possible.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.620]   So anyone could, it's not as easy as it sounds, though,
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.480]   to download the data and look for planets.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.300]   But there is a group called planethunters.org,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.620]   and they take the data,
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.360]   and they actually crowdsource it out to people
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.220]   to look for planets.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.580]   Yeah, and they often find signals
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.820]   that our computers and our team missed.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.780]   - So we mentioned exoplanets.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.500]   What about Earth-like, or I don't know
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.740]   what the right distinction is,
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.820]   if it is habitable or is it Earth-like planets,
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.340]   but what are those different categories,
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.100]   and how can we tell the difference and detect each?
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.940]   - Right, right.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.220]   So we're not at Earth-like planets yet.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.640]   All the planets we're finding are so different
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.560]   from what we have in our solar system.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   They're just easier planets to find, but like--
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.400]   - In which way?
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.320]   - For example, there could be a Jupiter-sized planet
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.560]   where an Earth should be.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.640]   We find planets that are the same size as Earth,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.240]   but are orbiting way closer to their star
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.700]   than Mercury is to our sun.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.320]   And they're so close that,
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.020]   because close to a star means they also orbit faster.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.240]   And some of these hot super-Earths, we call them,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.360]   their year, their time to go around their star
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.440]   is less than a day.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.480]   And they're heated so much by their star.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.360]   They're heated so much by the star,
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.800]   we think the surface is hot enough to melt rock.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.000]   So instead of running out by the bay or the river,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.420]   you'll have like liquid lava.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.120]   There'll be liquid lava lakes on these planets, we think.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.440]   - And life can't survive--
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.280]   - Way too hot.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.200]   The molecules for life would just be,
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.240]   molecules needed for life just wouldn't be able
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.680]   to survive those temperatures.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.200]   We have some other planets.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.920]   One of the most mysterious things out there,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.600]   factoid, if you will,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.280]   is that the most common type of planet we know about so far
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.760]   is a planet that's in between Earth and Neptune size.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.560]   It's two to three times the size of Earth.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.320]   And we have no solar system counterpart of that planet.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.760]   That is like going outside to the forest
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.860]   and finding some kind of creature or animal
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.720]   that just no one has ever seen before,
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.280]   and then discovering that is the most common thing out there.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.560]   And so we're not even sure what they are.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.640]   We have a lot of thoughts
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.700]   as to the different types of planet it could be,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.520]   but people don't really know.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.840]   - I mean, what are your thoughts about what it could be?
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.680]   - Well, one thought,
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.740]   and this is more when we want to be rather than might be,
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.920]   is that these so-called mini Neptunes, we call them,
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.040]   that they are water worlds,
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.760]   that they could be scaled up versions
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.640]   of Jupiter's icy moons,
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.280]   such that they are planets that are made
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.640]   of more than half of water by mass.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.960]   - So, yeah, and what's the connection between water and life
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.240]   and the possibility of seeing that from a gas perspective?
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.480]   - Okay, so all life on Earth needs liquid water.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.360]   And so there's been this idea in astronomy or astrobiology
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.000]   for a long time called follow the water.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.320]   Find water, that will give you a chance of finding life.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.580]   But we could still zoom out,
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:21.040]   and the community consensus
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.920]   is that we need some kind of liquid for life
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.800]   to originate and to survive,
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.280]   because molecules have to react.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.620]   You don't have a way that molecules
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.460]   can interact with each other.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.660]   You can't really make anything.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.880]   And so when we think of all the liquids out there,
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.020]   water is the most abundant liquid
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.520]   in terms of planetary materials.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.140]   There really aren't that many liquids.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.560]   Like I mentioned liquid rock, way too hot for life.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.440]   We have some really cold liquids,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.360]   like almost gasoline, like ethane and methane lakes
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.700]   that have been found on one of Saturn's moons, Titan.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.840]   That's so cold, though.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.160]   And for exoplanets, we can't study really cold planets
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.300]   'cause they're just simply too dark and too cold.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.080]   So we usually are just left with
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.760]   looking for planets with liquid water.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.440]   And to your point,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.200]   you remember we talked about how planets
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.000]   are less than a pixel, in that way to say.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.560]   So we can't see oceans on a planet.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.440]   We're not gonna see continents and oceans, not yet anyway.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.840]   But we can see gases in the atmosphere.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.980]   And if it's a small rocky planet,
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.980]   and this is going into some more detail,
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.920]   if we see a small rocky planet
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.760]   with water vapor in the atmosphere,
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.100]   we're pretty sure that means
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.200]   there has to be a liquid water reservoir.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   Because it's not intuitive in any way,
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.560]   but water is broken up by ultraviolet radiation
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.080]   from the star or from the sun.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.140]   And on most planets, when water is broken up into H and O,
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.960]   the H, the hydrogen, will escape to space.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.280]   'Cause just like when you think of
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.520]   a child letting go of a helium-filled balloon,
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.920]   it floats upwards.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.720]   And hydrogen's a light gas and will leave from the planet.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.560]   So ultimately, if you have water,
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.780]   unless there's an ocean,
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.280]   like a way to keep replenishing
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.400]   water vapor in the atmosphere,
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.900]   that water vapor should be destroyed
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.240]   by ultraviolet radiation.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.040]   - Got it, so there's a, okay,
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.280]   so there's a need for a liquid.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:18.720]   I mean, I guess, is water essential or are there liquids?
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.600]   I mean, the chemistry here is probably super complicated.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.440]   - Well, there's not, it does,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.080]   but you know, there's not an infinite number of liquids.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.760]   There's maybe like five liquids that can exist inside
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.560]   or on the surface of a planet.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.280]   And water is the one that exists
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.680]   for the largest range of temperatures and pressures.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.200]   And it's also the easiest type of planet
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.400]   for us to find and study is one with water vapor,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.200]   rather than a cold planet that has ethane and methane lakes.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.680]   - What's your personal, in terms of solar systems
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.800]   and planets, that you're most hopeful about,
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.720]   in terms of our closest neighbors,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.000]   that you kind of have a sense
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.600]   that there might be somebody living over there,
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.880]   whether it's bacteria or somebody that looks like us?
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.480]   - I'm hopeful that every star nearby has a planet.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.320]   - Has some life.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.720]   - Because it almost has to for us to make progress.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.480]   We have to have that dream condition.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.040]   - So the dream condition is like,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.000]   life is just super abundant out there.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.360]   - Yeah, the dream, well, yes,
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.680]   the dream condition is that life is super abundant
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.720]   and it's based on the thought
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.640]   that if there is a planet with water and continents,
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.680]   that it also has the ingredients for life.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.800]   And that the kind of base,
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.680]   the base kernel thought is that
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.960]   if the ingredients for life is there, life will form.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.800]   - Life will form.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.640]   - That's what we're holding on to.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.280]   - With a relatively high probability.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.560]   - Yes, that's it.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.440]   - Okay, let's go into land of speculation.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.520]   What about intelligent life?
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.720]   Us humans consider ourselves intelligent,
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.760]   surprisingly or unsurprisingly.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.680]   Do you think about, from your perspective
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   of looking at planets from a gas composition perspective
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.840]   and in general of how we might see intelligent life
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.840]   and your intuition about whether that life is even out there?
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.520]   - I think the life is out there somewhere.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.560]   The huge numbers of stars and planets.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.840]   I like to think that life had a chance to evolve
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.520]   to be intelligent.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.560]   I'm not convinced the life is anywhere near here,
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.040]   only because if it's hard for intelligent life to evolve,
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.160]   then it will be far away by definition.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.040]   - Well, the sad thing is,
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.360]   maybe from the artificial intelligence perspective is,
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.740]   it makes me sad there might be intelligent life out there
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.000]   that we're just not,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.240]   like the pathways of evolution
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.920]   can go in all these different directions
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.480]   where we might not be able to communicate with it
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.520]   or even detect its intelligence
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.560]   or even comprehend its intelligence.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.320]   I'm convinced cats are more intelligent than humans
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.520]   that we're just not able to comprehend
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.920]   the proper measures of their intelligence.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.960]   - My dog is so funny.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.920]   He's the golden doodle.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.200]   His name's Leo.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.800]   We joke that he's either a really dumb dog.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.360]   And sorry, he's not here to defend himself,
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.840]   but he's either really dumb or he's a super genius,
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.160]   just pretending to be dumb.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.360]   And it's possible he's a multi-dimensional projection
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.320]   of alien life here monitoring
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.800]   one of the top scientists in the world
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.040]   trying to find aliens,
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.480]   just to make sure that humans don't get out of hand.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.400]   - That's funny.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.160]   I'm definitely gonna go in and ask him about that.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.800]   Ask him about that when I get home.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.680]   - She's onto something, yeah.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.040]   What might we look for
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.000]   in terms of signs of intelligent life?
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.680]   From your toolkit,
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.000]   do you think there are things that we should,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.360]   we might be able to use
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.640]   or maybe in the next couple of decades discover
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.480]   that would be different than life that's like bacteria,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.600]   that's primitive life?
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.800]   - I still love SETI,
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.160]   Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.520]   I like to hope that if there is a civilization out there,
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.640]   they're trying to send us a message.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.320]   I think, like, think about it.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.280]   I don't know, what are your thoughts?
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.600]   If you think about our Earth,
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.080]   there's no structure we've built
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.560]   that intelligent civilizations could see from far away.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.560]   There's literally nothing,
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.520]   not even the Great Wall of China.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.400]   And so to think, like,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.120]   why would this other civilization
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.400]   build a giant structure that we could see?
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.320]   - Yeah, so with SETI,
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.880]   the idea is that we're both trying to hear signals
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.120]   and send signals, right?
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:34.960]   - Well, we haven't sent,
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.120]   when they call that METI, messaging,
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.040]   and there's a big kind of fear over METI
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.760]   because do you wanna tell them you're here?
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.000]   It's kind of this, like, let's wait 'til they call us.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.840]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.440]   - And so, we should be-- - It's like a dating game.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.080]   You have to, like, how many days do I wait
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.600]   before I call kind of thing.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.120]   - Yes, it is, and so, but the funny thing is
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.680]   if no one's sending us a message,
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.240]   if everybody's only listening,
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.480]   how do you make progress?
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.600]   - That's right.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.320]   And I mean, but there's also,
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.920]   there's the Voyager spacecraft.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.840]   We have these little pixels of robots
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.800]   flying out all over the place.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.080]   Some of them, like the Voyager, reach out really far,
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.040]   and they have some stuff on them.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.880]   Okay, I just--
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.240]   - We do, we have the Voyager,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.040]   but they're not really going anywhere in particular,
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.760]   and they're moving very, very slowly on a cosmic scale.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.040]   - Yeah, and me saying they're far is kind of silly.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.760]   - Yeah, it's all relative in astronomy.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.960]   It's all relative, yeah.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   - Yeah, I just, so from a, if you look at Earth
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.560]   from an alien perspective,
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.240]   from visually and from gas composition,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.640]   I wonder if it's possible to determine the degree
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:46.440]   of maybe productive energy use.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.840]   I wonder if it's possible to tell
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.440]   like how busy these Earthlings are.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.560]   - Well, let's zoom out again and think about oxygen.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.800]   So when cyanobacteria arose like billions of years ago
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.200]   and figured out how to harness the energy of the sun
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.960]   for photosynthesis,
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.600]   they re-engineered the entire atmosphere.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.960]   20% of the atmosphere has oxygen now.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.360]   Like that is a huge scale.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.120]   You know, they almost poisoned everything else
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.640]   by making this what was apparently very poisonous
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.320]   to everything that was alive.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.400]   But imagine, so are we doing anything at that scale?
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.820]   Like are we changing anything at like 20% of the Earth
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.760]   with a giant structure or 20% of this or 20% of that?
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.960]   Like we aren't actually.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:30.280]   - Yeah, yeah, that's humbling to think
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.440]   that we're not actually having that much of an impact.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.040]   - I know, but we are because in a way
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.360]   we're destroying our entire planet.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.560]   But it's humbling to think that from far away
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.280]   people probably can't even tell.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.120]   - But from the perspective of the planet,
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.720]   when we say we're destroying, you know,
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.520]   global warming, all that kind of stuff,
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.320]   what we really mean is we're destroying it
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.920]   for a bunch of different species, including humans.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.800]   But like, I think the Earth will be okay.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.680]   - Oh, the Earth will be, the Earth will remain.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.080]   Whatever, whatever happens to us, the Earth will still be here.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.680]   - And it'll still be difficult to detect any difference.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.640]   Like it's sad to think that if humans destroy ourselves,
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.800]   except potentially with nuclear war,
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.520]   it would be hard to tell that anything even happened.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.080]   - Yeah, it would be hard to tell from far away
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.680]   that anything happened.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.400]   - What about, what are your thoughts,
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.040]   now this is really getting into speculation land.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   You've mentioned exoplanets were in the realm of,
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.880]   you know, there's this beautiful edge
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.320]   between science and science fiction
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.920]   that some of us, a rare few are brave enough to walk.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.880]   I think in academia, you were brave enough to do that.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.680]   I think in some sense, artificial intelligence
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.520]   sometimes walks that line a little bit.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:50.600]   There is so much excitement about extraterrestrial life
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.880]   and aliens in this world.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.600]   I mean, I don't know how to comprehend that excitement,
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.720]   but to me, it's great to see people curious
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:04.680]   'cause to me, extraterrestrial life and aliens
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:08.240]   is at the core, a scientific question.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.120]   And it's almost looks like people are excited about science.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.800]   They're excited by discovery.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.840]   - Discovery, right.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.400]   - And then the possibility that there's alien life
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.600]   that visited Earth or is here on Earth now
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   is excitement about discovery in your lifetime, essentially.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:32.960]   I mean, what do you make of that?
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   There's recent events where DARPA or DOD released footage
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:44.200]   of these unmanned aerial phenomena,
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   they're calling them now, UAP.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.040]   They got everybody like super excited,
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.160]   like maybe there is, like what's here on Earth?
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.520]   Do you follow this world of people
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.440]   who are thinking about aliens that are already here
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.400]   or have visited?
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.240]   - I don't really follow it.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.160]   They follow me, I'd say.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.560]   Because in this field, if you're a scientist of any kind,
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.000]   people contact us, me.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.600]   There's a lot of them about,
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.340]   hey, I have stuff you should see.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.820]   Hey, the aliens are already here.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.560]   I need to tell you about it.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:20.320]   And I know there are people out there who really believe.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.520]   - There's a psychology to it.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.720]   - There's a psychology to it.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.960]   - And it's fascinating.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.720]   But okay, so it's similar to artificial intelligence.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.280]   - But like you, I'm still enamored
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.000]   with the point that it is out there
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.480]   and that people believe so strongly
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.760]   and that so many people out there believe.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.440]   - Believe.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.280]   And I don't know, I'm not as allergic to it
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.480]   as some scientists are because ultimately,
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.800]   if aliens showed up or do show up or have showed up,
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.320]   these are gonna be very difficult
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.140]   to study scientific phenomena.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:58.760]   Like in fact, like going back to cats and dogs,
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   I think we should be more open-minded
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.280]   about developing new tools
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.480]   and looking for intelligent life on Earth
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.260]   that we haven't yet found.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.000]   Or even understanding the nature of our own intelligence
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.560]   'cause it kind of is an alien life form,
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.960]   the thing that's living in our skull.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   - It's so true and we don't understand consciousness.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.320]   It's true, we don't understand how.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.120]   Biology's hard, unpacking it and working it all out,
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.000]   it's a stretch.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.420]   And they say too that our thinking mind
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.680]   is like the tip of a pyramid
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.720]   and that everything else is happening under the hood.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.520]   But what is happening?
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.880]   But the thing with, so the typical scientist's response to,
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.600]   are there aliens here?
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.700]   Is that we need to see major evidence,
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.960]   not like a sketchy picture of something.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.360]   We need some cold hard evidence and we just don't have that.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.640]   - That's exactly right.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.600]   But from my perspective, I admire people that dream
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.000]   and I think that's beautiful.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.480]   The thing I don't like, there's two sides of the folks
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.760]   that probably listen to this podcast,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.680]   is those that dream I think is beautiful,
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.880]   that wander what's out there, what's here on Earth.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.820]   And then the other ones who are very conspiratorial
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.360]   and thinking that stuff is being hidden.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.740]   And it becomes about institutions.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.580]   - Right, right, right.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.780]   Okay, I have a funny thing to tell you about that.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.120]   So one of my colleagues had a really good answer to that.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.020]   And it's not me saying this so I can say this,
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.260]   but he said, look, he works with NASA, not at NASA.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.020]   He works with government, not in the government.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.380]   It's kind of mean, but he'd say, trust me,
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.340]   they couldn't hide it if they tried.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.180]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.540]   - Yeah, everybody I know.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.140]   - We're not smart enough, we're good enough.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.240]   Not we, or not me, or not you, but whoever to cover it up.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.100]   It just, it's sort of a myth.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:53.000]   - Yeah, it makes it sad because the people at NASA,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.960]   the people at MIT, the people in academia,
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.220]   the people in these institutions, and yes,
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:03.360]   even in government, are often trying,
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.160]   they're like just curious descendants of apes.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.760]   They're just, they wanna do good,
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.880]   they wanna discover stuff,
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.400]   they're not trying to hide stuff.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.180]   In fact, most of them would, in terms of leaks,
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:19.340]   would love to discover this and release this kind of stuff.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:23.320]   - Did you ever watch this show called The X-Files?
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.160]   - Yeah.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:24.980]   - Scully and Mulder?
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:25.820]   - Yeah.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.760]   - And what I love, actually,
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.780]   I used to put it up during my talks, my public talks.
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.140]   There's a picture of a UFO, or what looks like a UFO,
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.360]   and it says, I want to believe.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.060]   So that's where I think a lot of us are coming from.
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.120]   I want to believe.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.560]   And it's so great, and one time, I put that up,
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.560]   and this very, very nice couple approached me,
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.880]   really nervous afterwards, and they said,
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.640]   hey, can we take you out for lunch sometime?
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.600]   And I said, sure, and they were like the nicest people.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:56.180]   And just one of many who has an alien abduction story.
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.880]   And the woman could never have kids.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.120]   They were older, but they didn't have kids,
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.920]   which for them was a real source of regret,
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.620]   but it was because the aliens who had abducted her
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.080]   had made it so that she couldn't have kids.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:10.840]   And she had apparently something implanted behind her ear,
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.880]   which was somehow unimplanted later.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.200]   And they were just so sincere.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.720]   And they're such a lovely couple.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.760]   And they just wanted to share their story.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:23.500]   - That's a real, whatever that is, that's a real thing.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.280]   The mystery of the human mind is more powerful
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.800]   than any alien, or I mean, it's as interesting,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.880]   I think, as the universe,
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.200]   and I think they're somehow intricately linked.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.360]   Maybe getting a sense of numbers,
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.360]   how many stars are there in maybe,
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:47.280]   I don't know what the radius that's reasonable to think
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.600]   about, I don't know if the observable universe
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.960]   is like way too big to think about,
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.680]   but in terms of when we think about how many
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.560]   habitable planets there are,
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.800]   what are the numbers we're working with in your sense?
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.640]   What are the scale of-
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.100]   - Honestly, the numbers are probably like billions
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.080]   of trillions.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.040]   - Of stars.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.760]   - Yeah, you know, in the UK, I think,
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.600]   I don't know if we do that here,
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.560]   but they will call a billion trillion,
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.560]   where you put like one billion followed by a trillion.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.400]   Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.960]   But here, I don't even know how to say the number,
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.780]   10 to the 20, like if you know what that is,
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.520]   that's one followed by 20 zeros, that's a big number.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.840]   We don't even have a name for that number, there's so many.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.800]   - Per star, I think we kind of mentioned this,
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.840]   is there a good sense, there's probably argument about this,
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   but per star, how many planets are there?
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.720]   - We don't have that number yet, per se.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.960]   We're not really there, but some people think
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.120]   that there's many planets per star.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.920]   There's this analogy of filling the coffee cup.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.600]   Like, you know, you don't usually just pour one drop,
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.240]   you fill it, and that planetary systems,
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.080]   we see stars being born that have a disk of gas and dust,
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.160]   and that ultimately forms planets.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.580]   So the idea, this kind of concept is that planets,
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.840]   so many planets form too many,
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.440]   and eventually some get kicked out,
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.560]   and you're left with like a full planetary system,
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.040]   a dynamically full system, and so there have to be a lot,
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.120]   'cause so many form, and a bunch survive.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.000]   - I mean, that makes perfect intuitive sense, right?
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.280]   Like, why wouldn't that happen?
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.180]   - Right, well, there's other thoughts too, though.
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.760]   These big planets that are really close to the star,
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.080]   we think they formed far away from the star
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.960]   where there's enough material to form,
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.080]   and they migrated inwards.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.900]   And some of these planets migrating inwards
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.400]   due to interaction with other planets,
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.100]   or with the disk itself, they may have cleared it out.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.560]   Like, kicked other planets out of the system.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.440]   So there's a lot of ideas floating around.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.740]   We're not entirely sure.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.840]   - And what about Earth-like planets?
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.600]   Is that, that's another level of uncertainty that--
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.740]   - It's a level of uncertainty.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.480]   If we think of an Earth-like planet
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.100]   being an Earth around a sun in the same orbit,
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.480]   an Earth-like planet being an Earth-sized planet
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.700]   in an Earth-like orbit about a sun-like star,
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.540]   we're not there yet.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:58.360]   You know, we're not able to detect enough of those
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.640]   to give you a hard number.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.960]   Some people have extrapolated,
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:07.280]   and they will say as many as one in five stars like our sun
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.440]   could be hosting a true Earth-like planet.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.280]   - Wow.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.720]   On the topic of space exploration,
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.200]   there's been a lot of exciting developments with NASA,
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.440]   with SpaceX, with other companies
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:23.640]   successfully getting rockets into space with humans
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:27.840]   and getting them to land back, especially with SpaceX.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.000]   What are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.560]   Crew Dragon, working with NASA to launch astronauts?
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.680]   What's your sense about these exciting new developments?
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.360]   - Well, SpaceX and other so-called commercial companies
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.000]   are only good news for my field
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.160]   because they're lowering the cost of getting to space.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.200]   By having reusable rockets, it's just been, it's incredible,
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.800]   and we need cheaper access to space.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.600]   So from a very practical viewpoint, it's all good.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.120]   About getting people, there's this dream that we have
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.320]   to go to Mars, boots on Mars.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.840]   - Boots on Mars. (laughs)
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:04.880]   What do you think about that?
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   You mentioned probes.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.560]   What's the value of humans?
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.920]   Is that interesting to you
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.600]   from both a scientific and a human perspective?
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.440]   - Human mostly.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.960]   I think it's such in our desire to explore.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.280]   It's part of what it means to be human.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.800]   So wanting to go to another planet
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.320]   and be able to live there for some time,
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.440]   it's just what it means to be human.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.720]   You know, oftentimes in science and engineering,
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.560]   big, huge discoveries are made when we didn't intend to.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.080]   So often this kind of pure exploratory type of research
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.680]   or this pure exploration research,
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.200]   it can lead to something really important, like the laser.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.240]   We couldn't really live without that now.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.800]   At the grocery, you scan your foods.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.000]   There's surgery that involves lasers.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.200]   GPS, we all use our GPS.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.480]   We don't have GPS 'cause someone thought,
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.960]   "Hey, it would be great to have a navigation system."
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.640]   And so I do support, I do.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.760]   I just, but I really think it comes primarily
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.960]   just from the desire to explore.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.800]   - Do you think something, there's a lot of criticism
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.280]   and a lot of excitement about Mars.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:10.560]   Do you think there's value in trying to go to,
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.320]   put humans on Mars, first of all,
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.560]   and second of all, colonize Mars?
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.840]   Do you think there's something interesting
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.960]   that might come from there?
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.680]   - I'm convinced there will be something interesting.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:22.400]   I just don't know what it is yet.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.400]   But I don't think having some commercial value
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.440]   or value in the metric of something useful
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.400]   is really what's motivating us.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.560]   - So really, you see exploration is a long-term investment
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.080]   into something awesome that eventually
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.560]   will be commercial value.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.400]   - I do, actually.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.080]   - I do.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.160]   - So what about visiting?
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:45.320]   Okay, I apologize, but I mean, there's an exciting longing
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:50.320]   to visit Earth-like planets elsewhere.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.480]   So what's the closest Earth-like planet
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.800]   you think is worth visiting, and how hard is it?
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.520]   - Wow, it is very hard.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.020]   I mean, our nearest, call it Earth-mass planet,
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.240]   it's orbiting a star very different from our own sun,
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   an M-dwarf star, a small red star, Proxima Centauri.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.560]   It's over four light years away.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.200]   And we can't travel at the speed of light.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.880]   We can't even, I mean, it would take
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.520]   tens of thousands of years to get there
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.400]   with conventional methods.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.240]   So you know the movies like--
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.080]   - Multi-generationally.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.120]   - Multi-generationally.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.720]   Yeah, this movie, "Passenger," have you seen that movie?
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.560]   "Passenger."
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.400]   - No.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.640]   - It's about a big spaceship that is traveling
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.400]   to another planet, and everyone's hibernating.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.600]   I won't give you the spoiler alert,
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.760]   'cause one person wakes up, and then it's kind of a problem.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.160]   - Okay, got it.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.200]   - But yeah, the multi-generational ships,
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.840]   I mean, when you think about where we're headed
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.980]   as a species, maybe we don't send people.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:48.280]   Maybe we end up sending raw biological materials
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.640]   and instructions to print out humans.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.680]   It sounds kind of far-fetched, but already we're printing
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.200]   like liver cells in the lab and beating heart cells.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.420]   We're starting to reconstruct body parts.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.880]   I mean, the thing is, it is so hard to get to another planet
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.540]   that this thought of printing humans
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:09.120]   or printing life forms actually could be easier.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   - Yeah, that's somehow so sad to think of the idea
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.420]   that we would launch a successful spaceship
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.440]   that has multi-generational non-human life,
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.280]   and it's gonna reach other intelligent life,
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.840]   and by the time they figure out where it came from,
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.800]   human civilization would be extinct.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.600]   - Wow, yeah, that is really suffering.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.560]   - That's so, that's one.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.920]   There's a tempting thing to think about.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.320]   What are the possible trajectories?
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.320]   So, you know, Elon keeps talking about multi-planetary,
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:47.540]   us becoming multi-planetary species.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.900]   I mean, sure, Mars is a part of that,
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:54.900]   but the dream is to really expand outside the solar system,
[00:59:54.900 --> 01:00:00.340]   and it's not clear, just like as you said,
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.900]   what the actual scientific engineering steps
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.300]   that are required to take.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.340]   It seems like so daunting, so daunting.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:13.020]   So, the smart thing seems to be to do the most achievable,
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.380]   near daunting task, even if there doesn't seem
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.180]   to be a commercial application,
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.140]   which I think is colonizing Mars,
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.740]   but like from your perspective,
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:27.620]   is there some Manhattan project style,
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.620]   huge project in space that we might wanna take on?
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:36.700]   And you've had roles, you had scientist hat roles,
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.940]   and then you also had roles in terms of being
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:39.980]   on like committees and stuff,
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.900]   determining where funding goes and so on.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:46.780]   So, like, is there a huge, like multi-trillion,
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.580]   we've been throwing the T word around recently a lot,
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.100]   but these huge projects that we might wanna take on?
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.340]   - Well, first of all, we wanna find the planets
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.140]   like Earth first, like just even finding
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.580]   those Earth-like planets is a billion dollar endeavor,
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.040]   billions of dollars endeavor.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.160]   And that's so hard because an Earth is so small,
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.980]   so less massive, and so faint compared to our sun.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.600]   It's the proverbial needle in a haystack, but worse.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.320]   And we need very sophisticated space-based telescopes
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.780]   to be able to find these planets and to look at them
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.700]   and see which ones have water
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.380]   and which ones have signs of life on them.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.260]   - Yeah, the Starshade project that you're part of.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.100]   - Starshade.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.400]   - Starshade, yeah, it's probably the most
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.380]   bad-ass thing I've ever seen.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.220]   - Right.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.040]   (laughing)
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:28.880]   You know what's interesting?
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.720]   - Can you describe what it is first of all?
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.360]   - So, what's amazing about Starshade
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.780]   is it was first conceived of in the 1960s.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.280]   Imagine that, and revisited every decade until now
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.680]   when we think we can actually build it.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.720]   And Starshade is a giant specially-shaped screen.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.040]   It is about, there's different versions of it,
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.600]   but think about 30 meters in diameter.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.520]   - So, you're blocking out the sun.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.840]   - You're effectively blocking out the star.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.680]   - Yeah.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.860]   - So that you can see the planet directly.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.800]   And Starshade would have a spacecraft attached to it,
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.040]   and it would fly in space far away from Earth's gravity.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.520]   And it would have to formation fly with a space telescope.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.920]   So, the idea is that Starshade blocks out the starlight
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.960]   in a very careful way,
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.200]   and it has to block that starlight out
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.660]   so that the planet,
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.160]   that is 10 billion times fainter than the star,
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.120]   that only the planet light, goes to the telescope.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:23.360]   - Yeah, so in formation, meaning the telescope flies in,
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.560]   you gave a presentation on this,
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.880]   but it would fly in,
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.140]   this is extremely high-precision endeavor.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.460]   - Yeah, we had this analogy,
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.880]   like asking a friend to hold up a dime five miles away.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.720]   - Yeah.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.540]   - And you would see it directly,
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.960]   like at the perfect line of sight with you.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.800]   - Yeah.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.620]   (laughs)
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.720]   And the shape of it is pretty cool.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.480]   I mean, I don't know exactly what the physics of that,
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.240]   like what the optics are that require that shape.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.080]   - I can tell you.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.980]   It turns out that if you block out a star,
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.720]   imagine blocking out a star with a circularly
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.700]   or a square-shaped screen,
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.980]   you wouldn't actually be blocking it.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.800]   Because the star acts like a wave,
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.100]   the starlight can act like a wave,
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:03.480]   and it would actually bend around the edges of the screen.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.120]   And so instead of blocking out the light,
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.280]   you're expecting to see nothing,
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.360]   you would see ripples.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.120]   And the analogy that I love to give,
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.320]   it's like throwing a pebble in a pond.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.300]   You get those ripples,
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.220]   you get these concentric ripples and they go out,
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.540]   and light would do something quite similar.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.360]   You'd actually see ripples of light.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.520]   And those ripples of light,
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.880]   they're actually way brighter
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.280]   than the planet we'd be looking for.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.240]   (laughs)
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.080]   So we can't--
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.640]   - So they would introduce this noise that's--
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.480]   - Yeah, noise.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:30.640]   And so this star shade,
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.200]   it's like a mathematical solution
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.040]   to the problem of diffraction, it's called.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.440]   And this is what the first person
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.800]   who thought about star shade in the 1960s worked out,
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.960]   the mathematical shape,
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.760]   or one family of solutions.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.600]   And the idea is that when the star shade,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.360]   this very special shape like a giant flower,
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.460]   with petals, when it blocks out the light,
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.120]   the light bends around the edges,
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.400]   but interacts with itself
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.160]   in a way to give you a very, very dark image.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.120]   It would be like throwing a pebble in a pond.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.840]   And instead of getting ripples,
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.480]   the pond would be perfectly smooth,
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.480]   like incredibly smooth to one part in 10 billion.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.040]   And all the waves would be on the outer edges,
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.040]   far away from where you drop that pebble.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.880]   - And so this camera would be able to,
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.920]   oh, this camera, this telescope would be able to
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.800]   get some signal from the planet then.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.920]   - Yes, and it would be hard 'cause the planet is so faint.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.280]   But with the star out of the way,
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.680]   the glare of that bright, bright, bright star,
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.280]   with that out of the way,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.440]   then it becomes a much more manageable task.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.360]   - So how do we get that thing out there?
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.120]   We're still working with unlimited money.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.680]   - Okay, we're working with unlimited money.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.160]   We have some more engineering problems to solve,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.040]   but not too many more.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.400]   We've been burning down our so-called tall pole list.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.680]   - What kind of list?
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.240]   - We call it technology tall pole.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.760]   It's the phrase where you have to figure out
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.360]   what are your hardest problems,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.960]   and then break those down to solve.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.600]   So the star shade, one of the really hard problems
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.680]   was how to formation fly at tens of thousands of kilometers.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.960]   It's like, wow, that is insane.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.720]   And the team broke that down, actually,
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.440]   into a sensing problem.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.640]   Because of the star shade,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.040]   how do you see the star shade precisely enough
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.400]   to control it?
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.640]   'Cause if you're shining a flashlight,
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.640]   you know the beam spreads out.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.160]   So if the star shade has a beacon, an LED or a laser,
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.880]   it's gonna spread out so much
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.880]   by the time it gets to the telescope.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.920]   The problem wasn't how do you tell the star shade
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.520]   how to move around fast enough to stay in a straight line.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.640]   The problem was how are you able to sense it well enough?
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.760]   So problems like that were broken down,
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.640]   and money that came from NASA to solve problems
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.360]   is put towards solving it.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.840]   So we've got through most of the hard problems right now.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.280]   Another one was that star shade,
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.920]   even though it's looking at a star,
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.720]   light from our own sun could hit the edges of the star shade
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.440]   and bounce off into the telescope, believe it or not.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.560]   And that would actually ruin it,
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.880]   because we're trying to see this tiny, tiny signal.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.520]   So then the question is, how do you make a razor-thin edge?
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.480]   Like those petal edges would have to be like a razor.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.560]   And what materials can you use?
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.600]   So there's a series of problems like that.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.800]   - Wow, so there's a materials problem in there?
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.480]   - Some of them, mm-hmm, materials problem.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.320]   And there's one.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.160]   So we almost finished solving all those problems,
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.880]   and then it's just a matter of building one
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.340]   and testing it in a full-scale size facility.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.040]   And then building the telescope,
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.840]   it's just a matter of time to build everything
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.120]   and get it up for launch.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.720]   - So this is an engineering--
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.560]   - Close, engineering, yeah, it's close.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.440]   - This is an engineering project.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.280]   - It's a real engineering project, mm-hmm.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.120]   - I actually can tell you about two other projects
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.000]   that are not mine.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.100]   I like to call Starshade mine,
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:38.920]   because it was my project that I helped make it mainstream,
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.720]   where that line is constantly shifting.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.640]   When I started, when I got this leadership role
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.480]   on Starshade, I remember telling people about it,
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.800]   and it was definitely not on the mainstream okay line.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.560]   It was on the giggle factor side of the line.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.640]   - The giggle factor.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.320]   - And people would just laugh, like, that's dead.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.240]   Like, you can never formation fly.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.680]   Or they'd say, why are you working on that?
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.360]   That's just so not, it's not possible.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.200]   - That's so awesome.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.320]   There's a few things you've done in your life,
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.120]   and that's when I first saw Starshade,
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.400]   I was like, what, really?
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.080]   And then, like, it sinks in.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.880]   I mean, it's the same thing I felt with, like, Elon Musk,
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.340]   or certain people who do crazy stuff.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:16.280]   And then, and they actually make it work.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.280]   I mean, if you get Starshade information flying together,
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.560]   I mean, how awesome is that,
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.660]   if you actually make that happen?
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.200]   Even, like, from a, sorry, from the robotics perspective,
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.800]   even if it doesn't give us good data,
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.240]   that's just, like, a cool thing to get out there.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.440]   I mean, it's really exciting.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.520]   - Really cool.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.280]   So there's two other topics that aren't mine,
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.180]   but I still love them.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.240]   One of them, let's just talk about it briefly,
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.080]   'cause it's not a probe,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.240]   but it's the idea to send a telescope very far away,
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.720]   to 500 times the Earth-Sun distance.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.960]   And this is way farther than the Voyager spacecrafts
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.880]   are right now.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.840]   And to use our sun as a gravitational lens,
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.440]   to use our sun to magnify something that's behind it.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.320]   It's gotta sink in for a minute.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.840]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.080]   I mean, I don't know what the physics of that is,
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.320]   like, how to use the sun.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.520]   - In astronomy, and Einstein thought about this initially,
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.000]   we can use massive objects, bend space.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.240]   And so light that should be traveling, like, straight,
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.280]   it actually travels around the warped space.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.360]   - And somehow, you figure out a way
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.840]   to use that for magnification.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.080]   - You have a way to use that for magnification,
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:25.920]   that's right.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.160]   There are galaxies that are lensed,
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.320]   so-called gravitational lens,
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.600]   by intervening galaxy clusters, actually.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.240]   And there are microlensing events,
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.140]   where stars get magnified,
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.000]   as an unseen gravitational lens star
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.480]   passes in between us and that very distant star.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:45.980]   It's actually a real tool in astronomy.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.200]   Yeah, using gravitational lensing to magnify,
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.880]   because it bends more rays towards you
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.960]   than you'd normally see.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.360]   - And again, we're trying to get more higher resolution
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.000]   images that are basically boiled down to light.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.600]   - Well, it boils down to light, exactly.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.680]   - And then you can maybe get more information about.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.640]   - Well, in this case, you would ask me,
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:10.380]   let's say, if this thing could get built,
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.440]   it would take something, like,
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.240]   they like to say 25 years to get from here to there,
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.680]   25 years, and then it could send
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.080]   some information back to us.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.480]   And then you'd say, "So, Sarah, how many pixels?"
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.860]   And I wouldn't say one or less than one,
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.080]   I'd say, you know, it could be like 10 by 10 pixels.
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.400]   Could be 100 pixels, which would be awesome.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.960]   - I mean, it's still crazy that we can get
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.680]   a lot of information from that.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.800]   - Crazy, right, and it's crazy for a lot of other reasons,
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.600]   because again, you have to line up the sun and your target.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.000]   You'd only have one telescope per target,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.800]   'cause every star is behind the sun in a different way.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.960]   So, it's a lot of complicated things.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.920]   - Well, what about the second?
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.520]   - The second one, it's called Starshot.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.600]   You know, Starshot means, like, big dreams.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.320]   And it's an initiative by the Breakthrough Foundation.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.640]   And Starshot is the concept to send thousands
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.840]   of little tiny spacecraft, which they now call Starchip.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.480]   So, instead of Starship, it's Starchip.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.520]   And there's a little chip, and the Starchip,
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.140]   so, like thousands of little turtles being born,
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.720]   they're not all gonna make it.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.480]   There's used to send lots of them.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.680]   And each of these Starchips, once they're launched
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.000]   into, I guess, low Earth orbit,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.600]   they will deploy a solar sail
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.600]   that's a few meters in diameter.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.420]   And the idea is that on Earth, we would have a bank of,
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.880]   this one is still a bit on the other side of the line,
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.880]   but we'd have a bank of telescopes with lasers.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.720]   They'd be like a gigawatt power.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.160]   And these lasers would momentarily shine upwards
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.260]   and accelerate, they'd hit these sails.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.760]   They'd be like a power source for the sail.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.440]   And would accelerate the sails to travel
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.200]   at about a 20th the speed of light.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.760]   - Is that as crazy as it sounds?
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.000]   - Well, like any good engineering project,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.600]   it has to be broken down into the crazy parts.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.320]   And the Breakthrough Initiative, to their huge credit,
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.640]   is sponsoring getting over these,
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.840]   actually, initially, they listed 19 challenges.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.800]   This is broken down into concrete things.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.680]   Like one of them is, well, you have to buy the land
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.320]   and make sure the airspace is okay
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.760]   with you sending up that much power overhead.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.000]   Another one is, you have to have material on the sail
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.080]   where the lasers won't just vaporize it.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.440]   So there's a lot of issues.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.880]   But anyway, these sails would be accelerated
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.400]   to 20th the speed of light.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.000]   And their journey to the nearest star
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.900]   would no longer be tens of thousands of years,
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.480]   but could be 20 years.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.600]   Okay, 20, so it's not as bad as tens of thousands.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.600]   And these thousands or however many make it,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.200]   they'll go by the nearest star system
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.560]   and snap some images and radio the information back to Earth
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.440]   because they're traveling so fast they can't slow down.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.160]   But they'll zoom by, take some photos, send it back.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.000]   - I res.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.960]   - Yeah, but see, just what I want you to pause on
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.600]   for a second is that just by making that a real concept,
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.120]   and the money given won't make it happen,
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.720]   but what it's done is it's planted the seed.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.680]   And it's shifted that line from what is crazy
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.880]   to what is a real project.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.120]   It's shifted it just ever so slightly enough, I think,
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.640]   to plant the seed that we have to find a way
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.240]   to somehow find a way to get there.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:26.240]   - That is, again, to stay on that, that is so powerful.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.280]   Take a big crazy idea and break it down
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:34.440]   into smaller crazy ideas, order it in a list,
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.180]   and knock it out one at a time.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:41.960]   I don't know, I've never heard anything more inspiring
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.640]   from an engineering perspective
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.000]   'cause that's how you solve the impossible things.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   So you open your new book discussing rogue planet,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.360]   PSO J318, I never said this out loud, .522.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.600]   So a rogue planet, which is just this poetic,
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.600]   beautiful vision of a planet that, as you write,
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.320]   lurches across the galaxy like a rudderless ship
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.840]   wrapped in perpetual darkness.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.880]   Its surface swept by constant storms,
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.360]   its black skies raining molten iron.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.360]   Just like the vision of that, the scary, the darkness,
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.900]   just how not pleasant it is for human life,
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.500]   just the intensity of that metaphor, I don't know.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.640]   And the reason you use that is to paint
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.400]   a feeling of loneliness, I think.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.240]   - And despair.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.440]   - And despair.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   And why, maybe on the planet side,
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.200]   why does it feel, maybe it's just me,
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.120]   why does it feel so profoundly lonely
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.600]   on that kind of planet?
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:04.220]   - I think it's because we all wanna be a part of something,
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.200]   a part of a family or a part of a community
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.440]   or a part of something.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.680]   And so our solar system, and by the way,
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:17.040]   I only, it's sort of like when you treat yourself
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.080]   to eating an entire tub of ice cream.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.960]   Like I sometimes treat myself to imagine things like this
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.040]   and not just be so cut and dried.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.520]   But when you imagine that, this planet's not,
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.120]   'cause I don't wanna give emotions to a planet per se,
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.360]   but the planet's not part of anything.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.120]   It's somehow, it's just all on its own,
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.400]   just kind of out there without that warm energy
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.060]   from its sun, it's just all alone out there.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.380]   To me, it was this little discovery
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.260]   that I actually feel pretty good
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.540]   being part of this solar system.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.780]   It felt like we have a sun, we have like a little family.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:54.820]   And it felt like it sucked for the rogue planet
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:59.820]   to just floating about, not floating, flying rudderless.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.620]   By the way, how many rogue planets are there in your sun?
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.580]   - We don't know totally.
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.460]   I mean, there's some rogue planets
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.540]   that are just born on their own.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.660]   I know that sounds really weird
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:13.580]   to be how can you be born an orphan, but they just are.
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:16.940]   Because most planets are born out of a disc of gas
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.060]   and dust around a star.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.500]   But some of these small planets are like totally failed stars
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.460]   they're so failed, they're just small planets on their own.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:27.260]   But we think that there's probably honestly,
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.860]   there's another path to a rogue planet.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:31.260]   That's one that's been kicked out of its star system
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.700]   by other planets, like a game of billiard balls.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.500]   Something just gets kicked out.
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.140]   We actually think there's probably
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.820]   as many rogue planets as stars.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:44.500]   - No flying out there, fundamentally alone.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:49.500]   So the book is a memoir, is about your life.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:55.060]   And it weaves both your fascination
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:59.100]   with planets outside the solar system
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:02.420]   and the path of your life.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.860]   And you lost your husband,
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.340]   which is a kind of central part of the book
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:15.540]   that created a feeling of the rogue planet.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.380]   By the way, what's the name of the book?
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.660]   - The name of the book is
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.340]   "The Smallest Lights in the Universe."
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.620]   - What's up with the title?
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.460]   What's the meaning?
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.060]   - Well, the title has a double meaning.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.580]   On the face of it, it's the search for other earths.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.380]   Earths are so dim compared to the big,
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.580]   bright massive star beside them.
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.540]   Searching for the earths is like searching
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.900]   for the smallest lights in the universe.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:42.340]   It has this other meaning too.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.900]   I really hope that you or the other people listening
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.700]   never get to the place where you're just,
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.220]   you've fallen off the cliff
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:55.060]   into this horrible place of huge despair.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.020]   And once in a while you get a glimmer of a better life,
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.060]   of some kind of hope.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.700]   And those are also the smallest lights in the universe.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.380]   - Well, maybe we can tell the full story
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:11.500]   before we talk about the glimmer of hope.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.460]   What did it feel like to first find out
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.940]   that your husband, Mike, was sick?
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.900]   - It was incredibly frustrating.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:23.100]   Like lots of us have had some kind of problem
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.980]   that the doctors completely ignore.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:27.260]   And so they kept blowing him off.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.820]   It's nothing.
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.900]   Are they paid to just say it's nothing?
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.380]   I mean, it's just insane.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.460]   I was just so angry.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.980]   And we finally got to a point where he was really sick.
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.580]   He was like in bed, not able to move basically.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.140]   And it turned out all the things they ignored
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.340]   and not done any tests,
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:49.340]   he had like a 100% blockage in his intestine, like 100%.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.540]   Like nothing could get out, nothing could get in.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.380]   And it was pretty, pretty shocking
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.500]   to even hear then that it could be nothing.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.260]   - What was the progression of it
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:03.180]   in the context of maybe the medical system, the doctors?
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.260]   I mean, what did it feel like?
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.220]   Did you feel like a human being?
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:11.100]   - I felt like a child.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.620]   Like the doctors were trying to
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:17.020]   water down the real diagnosis
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.940]   or treat us like we couldn't know the truth
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.980]   or they didn't know.
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.100]   You know, I felt mixed.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.940]   Like it's not a good situation
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:25.660]   if you think the doctor either has no idea
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.100]   what he or she is doing
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.960]   or if the doctor's purposely,
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.940]   let's just say lying to you to sugarcoat it.
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.300]   Like I didn't know which one of it was,
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.220]   but I knew it was one of those.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.940]   - What were the things he was suffering from?
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:39.860]   - Well, initially he just had a random stomachache.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.180]   I hate to say that out loud
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.540]   because I know a lot of people
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.580]   will have a random stomachache.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:46.140]   But so he just had a bad stomachache
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.740]   and then, hmm, this is weird.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.260]   A few days later, another bad stomachache,
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.260]   it kind of gets worse,
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.820]   might go away for a few weeks, might come back.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.900]   And at the time, all I knew was my dad
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.580]   had had that same thing.
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.980]   Not the same identical system,
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.460]   but he had these really weird pains
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:03.500]   and he ended up having the worst diagnosis.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.240]   One of the worst diagnoses you can get
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.980]   from a random stomachache is pancreatic cancer.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.900]   Because the time, the pancreas,
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.860]   like you can't feel anything,
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.220]   so by the time you feel pain,
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.220]   it's too late, it's spread already.
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.980]   So I was just like, beside myself,
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.300]   I'm like, this is like, wow,
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.860]   this guy, he's got a random stomachache.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:21.340]   All I know is another man I loved
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.980]   had a random stomachache and it didn't end well.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.620]   - How did you deal with it
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:28.660]   emotionally, psychologically, intellectually,
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.260]   as a scientist?
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:31.540]   What was that like?
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.500]   That whole, 'cause it's not immediate,
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.180]   it's a long journey.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.340]   - It's a long journey and you don't know
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.820]   where the diagnosis is going.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.820]   So anyone who's suffered from a major illness,
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.940]   there's like always branches in the road.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:47.660]   So, you know, he had this intestinal blockage.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.140]   I can't imagine someone in their 40s
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.460]   having that and that be normal.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.460]   But the doctor's like, it could be nothing,
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.440]   could just cut it out.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.660]   You don't need most of your intestine,
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.220]   it's a repeating pattern, just cut that out,
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:58.060]   it could be fine.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.980]   But it ended up not being fine
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.900]   and he was diagnosed as being terminally ill.
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.820]   Well, it really changed my life in a huge way.
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:07.460]   First of all, I remember immediately one summer,
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.140]   the summer when this happened,
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:11.820]   I started asking everyone I knew, I would ask you,
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.620]   I don't know if it's my job to put you on the spot,
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.200]   I'd say, you have one year to live, or two or three.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:21.300]   What will you do differently about your life now?
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.860]   Lex, you have one year to live, what would you do?
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.160]   - I mean, it's hard.
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.520]   I don't know if you wanna answer that.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.440]   - No, no, no, I think about it a lot.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.520]   I mean, that's a really good thing to meditate on.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.520]   We can talk about maybe how, why you bring that up,
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.160]   if it is or not a heavy question.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.000]   - It's very heavy.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.440]   - But I get, I think about mortality a lot
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:51.440]   and for me, it feels like a really good way
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.700]   to focus in on is what you're doing today,
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.480]   the people you have around you, the family you have,
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:03.780]   does it bring you joy?
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.880]   Does it bring you fulfillment?
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:12.020]   And basically, for me, long ago,
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:18.420]   tried to be ready to die any day.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:23.720]   So today, I kind of woke up looking for,
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.480]   I was nervous about talking to you.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.980]   I really admire your work and the book is very good
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.580]   and it's super exciting topic.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:36.020]   But then there's this also feeling like,
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.020]   if this is the last conversation I have in my life,
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:43.100]   if I die today, will this be the right,
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.820]   like am I glad today happened?
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:48.560]   And it is, and I am glad today happened.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.400]   So that's the way--
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.540]   - And that's so unique,
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.740]   I never got that answer from a single person.
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:58.540]   - The busyness of life, there's goals, there's dreams,
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.220]   there's like planning, plans.
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.740]   - Very few people make it happen.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.140]   That's what I learned.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:05.620]   And so a lot of these people--
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.300]   - Oh, like you run out of time.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.180]   - It's not so much you run out of time,
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.540]   but I'd come back later and be like,
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:11.220]   okay, why don't you do that?
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.860]   If that's what you would do,
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:13.940]   if you're gonna die a year from now,
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:15.380]   why don't you make it real?
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:19.040]   Simple things, spend more time with family.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.120]   Like why don't you do that?
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.680]   And no one had an answer, it turns out,
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.400]   unless you usually, unless you have,
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.560]   you really do have a pressing end of life,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.880]   people don't do their bucket list
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.240]   or try to change their career.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.840]   And some people can't, so we can't,
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:32.720]   like for a lot of people,
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.800]   they can't do anything about it and that's fine.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:38.000]   But the ones who can take action for some reason never do.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.920]   And that was one of the ways that Mike's death,
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.720]   or at the time his impending death,
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.840]   really, really affected me.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.340]   'Cause you know, for these sick people,
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:48.780]   what I learned, he had a bucket list
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.260]   and he was able to do some of the bucket list.
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.780]   It was awesome.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.260]   But he got sick pretty quickly.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.820]   So if you do only have a year to live,
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:59.340]   it's ironic 'cause you can't do the things you wanted to do
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.260]   because you get too sick too fast.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.380]   - What were the bucket list things for you
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:06.380]   that you realized like, what am I doing with my life?
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.940]   - That was the major concept.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.740]   Of him, after he died, I didn't know.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.140]   Like I was just lost.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.020]   Because when something that profound happens,
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.180]   all the things I was doing,
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.900]   most of the things I was doing were just meaningless.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.900]   Was so tough to find an answer for that.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.220]   And that's when I settled on,
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.940]   I'm gonna devote the rest of my life
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.180]   to trying to find another earth
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:35.180]   and to find out, to find that we're not alone.
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:40.340]   - What is that longing for connection with others?
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:43.500]   What's that about?
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.500]   What do you think, why is that so full of meaning?
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:46.340]   - I don't know why.
[01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:48.220]   I mean, I think it's how we're hardwired.
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.220]   Like one of my friends some time ago,
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.260]   actually when my dad died,
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:54.780]   he never heard someone say this before,
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.140]   but he's like, Sarah, you know,
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:01.740]   why are we evolved to take death so harshly?
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:03.240]   Like what kind of society would we be
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.660]   if we just didn't care people died?
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.220]   That would be a very different type of world.
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.780]   How would we as a species have got to where we are?
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.600]   So I think that is tied hand in hand
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.000]   with why do we seek connection?
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.180]   It's just that what we were talking about before,
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.800]   that subconsciousness that we don't understand.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:24.460]   - Yeah, coupled, you know, the other side,
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.740]   the flip side of the coin of connection and love
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.860]   is a fear of loss.
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:33.660]   It's like that was, again, I don't know.
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.300]   It's what makes you appreciate the moment
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.180]   is that the thing ends.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.980]   - Yeah, that's definitely a hard one.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:42.860]   - The thing ends, but, and it's hard to not,
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.900]   you wouldn't want to limit, like it's,
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:49.120]   like my dog who I love so much, I'll start to cry.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.420]   Like I can't think about the end.
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.620]   I know he'll age much faster than I will,
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.040]   and someday it will end, right?
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.900]   But it's too sad to think of.
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.700]   But should I not have got a dog?
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:58.540]   - Right.
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.680]   - Should I have not brought this sort of joy into my life
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.180]   because I know it won't be forever?
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.420]   It's-
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.860]   - Well, there's a philosopher, Ernest Becker,
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.980]   who wrote a book, "Denial of Death."
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:12.940]   I just, and "Warm of the Cores" is another book,
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.100]   talks about terror management theory.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.740]   Sheldon Solomon, I just talked to him a few weeks ago.
[01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:21.540]   He's a brilliant philosopher, psychologist,
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.900]   that their theory, whatever you make of it,
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:29.900]   is that the fear of death is at the core of everything,
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.920]   everything we do.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.540]   So like you're, that you think you don't think
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:40.020]   about the mortality of your dog, but you do.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.180]   And that's what makes the experience rich.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:45.380]   Like there's this kind of, like in the shadows
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:50.380]   lurks the knowledge that this won't last forever.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:55.380]   And that makes every moment just special
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:57.180]   in some kind of a weird way
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:00.460]   that the moments are special for us humans.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:07.200]   - I mean, sorry to use romantic terms like love,
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.880]   but what do you make, what did you learn about love
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.940]   from losing it, from losing your husband?
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:21.080]   - Well, I learned to love the things I have more.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.200]   I learned to love the people that I have more
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.420]   and to not let the little things bother me as much.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.560]   - What about the rediscovery or like the discovery
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:41.440]   of the little lights in the darkness?
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:46.440]   So the book, I think you've brilliantly described
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:50.860]   the dark parts of your journey,
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:57.160]   but maybe can you talk about how you were able
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.860]   to rediscover the lights?
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.200]   - They came in many ways.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.020]   And the way like to think about it is like grief is an ocean.
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:09.960]   It was tiny islands of the little,
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.800]   like the little lights and eventually that ocean
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:14.480]   gets smaller and smaller and the islands
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.160]   like become continents with lakes.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.600]   So initially it'd be like the children laughing one day
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.920]   or my colleagues at work who rallied around me
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.640]   and would take me away from my darkness
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.800]   to work on a project.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.840]   Later on, it turned out to be a group of women my age,
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.220]   all widows, all with children in my town.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.120]   And it would be, even though it was a bit morose
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.980]   getting together, still very joyful at the same time.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:47.080]   - What was the journey of rediscovering love like for you?
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.960]   So refinding, I mean, is there some, by way of advice
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   or insight about how to rediscover the light?
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.240]   How to rediscover the beauty of life?
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.400]   - Of life, it's a hard one.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.000]   I think you just have to stay open to being positive
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.300]   and just to get out there.
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:13.720]   - Do you still think about your own mortality?
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.320]   So you mentioned that that was a thing
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.600]   that you would meditate on as a question
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.320]   when it was right there in front of you,
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.040]   but do you still think about it?
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.940]   - I think I will after talking to you.
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:26.880]   (laughing)
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.680]   No, it's not really something I think about.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.320]   I mean, I do think about the search for another earth
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.520]   and will I get there?
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.520]   Will I be able to conclude my search and is there one?
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.680]   I guess time goes by, that window to solve that problem
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.580]   gets smaller.
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:49.240]   - What would bring you, again, I apologize if this
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.080]   makes concrete the fact that life is finite,
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.680]   but what would bring you joy if we discovered
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.200]   while you're still here?
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.080]   - What would bring me joy?
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.220]   Finding another earth, an earth like planet
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.080]   around a sun like star, knowing that there's at least one
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.680]   or more out there, being able to see water,
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.120]   that it has signs of water and being able to see some gases
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.340]   that don't belong.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:16.200]   So I know that the search will continue after I'm gone,
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.000]   enough to fuel the next generation.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.080]   - So just like opening the door
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.980]   and there's like this glimmer of hope.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.800]   What do you think it will take to realize that?
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.920]   I mean, we've talked about all these interesting projects,
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.320]   Starshade especially, but is there something
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.360]   that you're particularly kind of hopeful about
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:37.440]   in the next 10, 20 years that might give us
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.520]   that exact glimmer of hope
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.800]   that there's earth like planets out there?
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.240]   - I have to, I stand behind Starshade in all cases.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.320]   But there is this other kind of field
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.100]   that everyone is involved in because Starshade is hard.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:53.960]   Earths are hard.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.960]   But there's another category of planet star type
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.800]   that's easier.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.000]   And these are planets orbiting small red dwarf stars.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:03.960]   They're not earth like at all.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.560]   Think like earth cousin instead of earth twin.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.140]   But there's a chance that we might establish
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.300]   that some of those have water and signs of life on them.
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:12.760]   That's nearer term than Starshade
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:15.400]   and we're all working hard on that too.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.180]   - Let me ask by way of recommendations,
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.720]   I think a lot of people are curious
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.960]   about this kind of stuff.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.120]   What three books, technical or fiction
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.640]   or philosophical or anything really
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:28.880]   had an impact on your life
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.880]   and or you would recommend besides of course your book?
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.680]   - There's one book I wish everyone could read.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.660]   I'm not sure if you've read it.
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:42.160]   It's actually a children's book, like a young adult book.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.540]   It's called "The Giver."
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.280]   - Yes.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:48.520]   - And it is the book that kids in school read now.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.640]   And I only--
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.940]   - Sorry.
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.580]   That's wow.
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:53.660]   'Cause I forgot.
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:54.480]   (laughs)
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.380]   Sorry, that caught me off guard.
[01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:59.460]   So when I first came to this country, I didn't speak much.
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.120]   It's really what made me,
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.100]   it had a profound impact on my life.
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:04.940]   - Wow.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.020]   - And at a really important moment
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.580]   'cause they give it to kids.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.420]   Like I think--
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.260]   - It's like middle school I think or maybe elementary.
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.620]   - Eighth grade, yeah, something like that.
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.460]   - Well, I'm so surprised you've even heard of this book.
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:13.740]   - Yeah, so they give it.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:16.060]   But like it's the value of giving the right book
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.660]   to a person at the right time.
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:18.500]   - Wow.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:22.180]   - 'Cause it's very accessible.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.980]   - Do we wanna share what the story is without spoiling it?
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.020]   - Yeah, you can without spoiling, right?
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:32.060]   - Well, it follows this boy in this very utopic society
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:32.900]   that's like perfect.
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:35.540]   It's been all clean cut and made perfect actually.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:37.660]   And as he kind of comes of age,
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.260]   he starts realizing something's wrong with his world.
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:42.540]   And so it's part of that question,
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.700]   are we gonna evolve as he,
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:44.540]   I mean, this isn't what's there,
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.620]   but it made me wonder,
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.540]   are we evolving to a better place?
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:50.500]   Is there a day when we can eliminate poverty and hunger
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.020]   and crime and sickness?
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:54.300]   In this book, they pretty much have
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.260]   in a society that the boy's in.
[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.140]   And it sort of follows him.
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.740]   And he becomes a chosen one to be like a receiver,
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:03.140]   the giver's the old wise man
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:06.580]   who retains some of the harshness of the outside world
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:08.460]   so that he can advise the people.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:09.820]   And as this sort of boy comes of age
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.220]   and is chosen for this special role,
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:13.740]   he finds the world isn't what he expects.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.580]   And I don't know about you,
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:15.940]   but it was so profound for me
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.220]   because it jolts you out of reality.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.980]   It's like, oh my God, what am I doing here?
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.740]   I'm just going with the flow with my society.
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:24.420]   How do I think outside the box
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.820]   and the confines of my society,
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.460]   which surely carries negative things with it
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.460]   that we don't realize today.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.300]   - Yeah, and also in the flip side of that is
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:36.140]   if you do take a step outside the box on occasion,
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:39.180]   what's the psychological burden of that?
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:42.260]   Like, is that a step you wanna take?
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.780]   Is that a journey you wanna take?
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:46.100]   What is that life like?
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:46.940]   - I don't know.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:48.180]   I felt like from the book, you have to take it.
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:49.820]   I found from the book.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.660]   I never thought, like, now that you're saying it,
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:52.780]   I see what you're saying.
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.340]   The burden is huge, but I always felt like the answer is yes.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:58.220]   You absolutely want to know what's outside,
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:32:59.580]   but you can't do that if you're very,
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.260]   it's hard to be objective about your own reality.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:04.180]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a very human instinct,
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:08.500]   but it also, the book kind of shows that
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.780]   it has an effect on you.
[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:13.140]   And it's a really interesting question
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.140]   about our society and taking a step out.
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:20.180]   It's by Lois Lowry, I think is how you pronounce it.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.860]   I really do hope everyone can read it.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.020]   And it is a young adult book, but it's still,
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:25.340]   it's incredibly, I'm really glad.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:27.660]   I only read it 'cause my kids got it for school.
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:28.620]   I just thought, okay, well,
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:29.740]   why don't I just see what this is about?
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.220]   And I just, wow.
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:35.180]   - Yeah, yeah, I think it's also the value of education.
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.140]   I think, I'm surprised you mentioned it.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:38.940]   I've never really mentioned to anybody.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.340]   I'm sure a lot of people had similar experience like me
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.180]   and maybe--
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.180]   - It's a generational thing, though,
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.220]   because the book came out, I think, in the '90s.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.940]   So if you're older than like me,
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.860]   that book didn't exist when we were in middle school.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:53.620]   So I just do think a lot of people won't have heard of it.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.940]   - But it's an interesting question of those books.
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.940]   I mean, I'm reminded often,
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.300]   I suppose the same is true with other subjects,
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.380]   but books are special.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:08.580]   At early age, middle school, maybe early high school,
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:11.660]   those can change the direction of your life.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:15.300]   And also certainly teachers,
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.820]   they can change completely the direction of your life.
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.940]   There's so many stories about teachers of mathematics,
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:24.740]   teachers of physics, of any kind of subjects,
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.420]   basically changing the direction of a human's life.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:32.420]   That's like, not to get into the whole,
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.140]   almost like a political thing,
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.820]   but we undervalue teachers.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.460]   It's a special position that they hold.
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:43.780]   - That's so true, yeah.
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:46.580]   Well, I do have two other books, or two other things.
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.900]   One is something I came across just a few days ago, actually.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.380]   It's actually a film called "Picture a Scientist."
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.900]   And when you picture a scientist,
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:58.940]   you probably don't picture the women
[01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:01.020]   and women of color in this film.
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:03.900]   And it is a way to get outside your box.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:06.820]   I really think everyone interested in science,
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.660]   even just peripherally, should watch this,
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:12.460]   because it is shocking and sobering at the same time.
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.540]   And it talks about how,
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:17.380]   well, I think one of the messages across is,
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.340]   we really are, like,
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.380]   I don't know if we're hardwired
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.380]   to just like people like ourselves,
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.660]   but we're excluding a lot of people,
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:25.980]   and therefore a lot of great ideas,
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.540]   by not being able to think outside
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.580]   of how we're all stereotyping each other.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:32.740]   So it's hard to kind of convey that.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.700]   And you can just say, "Oh yeah, I wanna be more diverse.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   I wanna be more open."
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.460]   But it's a nearly impossible problem to solve.
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:42.260]   And the movie really helps open people's eyes to it.
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:45.540]   This book I put third, because unlike "The Giver,"
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:46.620]   people may not wanna read it.
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:47.540]   It's not as relevant.
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:50.340]   But when I was in my early 20s,
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:51.860]   I went to this big,
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.580]   this like 800-people large conference
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:58.220]   run by the Wilderness Canoe Association
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:00.180]   in my hometown of Toronto.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:03.140]   And there was a family friend there who I met.
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:05.860]   And he said, "Read this book. It'll change your life."
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.060]   And it actually changed my life.
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.740]   And it was a book called "Sleeping Island"
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.300]   by an author, P.G. Downs,
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.620]   who just coincidentally lived in this area,
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:15.940]   lived in the Boston area.
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:18.100]   And he was a teacher, I think at a private school.
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:20.820]   And every summer he would go to Canada
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:23.340]   with a canoe, often by himself.
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:25.900]   And he wrote this book, maybe in the 40s or 50s,
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.940]   about a trip he took in the late 1930s.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:31.220]   And I was just shocked that even at that time,
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.500]   although that was a long time ago,
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.620]   there were large parts of Canada
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.420]   that were untouched by white people.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:40.340]   And he went up there and interacted with the natives.
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:44.660]   He called the book, it had a subtitle that was called,
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.300]   it was something like "Journey in the Barren Lands."
[01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.820]   And when you go up north in Canada, you pass the tree line.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.340]   Just like on a mountain, if you hike up a mountain,
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.420]   you get so far north there aren't any trees.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.260]   And he wrote eloquently about the land
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.500]   and about being out there.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.380]   There weren't even any maps of the region in that time.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:02.620]   And I just thought to myself, wow,
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:04.060]   that you could just take the summer off
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:07.340]   and explore by canoe and go and see what's out there.
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:10.540]   And it led to me just doing that, that very thing.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:12.180]   Of course, it's different now,
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.260]   but going out to where the road ends
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.900]   and putting the canoe in the water and just,
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:16.740]   well, we had to have a plan.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:19.260]   We didn't just explore, but go down this river,
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:22.460]   rivers with rapids and travel over lakes and portages
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.620]   and just really live.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:27.420]   - So just really explore, screw it.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.380]   That doesn't, like it doesn't.
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:30.700]   - Or just use from a topo map,
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:33.140]   from a topographical map from the library.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:33.980]   - That's scary.
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:37.700]   - There were scary elements about it, out of it,
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:42.060]   but part of the excitement or the joy or the desire
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.340]   was to be scared.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:45.860]   Like it was to go out there and have, live on the edge.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.220]   - And persevere, yeah.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:48.320]   - And persevere, yeah.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.780]   - Do you have advice that you would give
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:56.780]   to a young person today that would like to help you
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.860]   maybe on the planetary science side,
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.900]   discover exoplanets or maybe bigger picture,
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.620]   just succeed in life?
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:06.220]   - I do have some advice just to succeed.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:07.860]   It's tough advice in a way,
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:11.020]   but it is to find something that you love doing
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.660]   that you're also very good at.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:15.980]   And in some ways the stars have to align
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:17.780]   because you've got to find that thing you're good at
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.580]   or the range of things.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:21.260]   And it actually has to overlap with something
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.220]   that actually you love doing every day.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.000]   So it's not a tedious job.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.380]   That's the best way to succeed.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:31.180]   - What were the signals that in your own life
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.020]   were there to make you realize you're good at something?
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:37.660]   You're like, what were you good at
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.220]   that made you pursue a PhD
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:44.160]   and it made you pursue the search?
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.900]   - I mean, that was the one sentence version.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.740]   In my case, it was a long slog
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:51.140]   and there were a lot of things I wasn't good at initially.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.460]   But so initially, I was good at high school math.
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.220]   I was good at high school science.
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:56.780]   I loved astronomy.
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:58.460]   And I realized those could all fit together.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.600]   Like the day I realized you could be an astronomer
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.140]   for a job, it has to be one of my top days of my life.
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:06.700]   I didn't know that you could be that for a job.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.260]   And I was good at all those things.
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.580]   And although my dad wanted me to do something more practical
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.100]   where he could be guaranteed I could support myself
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:14.740]   was another option.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.740]   But initially I wasn't that good at physics.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:18.980]   It was a slog to just get through school and grad school.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.940]   It was a very, very long time.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.760]   But ultimately when faced with a choice
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.840]   and I had the luxury of choosing,
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.740]   knowing that I was good at something and also loved it,
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:29.580]   it really carried me through.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:32.520]   - Now I asked some of the smartest people in the world
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:34.320]   the most ridiculous question.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.820]   We already talked about it a little bit,
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:40.240]   but let me ask again, why are we here?
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.000]   So I think you've raised this question
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.120]   in one of your presentations as like one of the things
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.360]   that we kind of as humans long to answer
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.480]   and the search for exoplanets is kind of part of that.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.260]   But what do you think is the meaning of it all, of life?
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.160]   - I wish I had a good answer for you.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.400]   (laughing)
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:05.160]   - I think you're the first person ever
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.560]   who refused to answer the question.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.320]   - It's not so much refusing, I just, yeah,
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:11.360]   I mean, I wish I had a better answer.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.760]   - It's-- - Why we're here.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.460]   - It's almost like the meaning is,
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:20.560]   wishing there was a meaning, wishing we knew.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:24.800]   - I love that, that's a great way to say it.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.160]   - Sarah, like I said, the book is excellent.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:30.000]   I admired your work from afar for a while
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.280]   and I think you're one of the great stars at MIT
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.240]   and makes me proud to be part of the community.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.100]   So thank you so much for your work.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.320]   Thank you for inspiring all of us.

[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:18.240]   And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:21.800]   Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.880]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
