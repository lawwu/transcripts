[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   A young listener of the podcast named John writes in to ask this, "Hello Pastor John,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.520]   I am in high school. At school I want to be well-liked, even thought of as cool,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.080]   but I'm also very scared that wanting to be popular will lead me into sin. How can I live
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.680]   godly and be well-liked?" Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.960]   Well, I'm glad he feels that way because that's right. I think being driven by coolness is deadly.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.160]   The problem with wanting to be cool in our culture is that cool is almost always defined by the fool.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.440]   So it's almost always cool equal fool. If you want to know what a fool is,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.240]   read the book of Proverbs in the Bible. In fact, I think every teenager, especially boys,
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.680]   should read Proverbs over and over and over again because of how clearly the Proverbs
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.640]   expose the stupidity of much that is considered cool. They make the cool guy who is getting a
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.560]   different girl every weekend look like an ox going to the slaughter, which he is. It's not cool. It
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.080]   looks cool. Everybody thinks it's cool. TV is going to tell you it's cool. Movies are going
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.040]   to tell you it's cool. Your friends are going to tell you it's cool. It's clearly not cool to regard
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.000]   him as not cool. God says he's an ox going to the slaughter where his throat is going to be slit,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.920]   and that is not going to look cool in the end. You can be smart. God is very smart,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.520]   and you should trust what God says about what's cool. Now, what about letting Jesus define what
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.560]   is cool? I mean really, really cool, eternally cool, viewed as cool by the smartest, strongest,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.760]   wisest people in the world. Here's what an example would be of cool. Jesus said—this is Mark 10:42—
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.840]   Jesus said to him, "You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.120]   them, and their great ones exercise authority over them, thinking it's cool. But it shall not be so
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.000]   among you, but whoever would be great among you." Now, substitute "whoever would be cool among you,"
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.200]   because I think great is just as good or 10 times better than cool. Whoever would be great, whoever
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   would be cool among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first—first cool—among you must
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.320]   be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and give his life a
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   ransom for many. So the essence of cool—cool before God, cool before the wisest, smartest people
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:05.520]   in the world—the essence of cool is being so poised, and so content, and so peaceful, and so
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.600]   satisfied, and so mature, and so confident, and so joyful, and so courageous in Christ that you are
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.160]   freed, you are set free from the insanity of the fool who thinks that being cool comes from your
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:33.680]   clothing. I mean, this is insane. Or your hair—hair! Come on! Or what movies you go to, or video games
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.720]   you've watched, or what phone you carry. This is insanity. You are a human being created in the
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.120]   image of God Almighty, destined to live forever and ever and ever and ever in hell or in heaven.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.960]   Nothing could be more stupid than to think that your significance, your worth, your greatness,
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.920]   your coolness is in what people think about your outward appearance instead of what they think
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.760]   about your inner reality that's going to live forever and ever and ever. So be one of those
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.400]   teenagers who wakes up from the lunacy of the cattle drive mentality, where the whole herd of
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.760]   cattle is going right over the cliff because some cool bull or some pretty heifer is out there
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:28.720]   leading the way right off a cliff. Here's the problem, usually, as I see it. Most teenagers
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.280]   in general—oh, I hope you're an exception to this. I hope everybody who's listening is an
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.440]   exception to this. But most teenagers in general are doing nothing of any real significance.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.920]   They're playing sports. They're going to parties. They're watching movies. They're
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.360]   playing video games. They're cleaning up the room. They're hanging out. They're
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   digging around on their computers. They're doing a little homework. And since nobody's doing
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.200]   anything of real significance, "cool" has to be defined in silly, superficial, stupid things
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:08.480]   like looks or cleverness or swagger. Good grief. But what if Christian young people began to do
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.960]   things that are really significant with their lives, began to be like Jesus, serving other
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   people rather than thinking that coolness is in how you look, making a difference in the world?
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.080]   Let me give you a crazy example just to help you feel what I feel when I talk about real service,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.760]   real significance, real cool in this world. The year is 1945. World War II is raging. Thousands
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.520]   of teenagers wanted to fight. They're too young. Jack Lucas fast talked his way into the Marines at
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:55.920]   age 14, 1942, fooling the recruits because he's big. And he stowed away later on a transport out
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   of Honolulu heading for Iwo Jima. And he survived on the boat by sympathetic Leathernecks passing him
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.880]   food. And now he's 17. He's been doing all this for three years. He's 17, stowed away.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:20.560]   And on D-Day when they went ashore, and got to remember 6,800 American soldiers are buried
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:28.480]   on this tiny island of Iwo Jima. And many of them, maybe most, were teenagers, 18, 19 year olds.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.840]   He landed without a rifle. They didn't even know he was on the boat. He grabbed one lying on the
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.720]   beach and fought his way inland. Now it's D-Day plus one. Jack and three comrades are crawling
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.560]   through the trench when eight Japanese sprang up in front of them. Jack shot one through the head,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.160]   his rifle jammed. As he's struggling, a grenade lands at his feet. He yells the warning to the
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.520]   others, rams the grenade down in the soft ash, and immediately another one rolls in. Jack,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.400]   17 years old, falls on both grenades. "You're going to die," he remembered thinking.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.600]   Then aboard the ship afterwards, the Samaritan ship, the doctors could scarcely believe it.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.120]   This is a quote, sorry for the language. "Maybe he was too damn young, too damn tough to die,"
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.280]   one said. He endured 21 reconstructive operations, became the nation's youngest
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.960]   Medal of Honor winner, the only high school freshman to receive it. Now when I read that,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:39.680]   my spine tingles. I'm 70 years old and my spine tingles. I don't want to waste my life on cool.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:48.080]   Ten thousand times more cool than having your hair twisted just so that nobody thinks you're so
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:57.360]   yesterday. So my simple challenge to John and thousands like him is don't try to be cool.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:06.960]   And don't try to be uncool. That's not the goal. Neither is. Try to be free from the herd
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:15.520]   mentality and be a radical servant. Focus not on what you're not going to do or not going to be,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:22.080]   but focus on what you are going to be. The things you are going to do for the good of others.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:29.760]   He who would be great cool, Jesus said, must be the servant of all.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:38.960]   Like Jesus who died for others that they might live. What would that look like at your high
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:49.520]   school, church, neighborhood? It would turn your whole focus around. How can I serve somebody today?
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:56.880]   Not how can I get somebody to like me today? What a crazy, radical, wonderful
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.280]   revolution. And I just say, John, lead the way in this.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.760]   Yeah, very helpful counsel for students, Pastor John. Thank you. And thank you,
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.560]   John, for the question. If you're a high school student or a college student and you face particular
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.240]   challenges on campus, tell us about them. No doubt you are not alone, and no doubt Scripture has some
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.600]   wise counsel to offer you. As always, you can find our audio feeds and our episode archive,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   and you can reach us via email to send those questions into us all through our online home
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:34.720]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn. We are going to return on Friday, but for the life of me,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.040]   I can't remember what the topic is right offhand, but I bet it will be important and interesting,
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.120]   or at least one of the two. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.760]   Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor John Piper. We'll see you next time.
