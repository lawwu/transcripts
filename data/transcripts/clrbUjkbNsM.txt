[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   Here's an email question, a pretty common question we get a lot about the role of faith
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.400]   and works in the Christian life.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.600]   "Hello Pastor John, my name is Anthony from Spain.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.140]   Romans chapter 2 verse 13 says it is the doers of the law who will be justified.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.880]   How am I to understand this verse in light of Romans 5 verse 1 and other verses that
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.040]   speak of our justification coming by faith alone and not by works?
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.240]   Why would Paul say the doers of the law are justified?"
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.760]   Well this is huge and wonderful.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.600]   It's such a crucial, crucial question.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.280]   So I hope I can tackle the verse but also state the bigger issue at stake, namely the
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.000]   relationship between being justified by faith apart from works of the law as any foundation
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.640]   for our being in God's favor on the one side and the necessity and inevitability of the
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:09.040]   fruit of good deeds or law keeping in order to show that that faith in Christ is real.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.200]   That's what's so hard for people to get a handle on these days.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.120]   So let me make a go at it.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.560]   Let's make the context clear if we can.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.880]   Romans 2, 11 to 13, Paul is concerned to show that the Jews, even though they have the law,
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.840]   will not be shown any partiality at the judgment day.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.720]   So he's explaining how the judgment, the last judgment, will proceed on the last day for
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.200]   those who have had the law and those who have not had the law.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.720]   Those who do not have any access to the law.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.560]   In verse 11, chapter 2, he lays down the principle.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.960]   God shows no partiality.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.240]   And then he explains how that works.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.720]   Even though the Jews have the law, which seems like, "God, that's partial," and the nations
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   don't.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.360]   He says, verse 12, "For all who have sinned without the law will perish without the law,"
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.440]   meaning God's not going to bring in the law of Moses to condemn anybody who's never heard
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   of the law of Moses.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.960]   He won't need to.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.360]   They're going to be judged on the basis of accesses that they had to law written on their
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.840]   heart or law written in nature or law written in conscience.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.720]   But he's not going to be partial in using a standard that somebody had access to that
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.400]   you didn't have access to.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.160]   And then the verse continues, "And all who have sinned under the law will be judged by
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   the law."
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.200]   So we're all going to be judged by the standards, the divine standards that we have access to,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.920]   and everybody has access to divine standards that we fall short of.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.640]   That's the point of Romans 1 and 2.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.160]   And then he adds the verse that Anthony is asking about, verse 13, "For it is not the
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.000]   hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   justified."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.400]   So, merely having the law and being able to hear the law because you have it will be of
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.000]   zero advantage at the judgment day.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.320]   It's because it's not having it, like, "Whoa, we've got the law, so we're going to pass
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.200]   judgment at the last day."
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.400]   No, it's how you respond to God's will, the law, not whether you have possession of it.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   That's what verse 13 is saying.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.760]   And then he proceeds to show in the following verses that the nations have a form of God's
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.680]   law written on their hearts, and he had already said in chapter 1 that they have a form of
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.400]   God's will written in the skies and in nature and now in their conscience.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.840]   Now in that context, a lot of very great teachers, people that I love and admire, have argued
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.400]   that verse 13 describes a hypothetical situation, not a real one.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.000]   So when Paul says, "Not the hearers of the law are righteous before God, but the doers
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.160]   of the law will be justified," referring to the last judgment, he's not saying that anybody
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.440]   actually does this.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.480]   This is a hypothetical.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.760]   Hypothetically, if there were doers of the law, they would be justified by the law, because
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.400]   if you're perfect, you're perfect.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.880]   And nobody does this, and therefore it's just hypothetical, and he's stating a principle.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.560]   So that's one way to understand Romans 2:13, so that it fits with Romans 3:28, for example,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.920]   or 5-1, which was mentioned.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.800]   We hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   That's Romans 3:28.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   And this way of understanding 2:13 as hypothetical is one way to keep those texts in perfect
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   harmony.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:10.440]   Now, my point is that there's another way to understand Romans 2:13 that also coheres
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.880]   with Romans 3:28, understood that way, and the doctrine of justification by faith alone
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.120]   apart from works of the law, meaning that the only foundation of our justification is
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.800]   Christ, His blood and righteousness, and that the only instrument that unites us to Christ
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.160]   and His righteousness is faith and faith alone.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.200]   And I believe that's what the Bible teaches.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   Being doers of the law need not mean being perfect doers of the law with no failures
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   at all.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.560]   If being doers of the law means perfect, then clearly it has to be hypothetical.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.200]   It may mean that one loves the law, trusts God for forgiveness when he stumbles or fails
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.560]   to measure up to God's will, leans on God's provision for perfect righteousness, and seeks
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.000]   to walk in a way pleasing to the Lord.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   In other words, a person today—I'm thinking now 21st century—a person today may be a
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:26.400]   doer of the law who trusts Jesus as the only basis of their justification before God, who
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:34.160]   in the power of that faith by the Spirit walks in a manner worthy of the Lord, and then at
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.880]   the last judgment, Christ will be the basis of our acceptance—Christ alone, the basis
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.760]   of our acceptance with the Father—and our life of obedience, doing the law, will be
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.600]   brought in to confirm, just confirm, that our faith was real, because faith works through
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.760]   love, so doing the law will not be the basis of our being in God's favor, but the evidence
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.960]   that we are trusting Christ, united to Christ, and thus necessary at the last day.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.460]   Now why do I think that is in fact what the verse teaches?
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.520]   And here are a few reasons.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.360]   First, the statement "doers of the law will be justified" does not sound in the
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.440]   context like a hypothetical statement.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.800]   It just sounds like that's true, that happened.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.200]   It sounds like a statement of fact.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.880]   So if the statement can stand, as is in Paul's thinking, then I want it to stand.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   Secondly, Romans 2:13 says "doers of the law will be justified."
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:55.120]   It does not say, "By doing the works of the law, you will be justified."
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.000]   That would be a really big problem, from my view, if it said that.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.760]   It simply says that the one who will be justified is the one who is a doer of the law.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.880]   There's no causal connection asserted between the two at all.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.640]   So the verse is not a contradiction of Romans 3:20 that says, "By the works of the law,
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.000]   no flesh will be justified."
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.040]   There is nothing in Romans 2:13 that keeps us from believing in justification by faith
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.600]   alone.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.600]   Faith is required by the law.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   Faith is the sole means of union with Christ, whose righteousness vindicates us at the judgment.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.120]   All the other obedience that comes from that faith is fruit, fruit of that union, not the
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.440]   means of that union.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.440]   That's so crucial.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.880]   All the obedience that a Christian performs, all that obedience is fruit that comes from
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:02.440]   a faith-established union, not a works-established union, a faith-established union with Christ.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.900]   And so that fruit is not a means of being a good tree.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.080]   It's the result of being a good tree, and you get to be a good tree by faith alone in
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.600]   union with Jesus and then the Holy Spirit moving.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:24.160]   So Romans 2:13 is not a contradiction on my reading either of Paul's teaching of justification
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.800]   by faith alone.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.520]   Third observation.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:36.000]   There are real examples in the New Testament of real people who are doers of the law.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.300]   This is not hypothetical.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.400]   For example, Luke 1, 5, and 6.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.320]   In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias of the division
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.200]   of Abijah, and he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth, and
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.080]   they were both righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.600]   and requirements of the Lord.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.600]   Period.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   Not hypothetical.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.480]   That's the way they were described.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.000]   And of course they were sinners.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.240]   Of course they needed to be justified by faith.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:12.800]   But they were so in tune with the heart and mind of God that they were described as righteous.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.560]   They were described as walking blamelessly.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.040]   They were described as keeping the commandments because every time they stumbled, they took
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:28.320]   the laws and the gospels opportunity to repent, to apply themselves to the sacrifices in the
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.960]   Old Testament and now the Christ in the New Testament to cover their sins so that they
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.720]   could be described in their path of general obedience as blameless and righteous.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.360]   So it's a real couple, not a hypothetical couple, who would be described as doers of
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   the law.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   Here's another one.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.640]   1 Corinthians 7, 19.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:56.120]   Paul says, "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but what matters is keeping the
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.200]   commandments of God."
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.120]   And he's saying that to Christians.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.040]   And he had just said in Galatians 5, 6, "In Christ, circumcision doesn't matter, uncircumcision
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   doesn't matter.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   What matters is faith working through love."
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.280]   So if you lay those two texts on top of each other, faith working through love is described
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.120]   as keeping the commandments of God because in Paul's understanding in Romans 13, love
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.440]   is a fulfillment of the law.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.000]   Love does the commandments of God that the law requires.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.920]   And so the works of love that come through Christian faith is a keeping of the commandments,
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.840]   and the person who does them can be described as a doer of the law.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.760]   Here's a third example, Romans 8, 3 and 4.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.520]   "What the law could not do, weak as it was to the flesh, God did, sending His own Son
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.840]   in the likeness of sinful flesh and forced sin.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.760]   He condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.440]   So that's substitutionary penal atonement.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.240]   So that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.720]   the flesh but according to the Spirit.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.080]   Now that's who we are as Christians.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.600]   When we walk according to the Spirit, we fulfill the just requirement of the law.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.900]   That is, we keep the commandments.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.600]   That is, we love.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.880]   We are doers of the law, not sinlessly perfect law keepers.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.000]   Nobody is, nobody ever has been except Jesus, which is why we depend on Him.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.680]   But rather, radically transform people through faith in the power of the Holy Spirit, leaning
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.760]   on the grace of God that comes to us through Jesus Christ.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   So Romans 2, 13 does not have to be hypothetical.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:50.800]   There are doers of the law in the New Testament as we've just seen in those three examples.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:57.200]   And here's the last thing that I would say in favor of taking this verse this way rather
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.000]   than as a hypothetical statement.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.360]   In Romans, it fits the context in Romans 2, in the verses just gone before.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   It fits the context.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.000]   So here's what Paul says in Romans 2, 6 and 7.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.560]   "God will render to each one according to his works, to those who by patience in well-doing."
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.360]   Now that's, I think, the same as saying those who are doers of the law.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:30.720]   Those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, He will give
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.880]   eternal life, which is just another way of saying they will be justified at the last
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.560]   day.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:44.360]   So in the very context where we find 2, 13, Paul has already been teaching that eternal
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:51.120]   life, which is essentially the same as final justification, Paul is essentially teaching
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:59.640]   that we must be so transformed by our faith in Jesus Christ and through His atonement
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:07.560]   and blood that we persevere in doing good, and that becomes the narrow way then that
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.680]   leads to life, and that will be brought in at the last day, not as the ground of our
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   acceptance, not as the ground of being in God's favor, but as evidence that we have
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.240]   trusted God.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:30.960]   So my answer to Anthony is that he is right to be jealous, to safeguard the doctrine of
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:37.640]   justification by faith alone, apart from works of the law, as the basis of our acceptance,
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:45.560]   and he is also right—I hope he will be right—that he is jealous to preserve the biblical truth
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:55.280]   that saving faith always bears the fruit of doing the will of God, just like we saw, say,
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:04.440]   in 1 John 1, 9, where we repent and then he is faithful and just to forgive us of our
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:11.680]   sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness, provided that we are walking in the light,
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.640]   as verse 7 says.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.480]   Man, this is an incredible judicious balance here on the controversial discussion of faith
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.200]   and obedience, and very much needed today, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.520]   This is one of those episodes that I would commend that you listen to and read the transcript
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.960]   at the same time to really grasp all the nuances that have been said here.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.400]   And we release a transcript of each episode simultaneously, along with the audio recordings,
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:44.280]   and you can find those transcripts at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn, as well as, of course, you can find the audio
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.960]   for all 825+ episodes that we've released to date.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   I know a lot of users out there use the site and the APJ app as a sort of FAQ for pastoral
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.600]   questions, so please make use of it in whatever ways, personally, and to care for others in
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.040]   your church and family.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.280]   Well, tomorrow we talk about social justice and acts of kindness, and ask, "What is the
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   ultimate aim of our works anyways?"
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.400]   I'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
