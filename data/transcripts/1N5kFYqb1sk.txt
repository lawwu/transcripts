[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Pastor John, you once said in a message, "Everything I write is to try and find a way to say the
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.080]   obvious in a way that will make people bolt awake and come alive in Jesus."
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.760]   Explain that for us.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.980]   Obviously this awakening is the work of the Holy Spirit, but what role does creative language
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.120]   play as a means of awakening sinners?
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.960]   I have been wrestling with that question for years and years.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.080]   I did a talk, "Is There Christian Eloquence?"
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.040]   I think it was in 2006 or something at one of our national conferences.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880]   The recent thing that I did on Herbert is related to that.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.960]   I'm always thinking as a preacher and a writer, "Does my language make any difference?"
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.720]   Because clearly the Bible teaches, "I planted, Apollos watered, God gave the growth."
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.680]   That is the decisive growth giver, or Ephesians 2.5, "God made us alive when we were dead."
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.440]   Dead men are not impressed by vocabulary.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:13.160]   God raises the dead, and they're not raised by my poetic effort.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:24.000]   In 1 Peter 1.23, we are born not of perishable seed, but imperishable through the Word of
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   God.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.200]   The perishable seed is the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.720]   He does the beginning, and the instrument is the Word of God, which verse 25 says is
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.040]   the gospel, which we preach.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.520]   Jesus said in John 3, "The wind blows where it wills."
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   We don't know where it comes from, where it's going.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.160]   So are all who are born of the Spirit.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.400]   So the message of the Bible is God raises the dead.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.220]   God causes people to be born again, and it is not decisively our instrumentality.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.600]   So the question is really urgent for me, because should I draw the conclusion?
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.280]   Well, since God can save people through bad grammar, and He can save people through flat
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.840]   demeanor, and He can save people through prosaic speech, and heavily accented English, or German,
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.560]   or whatever language people are hearing the gospel in, and He can do it through faulty
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.840]   exegesis and lopsided presentations, and hypocritical preachers even.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.000]   I mean, God can save people just about any way He wants, provided the rudiments of the
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   gospel get through to people.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Should I just draw the conclusion?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.600]   Well, okay, sorah, sorah, don't teach preaching, and don't make any effort to say anything
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   in a creative or impactful way.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.680]   And here's my best shot now.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.320]   Okay, so I keep working on this, trying to find ways to say it and live it that are biblical.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.160]   I don't think language is a matter of indifference in the matter of bringing people to Christ
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.280]   or sanctifying people in Christ.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.760]   But the two things I would say is, one, we should avoid efforts to preempt the work of
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.680]   the Holy Spirit by our language.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.840]   And that language may be sloppy intentionally, it may be casual intentionally, it may be
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.280]   artsy intentionally, or literary, or refined.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.360]   Any effort, whether you're talking low culture or high culture, to try to manipulate people
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   by your language, preempt the Holy Spirit, get them saved through your design, we should
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   abominate that, throw that away.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.360]   There should be a feel about our praying and our preaching that says, "This man is not
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.640]   presuming that his words save sinners, that God saves sinners and uses his words."
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   Which secondly, then, implies for me this.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:05.120]   The Holy Spirit is sent into the world, according to John 14, to glorify Jesus Christ.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.640]   So the Holy Spirit is going to open the eyes of the blind in order for them to see Jesus,
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.960]   which means my words should be portraying the Jesus that the Holy Spirit wants people
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   to see when he raises them from the dead, or he might not raise them from the dead and
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.320]   give them eyes to see because there's nothing there true to see.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:35.120]   Which means my words are a portrait in front of people which is somehow worthy of Jesus,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.000]   and the Holy Spirit says, "Oh, I like that portrait.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.440]   I will now grant this person the eyes to see that portrait."
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   And then if I ask myself, "Okay, what is it about Jesus that I should portray?"
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.840]   Well, he's true, and he's beautiful, and he's stunning, and he's amazing, and he's
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.520]   something which says something about the kind of descriptions I want to make of him.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:07.760]   So that's my reason for giving effort, like you just read to me in that question about
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.680]   trying to bring people bold, awake, by saying something striking.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.360]   All I mean by that is Jesus really is striking.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.080]   Jesus really is amazing.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.480]   Jesus really is worthy of the most wonderful or the most surprising ways of describing
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:34.560]   him truly, and the Holy Spirit regularly honors that effort by opening the eyes of the blind
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.120]   to see a truly described Jesus.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.160]   Thank you, Pastor John.
