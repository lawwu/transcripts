[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.640]   Welcome to Portfolio Rescue. This is our show where you, the viewer, determine our topics.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.480]   We've got a special episode today. I am sitting in the same room as Duncan right now. It looks
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.680]   like we're on different screens, but we're here together. I flew all the way into New
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.560]   York just to see Duncan. We've got some special guests today, so this is going to be fun.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.760]   Remember, if you have a question, email us at AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Duncan, how's
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.120]   it going? I think Duncan was a little nervous today because there's a lot of moving parts.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840]   It's easier to do it over Zoom than it is in person, right, Duncan?
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.240]   Yeah, it's a little complicated being in the same room. If you hear some echo, that's what's
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.240]   going on.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.280]   All right, all good. All right, let's do question number one.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.560]   Okay, so first up, we have a question from Mike. Mike writes, "I believe I'm in a somewhat
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.960]   unique retirement position. As a career firefighter in South Carolina, after 25 years of service,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.280]   my pension should end up being about 60% of my salary at retirement. I tend to ignore
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.040]   the fact that I'll have a pension and just try to invest for retirement the same as everyone
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.280]   else, a Roth IRA, wife's 403B, a bit of crypto sprinkled in for fun, etc. Should a future
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.000]   lifetime pension influence my investment strategy or risk tolerance? Would your strategies and
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.520]   tactics change if you had a lifetime pension waiting for you once you hit 50?"
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.280]   The good news here is that this guy has a pension. I did some research for my last book,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.440]   Everything You Need to Know About Saving for Retirement, and I found in the early '80s,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.240]   it was basically 60% of all workers had a pension in the United States. The number I
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.640]   found for today, it's closer to 17% and probably heading lower as people go into 401(k), so
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   this is pretty good.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.080]   I tried to put some value on it, so I reached out to Nick Magiulli, Nicky Numbers, our data
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.720]   guy here. "John, let's do a chart on ..." I tried to figure out the value of what this
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.640]   pension could be like. I did some values here, and you see this is the annual pension payout,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   so 25 to 100 grand I put per year, and I put it at different discount rates and tried to
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.840]   take the present value of those cash flows to today. You could see that could be worth
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.080]   hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars for someone. This is a good problem
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   to have.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.500]   Let's talk about it. The way I look at this is this is not so much a investing question
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.360]   as it is a financial planning question, so I decided to bring in one of our financial
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.960]   advisors here who actually is based in New York, Alex Palumbo, one of our rockstar financial
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.680]   advisors who works this stuff on clients all the time. Let's bring him in, John. Alex,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.880]   how's it going?
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.880]   Hello.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.320]   So, you get a client that comes to you and they have some sort of income source. It could
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   be a pension like this, which is, I think, a good problem to have. It's out there into
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.440]   the future. I'm sure people sometimes worry, "Is it going to be there for me?" But how
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.120]   do you think through something like this where someone's getting this steady income, and
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.920]   then how does that flow into how they plan their portfolio out?
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.840]   Right. I mean, theoretically, of course, you do not need to take on as much risk as an
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.880]   individual who's going to retire at 50 as someone with no pension. That's pretty obvious,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.800]   right? To use an example, let's say that this is going to be worth $150,000 a year every
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.120]   year you're alive. Actuarial speaking, if you make it to 50, you should live till about
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.680]   age 85 or age 93 is the expectancy, which means that that pension is going to pay you
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   out between $5 million to $6.5 million total, right? Assuming you'll cost a living adjustment
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.320]   too, which there could be. So, of course, you'll be able to achieve your family's financial
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.480]   goals more than that person who retires with a $2, or $3, or $4, or $5 million 401(k) balance,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   right?
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.520]   So, theoretically, you can, of course, take on less risk.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.040]   A lot of people ask, "Should I view this pension as a bond and does that allow me to take more
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.280]   equity risk?" How do you think about that question?
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.080]   Right. So, the big elephant in the room, the Michael Batnick, however, is the fact that
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.920]   is a sequence of returns risk, which you wrote a blog post about this pretty recently. So,
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.540]   the counter argument is the fact that you will not need to live off as much of a percentage
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.200]   of your assets if you do have that pension coming in as someone who needs to only live
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   off their 401(k), right? So, to assign numbers to it, let's say that you have a $2 million
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.280]   portfolio and you need to live off $100,000 from that. That's about a 5% burn. But let's
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.600]   say the market is down 50%. Now, you have $1 million and you need to live off $100,000.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.000]   That's a 10% burn rate, which is way too high. Versus if the market is up 10%, now you have
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.760]   $2.2 million, then you're living off about a 4% rate.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.520]   If you have this pension supplementing $80,000 per year, then you only have to live off of
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.920]   $20,000 per year. So, then your burn rate ranges from 0.9% to 2%, and both of those
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.760]   are extremely sustainable. So, the counterpoint to that is you need to live off less of your
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.160]   investable assets. So, theoretically, maybe you can take on more equity risk.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.200]   Right. So, you might be able to take more equity risk. You might not have to, though,
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.960]   which is a good place to be. Yeah, that's the whole point, right.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.440]   Do we say thank you to your service to firefighters? Is that okay?
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.360]   Yeah. I'm in New York, so let's do it. All right. Duncan, next question.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.800]   Okay. So, up next we have the following. What are your thoughts on using an S-block security-based
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.120]   line of credit against a fairly large brokerage account, $250,000 to $300,000, to either borrow
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.040]   for a primary residence up to $150,000 or, say, $50,000 for a rental property down payment?
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.660]   This doesn't seem to be discussed very often anywhere except related to the extremely wealthy
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.640]   borrowing against their equity holdings. So, I wanted to get your feedback.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.900]   There's definitely been some more of this lately. The Wall Street Journal had a piece
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.360]   on this this past summer, and they said that borrowing against your securities in your
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.160]   portfolio has grown from $30 billion in 2016 to nearly $70 billion as of this summer. So,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.080]   people are definitely doing it. Obviously, the low rates has a lot to do with it. But,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.760]   Alex, I'm sure this is a question you get from clients, and I'm trying to think through,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.840]   what are the advantages of borrowing against your portfolio instead of taking out a loan
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   from a bank?
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.640]   Yeah. You said the study was from this summer, where people are borrowing more?
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.420]   Shocking, right? Now that the market's ripping higher. So, I agree that S-blocks are not
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.360]   discussed enough. I'm a huge fan of the convenient and rather simple process of placing a security
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.240]   back line of credit on your portfolio. They're free to set up. There's no cost in place unless
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.400]   it's actually tapped, and there's no underwriting necessary because they're collateralized by
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.720]   the securities in your portfolio. They're perfect for a client who wants to sell their
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.440]   primary residence to move into another home, but don't have the liquidity to afford a
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.180]   down payment. But even if they do, there's no point of using their cash supply or sell
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.800]   their securities when we can simply leverage the assets within their investment portfolio,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.640]   borrow against it, use the borrow funds to pay for their new home. Then, once their old
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.480]   home is sold, they pay off their S-block balance, and you've now bought a new home without recognizing
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.560]   any capital gains or selling any funds from your portfolio and missing any time in the
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.440]   market, which, of course, tends to go up. And also the qualitative factors of you don't
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.040]   have to rush or feel bootstrapped that you won't have enough money for a new home or
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.560]   that you're missing time in the market.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.680]   The point here would be, this is crazy. You're borrowing against your portfolio. Markets
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.600]   are at all-time highs. Interest rates are low right now. What happens if your portfolio
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.480]   gets crushed? Aren't you an idiot for borrowing against it? What's the downside here?
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.680]   Yeah, there's some pretty, I think, apparent downside that might not be, you know, considered
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.800]   by certain people given what the market's been doing this past year. But this specific
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.240]   person asked, what if I borrow 150 grand against a 250k portfolio? That's a 60% borrow rate.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.920]   Depending on the portfolio, you can really only borrow like 70%. I mean, assuming it's
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   invested in equity.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.000]   Right. What do you think is like too high of a percentage that would make you feel uneasy?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.640]   It really depends on the situation, but 60% definitely seems like I'd feel very uneasy,
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.880]   right? So what happens is a downturn in the market, the underlying collateralized securities
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.200]   value is heavily impacted, and then a maintenance goal could be issued. And now you're forced
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.000]   to sell securities at either an all-time low or an extremely low point. And that really
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.680]   defeats the whole purpose of the S-block, right, in keeping your portfolio intact.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.640]   Well, those rates are really low right now, but they're not fixed. They're variable
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.160]   on the S-block. The interest is not tax deductible. So moral of the story is, I would make sure
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.400]   that you have an actual payment plan in mind and in place before you take the S-block.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.640]   This person seems like they just want to have this S-block going in perpetuity with no repayment
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.360]   plan to just YOLO 60% of the portfolio. And that just doesn't really seem like it's
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   prudent advice.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.640]   And it makes sense why people want to do these. Wealthy people hate paying taxes, right? So
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.240]   this is a way to skirt taxes and borrow against it. And you feel like you're borrowing against
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.280]   yourself. It makes a lot of sense.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   And there's a lot of good reasons to do this, of course. But just think about, you
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   know, 2000, 2009. If you were borrowing from tech stocks in your portfolio, the S&P, you're
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.720]   down 10% after 10 years, while you were paying that interest rate for 10 years. And now,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   so you're paying that interest, and now your portfolio is down in value. That's
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   the risk.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.080]   Perfect. Thank you, Alex.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   Thank you.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.080]   Duncan, next question.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:12.680]   Okay. So next up, this is a nice short and sweet one. In your opinion, do government
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.440]   yields still give any real signal in terms of future growth and inflation, or has it
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.680]   all been obscured by the bond buying by the Fed? Everyone's favorite topic, the Fed.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.240]   Yes. All right, John, let's do a chart on here. This is one of my favorite charts of
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   the year. So I've plotted out here the 10-year treasury rate versus the US inflation rate
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.440]   over the past five years. You can see most years, these things plot along pretty nicely.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.080]   And they look like they're following each other pretty closely. Like, oh, that makes
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.320]   sense. Bond yields and inflation have a relationship. Now you have this huge alligator teeth, right?
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.160]   Inflation has spiked to over 6%. Bond yields are still at 1.4. They spiked a little bit.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.840]   Now they're falling again.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.800]   We're going to bring on one of my favorite macro people, who happened to be in New York.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.960]   I'm using my time here to sort of use people. So Cullen Roche is here from Pragmatic Capitalism.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:07.480]   Also has his own ETF. He has his own advisory shop. Cullen, what do you think?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.800]   Do you think that all of this monetary policy is obscuring the signals that we can get from
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.600]   simple things like interest rates that people would use in the past to say, hey, if growth
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.480]   is rising, rates should be rising too. And if inflation is rising, rates should rise.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.160]   Like, that makes sense on a textbook perspective. We're not getting that anymore. Why not?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.080]   Yeah. This is hilarious, by the way, because people who fast forward this are going to
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.680]   see me and they're going to think, like, how did Alex get 20 years older and uglier? But
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.320]   so this is something that a question I get a lot because people think that the 30 year
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.640]   treasury or the treasury market in general is some sort of like totally free market.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.000]   And really, the way that I like to explain, especially the Federal Reserve market, is
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.880]   that the Federal Reserve is essentially a manipulation of what would have otherwise
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.360]   been free banking. So, you know, the whole manipulation or not manipulation story is
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.960]   just kind of nonsense because the system is what it is. And the Federal Reserve, by being
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.020]   involved as the central bank around all of the public banks, is by definition a manipulation
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.880]   and they have to set an interest rate. And so the analogy that I like to use to think
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.480]   of all of this stuff is that think of the Fed as basically walking a dog and the long
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.600]   bond is basically the dog. The Fed is holding the leash and the leash where they hold it
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.920]   being the overnight rate is super tight. They have absolute control of that rate and how
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   much it can move. They let the dog on the farther out end of the leash kind of wander
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.800]   at times, but the Fed still has pretty tight control over that dog for the most part to
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.760]   the extent that they want it to. They could theoretically rein that thing all the way
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.600]   in if they wanted to and have absolute control if they decided to. I mean, if they went out
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.200]   and they did QE on the 30 year and they said the 30 year bond, we're going to be a buyer
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:59.120]   of the 30 year bond at zero percent, the 30 year interest rate would collapse. So, you
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.280]   know, thinking of all of this in terms of the way the market exists now, the Fed kind
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.240]   of lets the bond market wander. But for the most part in today's environment, I think
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:13.160]   that what's happening is that the Fed's been really clear that the dog has kind of started
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.800]   to wander a little bit. You know, interest rates popped a little bit from the beginning
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.080]   of really when COVID happened, interest rates collapsed and then they kind of popped back
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.040]   up and they've kind of started to come back down. And a lot of that is the signaling from
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.880]   the Fed that they're pulling that leash and they're making it very clear, look, we're
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.840]   not going to let this dog get too far away from us. And so a lot of that is sort of based
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.940]   on the market signals that I think are becoming increasingly apparent that the Fed basically
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:46.200]   thinks inflation is not going to get out of control for a sustained period of time.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.640]   So do you think that this is, I mean, obviously people say, well, the Fed's buying all these
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.040]   bonds that has to do with it. I also think there's a lot of people are still starved
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.800]   for yield and retirees want to de-risk their portfolios. And so money is still flowing
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   into fixed income.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.240]   It's actually thinking of it in terms of like the relative safe asset shortage in the global
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.520]   monetary system. The U.S. Treasury bond is still the safe asset. And so if there's a
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.320]   shortage of safe assets in the whole world, especially in a world where inflation is in
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.040]   some places much, much higher, the Treasury bond is still the super safe asset that a
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   lot of people go to.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.600]   Do you put any credence to the signal of, okay, inflation is way up here and bond rates
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.880]   are down here. Do you say, well, the bond market is obviously smarter than everyone
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.080]   else and the bond market is signaling that this inflation is not going to last? Like
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.200]   how much, how much do you put into that signal?
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.480]   Yeah, I don't love the, the whole bond market is smarter than everybody narrative. I tend
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.660]   to think it really is sort of a function. The Fed's trying to guess what future economic
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.280]   growth is going to look like. And so the Fed being at 0% basically is signaling that the
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.320]   Fed thinks future economic growth is unlikely to be that great in the long run. And so they're
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.040]   still trying to stimulate things to some degree. And so the fit, the bond market kind of just
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:03.200]   follows that in the, the low yields of the last like 20, 30 years to me is more a signal
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.000]   that economic growth has just been kind of low and stagnant. Not that, you know, it doesn't
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.680]   mean that the stock market can't go up in those environments. A lot of the times, in
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.160]   fact, when, when interest rates are really stable, the stock market does really well.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.240]   So could that also mean that we're thinking this is a signal that we think this current
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.960]   burst of economic growth is probably not going to last, right? Like that it's going to go
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.480]   back to where it was at two to 3% or whatever, and it's not going to remain high.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.960]   The most interesting outcome here is that as we kind of like navigate into 2022, you
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.560]   know, what are the likely scenarios here? And does the, does the bond market actually
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.880]   start to look pretty smart in the current environment? Because the big things that we're
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.080]   seeing as we head into 2022 are, you're going to start having a big peel off of fiscal policy
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.880]   and statistically, you're going to start seeing the data is going to be basically the opposite
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.440]   of what we had from COVID, which was this big base effect. You now have a top effect
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:01.400]   where the data spiked a ton, and now you're doing year over year comps on a higher comp,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.360]   which means that the inflation data is likely to start moderating around the summertime
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.400]   purely based on statistics. And then you've got things like if the supply shortages and
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.880]   like, you know, the LA port starts to ease up, which is pretty likely and looking like
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:21.280]   it's already starting to happen, then you could get into 2022. Inflation starts to moderate.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.680]   The bond market starts to look pretty smart. And then you have like an outlier situation
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.760]   where we'll, you know, we pumped all this money into the economy and things got really
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.960]   good, but what if you get some give back? And then the economy starts to kind of look.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.680]   Which is essentially what happened in like World War II. You had this huge spike in inflation,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.560]   rates didn't go anywhere, and inflation came back down. And I don't know, to me, for the
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.640]   government, that's almost best case scenario, because they inflate away some of the debt.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:50.240]   Right? Isn't that the idea? Potentially? Yeah. I mean, inflating away the debt, I don't know
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.600]   if that's really their goal. I mean, it's a byproduct of what they're doing. I mean,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.800]   to me, this was a lot like a war in the sense that the government kind of just threw the
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.400]   kitchen sink at it because we didn't know how bad this was going to get. I think it's
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.640]   easy to kind of look at it in retrospect and say, oh, we did too much. But at the time,
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.600]   you know, this looked like an atomic bomb hitting the economy.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.440]   All right, Duncan, we got one more interest rate question for Cullen.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:23.640]   Okay, so next up, we have Nicholas from Sweden, which is cool. So Nicholas wrote, "This market
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.000]   sure doesn't make much sense. I was wondering what your take is on treasury yields. Inflation
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.480]   is running high, money is being printed like never before, and the stock market is only
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.800]   going up. But still, the treasury yields have been falling. So what do you think will happen
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800]   when the market goes down?"
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.120]   All right, John, let's do a chart on here. I just plotted out, going back to the 1960s,
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.440]   the 10-year treasury and 30-year mortgage bond. And I put the gray scales in there that
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.080]   shows the recession. Every time there's been a recession since then, interest rates have
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:56.520]   fallen on the 30-year mortgage, on the 10-year treasury, whatever you want to say. I don't
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.200]   see why that relationship would have to. I mean, you get this, the Fed lowers interest
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.560]   rates, right? So that happens because they're trying to stimulate the economy. Investors
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.600]   have this flight to safety. I don't see why either of those factors would go away. I guess
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.240]   it's just, do we keep getting a lower floor every time there's a recession?
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.720]   I mean, what's the alternative? You know, we kind of got a little blip of this in the
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.320]   last couple of weeks where treasury bonds jumped 5% or so in the last couple of weeks
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.480]   when the stock market started to kind of get jittery. And to me, there is no alternative
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.200]   in terms of the truly safe assets. I mean, Bitcoin's not the thing, and gold's not the
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   thing.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.400]   So, you know, so we have to get negative rates eventually, right? Like, isn't that...
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.720]   You know, I was talking to Nick Majulie the other night about this, and he asked me, he
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.240]   said, you know, gun to head, where do rates go, 5% or 0%? I was like, oh, two guns to
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:54.320]   my head. I'll put two guns to my head and bet you that it goes to 0%. I mean, to me,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.400]   the fact that rates didn't rise that much in an environment where, you know, we literally
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:08.000]   printed $7 trillion of new debt, and the Fed was stimulating up the wazoo, and CPI is at
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.960]   6%, and interest rates are still pretty low. If that doesn't make long-term interest rates
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.560]   rise, then, you know, it's starting to look like, well, what will? You know, outside of
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.320]   like the Jack Dorsey hyperinflation scenario, it's starting to look like, well, yeah, it
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.200]   seems like the demand for these things is so strong that the likelihood of going to
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.040]   zero is just so much higher than...
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.240]   I think it's possible in like 30 years from now, people are going to look back and say,
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.840]   how did that ever happen in the '70s and '80s, right? Like that period is going to, I think
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.000]   that's going to be the outlier. More than this period, if we have it between like 1%
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.880]   and 4% or something, or 3%, or whatever the ceiling is now. It's hard to, because people
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.720]   have always said, like, refinance your mortgage now, because mortgage rates are going nowhere
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.120]   but higher, and every time they go lower, right?
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:01.560]   I mean, people are so scarred by the '70s, especially like generations older than us.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:08.200]   But it was such a unique situation. And it's kind of countered almost all of the big macro
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.320]   trends that are going on now where, you know, the demographics were totally different from
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.280]   the baby boomers in the '70s. The tech trends didn't really exist in the '70s. And so it's
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.680]   just like completely different in terms of its environment when compared to the '70s.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.440]   All right. Someone in the comments here says that Cullen has very good hair. I take that
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.440]   as an affront, because I thought I had the best hair. Oh, Alex thinks he's got good hair
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   too. All right.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.920]   It looks like Cullen's picture also first, so I don't know what's going on with that.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.880]   Okay, well, someone wanted to get a good shot of him. All right. Thank you, Cullen. Thank
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.880]   you, Alex.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   I turned myself off for the sake of these guys.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.720]   For coming in. Duncan, how did we do? First time live.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.760]   It was good. Yeah, it was an experience.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:53.560]   All right. We'll do a post-mortem after this and see what happened. Remember, if you have
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:00.160]   a question for us, it's AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Next week, I'll be back in my office in Michigan.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.240]   Duncan will be in New York still. Thanks, everyone, for watching. And thanks to Cullen
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   and Alex for coming on board. See you next week.
