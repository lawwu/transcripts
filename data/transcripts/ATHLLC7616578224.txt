[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.200]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.840]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here today.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.880]   Now, as much as we think about money often being like math,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.720]   turns out money is often a lot more emotional,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.000]   about relationships and the mindset you're in
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.140]   and not the actual dollars and cents.
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.080]   And if that doesn't sound right to you,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.720]   then definitely go back and listen to my episode
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.440]   a few weeks ago with Ramit Sethi,
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.420]   or check out his podcast or his Netflix show,
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.440]   and I am confident it will change your mind.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.280]   So if money is a lot more emotional than rational,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.660]   how do you make sense of it?
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.840]   Well, that is one of the skills of my guest today,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.960]   Erin Lowry.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.040]   She calls herself a financial translator,
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.200]   and she's the writer behind "Broke Millennial,"
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.400]   the website and the book series.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.840]   She's written and spoken on personal finance issues
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.080]   for more than a decade,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.860]   and focuses a lot of her effort on helping people
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.880]   have productive and healthy conversations
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.800]   about money issues with others.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.560]   Whether it's among friends, parents,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.920]   or other family members, or even romantic partners.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.580]   Now, I know I first read her work many years
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.860]   before starting this podcast,
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.200]   probably when I was trying to figure out
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.760]   how to stop being a broke millennial myself.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.340]   And I've wanted to invite Erin on the show for a while,
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.320]   but I wasn't quite sure what the right topic would be.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.040]   Then I was reading her most recent book,
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.840]   "Broke Millennial Talks Money,"
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.160]   and I got to chapter seven and it clicked.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.440]   The chapter was titled,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.620]   "How to Ask Your Parents
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.000]   "If You Need to Take Care of Them Financially."
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.380]   As soon as I read it, I thought,
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.240]   "Hmm, I haven't had that conversation."
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.800]   And I'm guessing most other people haven't either.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.120]   So today we're gonna talk about why it is important
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.200]   to have that conversation with your parents,
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.920]   how to actually have the conversation
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.560]   with some specific scripts you can use,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.000]   and what to do next after you have the conversation,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.600]   depending on how it goes.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.020]   But I also wanna spend time on a few other topics
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.420]   Erin's an expert on.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.680]   So we're gonna spend a little bit of time
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280]   on engagement rings, pre-nups and post-nups,
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.560]   how to talk about money with friends,
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.600]   lending money to others, and a lot more.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.880]   So let's get into it right after this.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.280]   Erin, welcome to the show.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.440]   - Wonderful to be here.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   - Can you start by just telling people
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.180]   why having this kind of a conversation
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.200]   with your parents is so important?
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.960]   - Well, you know, it's funny that you mentioned
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.440]   the title of chapter seven in the intro,
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.760]   because it's much gentler than what I really wanted to say.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.600]   And my greater point here is,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.280]   are you your parents' retirement plan?
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.240]   That is really the question that all of us
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   need to get the answer to.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.600]   My editor didn't totally love that strong of language,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.760]   which I understand.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.800]   But that's the critical question for a lot of us,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.440]   is how are your parents doing financially, for one?
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.280]   Two, will they be able to comfortably retire
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.480]   and live out their days with some form of dignity?
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.400]   And most of us don't wanna ask that question,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.320]   and most of our parents don't wanna give us the answer.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   Even if the answer's yes, even if it's,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.880]   "We're great, we're flush with cash,"
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.840]   they might not feel comfortable talking to you about it,
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.760]   particularly because it can feel
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.000]   like you're parenting your parent,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.600]   which is a very delicate balance to be walking.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.720]   But the big thing is, if you don't have the conversation,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.080]   what's gonna probably happen is at some point,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.480]   there will be an inciting incident,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.040]   whether it's a healthcare situation,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.140]   or job loss for your parent,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.560]   or some sort of disability that happens,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.080]   and then it will become very apparent
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.440]   whether or not they can financially support themselves,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.360]   and whether or not you need to step in.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.120]   And if you don't have that information,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.160]   and you haven't been laying the financial foundation
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.840]   yourself to do that, are you able to step in?
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.720]   Do you have the financial freedom to do so,
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.760]   especially if you've gotten married?
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.880]   Maybe you have kids, maybe you have an expensive house,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.120]   maybe you have something else that's going on in your life.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.200]   So that's why we need to talk about it early.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.120]   - I can imagine having to support a whole 'nother family,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.760]   and maybe you have in-laws, you have two parents,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.620]   maybe your parents are separated,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.080]   you have four separate households effectively.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.420]   Is it common for people to have to support their parents
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.320]   towards the end of their life?
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.320]   - The thing for you to know is that it's not uncommon.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.600]   In 2021, which is latest figures from AARP,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.520]   $600 billion of unpaid contributions for caregivers,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.080]   and that's 38 million caregivers
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.160]   providing an average of 18 hours of care per week,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.280]   which sounds kind of crazy.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.920]   - That's how much was unpaid, meaning--
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.760]   - Unpaid. - There was not
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.960]   enough money, okay.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.640]   - Not only that there's not enough money,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.720]   the bigger thing is to think that that's,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.180]   38 million people are stepping in to care for their parents,
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.120]   and they are not receiving
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.180]   any financial compensation for that.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.000]   So you are doing effectively a job for free
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.340]   in terms of caring for your parents.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.840]   And I'm not saying you shouldn't.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.280]   I mean, a lot of us would step in
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.120]   and care for our aging parents,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   but the problem is can you balance that in
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.280]   with working your job, taking care of your children,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   living your life?
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.440]   Do you have the time, the energy, and the finances
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.320]   to be able to balance all of that?
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.280]   Because for some of us,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.680]   our parents are gonna require a level of care
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.440]   that is not tenable for holding down a full-time job
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.040]   in addition to caring for our parents.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.280]   Some of our parents are going to have
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.160]   some sort of in-home aid,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.320]   or they're going to have to go into a nursing home
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   that can provide stability for them
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.500]   that we just frankly can't.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.900]   And the average cost of nursing homes
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.420]   right now in the United States is about $8,000,
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.460]   depending on what you're looking into needing.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.680]   Do your parents have that kind of money to cover that?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.780]   Do you have that kind of money to cover that?
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.420]   That's a huge sum.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.540]   - And that's monthly plus all of the other expenses,
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.900]   cable bill, and all those kinds of things, I assume.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.420]   Maybe nursing homes include your cable bill,
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.740]   but I am sure there are other costs per month
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.400]   than that one fee.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.460]   - And that most people over the age of 65,
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.420]   the majority of people will experience
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.940]   some form of disability at some point.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.060]   For some, it'll be short-term.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.500]   It could be that you had shoulder surgery
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.380]   and you needed help for six weeks afterwards.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.400]   It could be that you're going through chemotherapy
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.900]   and you need help.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.460]   Or it could be something long-term has happened
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.740]   and you no longer are physically able to do something,
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.500]   or you've just aged into a place
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.220]   where you no longer are physically able
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.680]   to handle things yourself.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.660]   - And we're talking about all of the extra costs
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.460]   that might come from medical issues or disabilities,
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.100]   but there's also just the cost to live.
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.820]   If your parents haven't saved enough for retirement,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.700]   just rent, food, bills, that kind of stuff,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.580]   someone is going to have to pay them.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.900]   And if there's not a plan in place,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.340]   I guess any child could say no,
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.780]   but I imagine the common answer is to try to help out,
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.020]   given your parents more often than not
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.540]   were the ones that helped you out for so many years.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.260]   So it sounds like you're probably gonna take on that burden.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.180]   Are there programs, if you find out your parents
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.760]   don't have any money, that can help them out?
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.600]   - There can be.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.580]   A lot of this varies.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.980]   Speaking specifically to the United States varies by state.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.580]   There is Medicaid that might be able to step in,
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.220]   particularly if you're looking at needing some sort of aid
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.720]   or a long-term health aid
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.700]   or moving into a nursing home, perhaps.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.600]   But that also means that they have more or less exhausted
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.180]   all of their own financial resources first.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.900]   So they have to be in a very specific position
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.140]   in order to even be eligible for that.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.620]   And there are a lot of people,
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.820]   especially if your parents have any sort of pension plan,
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.420]   which our parents might be kind of the last cohort
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.540]   that had access to a pension,
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.920]   that pension might not really be enough for them
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.360]   to live on month to month,
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.620]   but might be just too much for them to qualify for Medicaid.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.300]   So that's the other part of this that gets very tricky
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.060]   is they might have just enough to be ineligible
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.200]   for the thing that would help them.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.740]   Therefore, you are also going to need to step in
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.300]   to provide some sort of support.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.700]   And you're right to also think about the fact
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.900]   that a lot of what I'm talking about right now
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.580]   is the doom and gloom and scare tactics
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.340]   of like people are gonna get sick.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.820]   People are going to physically be unable to do things.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.300]   And that is true.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.540]   But maybe your parents are in excellent health,
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.000]   both physically and mentally.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.800]   You look at your family lineage
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.060]   and people have lived well into their 90s.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.100]   And what if your parent retired at 65
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.580]   thinking that they were going to have enough?
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.620]   Maybe they, at the time, did.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.440]   Perhaps they mismanaged money a little bit.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.540]   Perhaps they hadn't diversified their investments enough
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.820]   and took too hard of a hit at a particular time,
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.940]   at a vulnerable time at the stock market.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.020]   Whatever it is, things happen.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.820]   Maybe one spouse predeceases the other
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.980]   and that person gets into a relationship
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.760]   with somebody who drains their bank account
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.900]   in a particular way.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.660]   So many things can happen that can involve
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.140]   then adult children needing to step in
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.960]   and financially support.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.500]   Often, some people, you might think
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.140]   it would be hundreds of dollars a month.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.460]   For some people, it's going to be thousands of dollars.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.300]   a month.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.420]   And you need to know whether or not
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.940]   your budget could actually support that.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.660]   And we need to be having these conversations very early.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.540]   - We're already talking about a little bit of the what to do.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.940]   So let's back up.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.660]   And first, I want to talk about
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.680]   how to even have the conversation.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.740]   But I'm curious, is there even data out there
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.700]   about how many people have had this conversation?
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.940]   How uncommon is it for people to have this conversation?
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.100]   - I don't have a solid data point.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.360]   All I can say is anecdotally,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.300]   I don't know very many people personally.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.820]   I'd be curious if you know very many people personally
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.220]   who have had this conversation.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.940]   I've had it with my parents and my in-laws.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.420]   I don't know anyone else who has, quite frankly.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.940]   - Well, hopefully everyone that's read the book has had it.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.380]   My first reaction, funny enough,
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.180]   was I read that chapter title and I was like,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.660]   should I have the conversation or should I do the episode?
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.780]   And then I was like, oh, once I do the episode,
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.700]   I could just send the episode and be like,
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.540]   hey, take a listen to this.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.460]   Tell me what you think.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.540]   I know you were saying that even if you have advice,
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.780]   even if you have a financial advisor,
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.380]   you might not be having this conversation.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.960]   It's like such a rare thing for even the people
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.220]   that you pay to help you plan to talk about.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.500]   - So that to me, I was doing research on this,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.820]   actually just about six months ago.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.820]   And I came across a survey that had done,
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.900]   MIT Age Lab had come out with this survey.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.780]   And one, tying into all the doom and gloom
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.300]   that I was bringing up in the beginning,
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.700]   it's so important because according to this survey,
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.340]   51.2% of folks who ended up providing care,
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.020]   they themselves did not financially prepare
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.380]   for the cost of caregiving.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.260]   So more than half of people just do not prepare
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.300]   for the potential financial burden.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.820]   I hate calling our parents burdens.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.100]   That's not really what I'm saying,
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.340]   but this can be a financial burden.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.020]   But the other big part is of those folks
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.260]   who did have financial advisors,
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.440]   about 41% of them never brought it up
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.780]   with the financial advisor.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.960]   Never mentioned that they needed to provide care
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.320]   for the parents, didn't talk about the fact
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.740]   that needed to be part of their financial plan.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.940]   So anyone who's listening to this,
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.580]   who is a financial advisor,
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.860]   my big push in that arena is,
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.380]   are you asking your clients,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.740]   both your aging clients with adult children
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.180]   and your younger clients who might have aging parents,
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.740]   have you talked?
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.140]   Have you shared this information with each other?
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.140]   Encouraging them to try to open up a dialogue?
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.060]   Because especially for millennial and Gen X clients,
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.640]   Gen X is in the sandwich generation.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.700]   They're already getting the squeeze
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.220]   of aging parents and raising children.
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.140]   But millennials, we're getting into our forties.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.300]   We are rapidly heading to the point of aging parents
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.220]   and young children that we're trying to raise
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.760]   and feeling the squeeze from both sides.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.660]   So if you are in the position
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.100]   that you already have a financial advisor,
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.140]   have you spoken about this potential with them?
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.220]   Is your financial plan set up
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.060]   to account for that possibility?
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.080]   - Just as you were saying this,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.140]   I was just thinking to a handful of studies
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.860]   that show that people with lots of money live paycheck
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.540]   to paycheck and that people who drive nice cars,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.580]   I've seen this as a financial planner in the past.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.420]   The lifestyle you live is not always correlated
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.460]   to the money you have.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.060]   And so one other point that makes me think
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.300]   this conversation is even more important
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.580]   is that just because your parents might be living
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.060]   like they have their whole financial lives figured out
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.340]   does not mean that they have their whole financial lives
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.220]   figured out.
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.220]   And as much as I often think of my peers
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.620]   as the ones who would be maybe spending above their means
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.300]   and kind of in our minds, we often think our parents,
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.380]   they have it all figured out, they raised us.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.080]   I would imagine that if you looked
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.420]   into the financial situation of people approaching
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.180]   or living in retirement,
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.980]   there would probably be very similar themes
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.900]   to what you see in all other demographics
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.100]   across the country of people who are spending
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.180]   more than they should or more than they can
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.540]   and maybe not managing everything properly.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.980]   - And also think about all the financial vulnerability
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.980]   points there for folks who are aging into retirement
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.980]   where perhaps your parent rated their own retirement account
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.220]   to send you to college, or perhaps you got married
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.740]   and your parents financially paid for your wedding
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.540]   or significantly contributed to it.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.580]   And are you sure that was money
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.020]   that they had discretionary spending
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.880]   or that they had saved up for it?
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.140]   Was that maybe financed on credit cards?
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.900]   Like, do you actually know that just because your parents
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.700]   wrote you a check or paid for something on a credit card,
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.620]   that was something that they could afford to do?
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.100]   And there are all these moments,
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.660]   whether it's because of social pressure
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.580]   or just because our parents love us
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.460]   and want to do nice things for us
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.260]   that they might pick up the tab on something
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.900]   that is then to their detriment in the future.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.580]   But my question becomes,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.900]   if they're rating their retirement plan for you,
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.380]   again, are you then the retirement plan in the future?
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.580]   And you have a right to know that.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.620]   - How do you have this question?
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.040]   It seems like if almost everyone doesn't know the answer,
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.820]   there's probably got to be at least a few reasons
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.580]   why our parents haven't just volunteered up
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.860]   this information one night at dinner.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.660]   "Hey, let's go through our books."
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.900]   I guess, yeah, why are we having the conversation
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.780]   and how can we have the conversation?
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.460]   - I mean, the subtitle of the book says it all,
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.620]   "Navigate Awkward Financial Conversations."
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.300]   We don't want to have the conversation
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.900]   because it feels uncomfortable.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.220]   And particularly for parents,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.780]   especially for those who are listening
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.500]   who are parents to adult children,
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.420]   I fully acknowledge that this is an incredibly
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.120]   uncomfortable thing to talk to your adult child about,
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.200]   especially if maybe there have either been
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.640]   missteps of your own or because just things happened
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.360]   and life happened and your financial situation
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.560]   aging into retirement is not what you hoped
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.320]   and wanted it to be.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.360]   And now you're having to figure out either,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.080]   do I work for maybe a decade longer than I wanted to?
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.920]   Am I physically able to keep doing that?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.840]   Or do I need to have a frank conversation with my child
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.920]   about the help that I might need at some point?
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.320]   That's an incredibly vulnerable thing
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   for a parent to talk to a child about.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.880]   And that's also why adult children,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   yes, we have a right to know some of this information,
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.800]   particularly if it's going to impact us,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.520]   but our parents are adults at the end of the day,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.760]   they can make their own decisions.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.720]   You cannot force them to take your help
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.360]   and you can't force them to open up about this,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.040]   which is why sometimes it takes a little bit
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.800]   of delicate dancing and footwork
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.520]   and context clue picking up that you need to do
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.120]   over potentially years, which all comes back
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.040]   to why I say start this conversation early
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.020]   and don't wait for the inciting incident to happen
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.660]   so that when the inciting incident does happen,
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.640]   it doesn't have to be as stressful.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.880]   The fact that if you start it early, it can be slow.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.700]   You can do this gently.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.300]   You can bring it up multiple times in different ways.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.180]   You can have multiple people deployed
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.120]   to have this conversation
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.520]   because it's incredibly important to us.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.320]   Remember, parents do not have the same relationship
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.940]   with each of their children.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.440]   So one of you might be the better point person for this talk
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.160]   or, and this might be crazy to folks, in-laws,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.440]   because if you have a healthy relationship
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.640]   with a in-law dynamic, it is quite possible
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.440]   that your mother or father-in-law
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.320]   might feel more comfortable talking to you
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.960]   than to their own children.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.480]   You're a valued member of the family.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.900]   They love you, but they didn't raise you.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.680]   And so the connection is a little bit different.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.300]   They might be willing to be vulnerable,
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.340]   but maybe it doesn't feel quite as,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.520]   whether it's embarrassing or nerve-wracking
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.960]   or what have you.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.340]   I'm in a very privileged position with my own in-laws
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.160]   that I can have very frank conversations
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.280]   around a lot of this stuff that,
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.160]   honestly, they don't really have with my husband
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.280]   or their other two children.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.920]   It mostly gets had with me.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.040]   - Wow, let's get tactical.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.400]   How do you actually broach these conversations?
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.120]   Let's say someone listening is like, you've sold me.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.880]   I need to have this conversation.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.400]   I am gonna call my parents tonight
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.920]   or I'm gonna see them next weekend or whenever.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.480]   How do I start?
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   - All right, we have a few different strategies.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.860]   So buckle up, 'cause it depends on your relationship
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.800]   and how your parents operate.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.560]   Step one, I always love the advice route.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.280]   We all know parents love to give advice.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.660]   It's like one of their number one favorite hobbies.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.680]   So going from the angle of mom and dad,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.320]   X thing is happening in my life.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.480]   What would you do?
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.940]   Sort of strategy.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.400]   So one that I use often is,
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.120]   this is a little bit for maybe the younger millennial
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.560]   or the Gen Z-er who is listening.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.080]   Perhaps you're early on in your career.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.400]   Get access to a retirement plan.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.920]   Mom, dad, I started a new job.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.960]   I have access to a 401k.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.940]   Not totally sure how to handle it.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.260]   What would you do?
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.280]   Very telling answers in something like,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.800]   oh, I never had to worry about that.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.200]   Oh, I have a pension.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.360]   Oh, I don't have one of those.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.960]   Oh, that was really overwhelming.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.520]   Or, oh, here's exactly what I did.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.000]   Here's my investment portfolio.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.740]   You might be able to get really helpful information back.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.080]   The advice asking, though, needs to be authentic to you,
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.800]   what your parents know about you, the dynamic.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.480]   Obviously, if you're 35,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.220]   you've been in the workforce for a long time,
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.300]   your parents know that you're very successful.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.080]   Trying to go the 401k route might read as like,
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.000]   hmm, this is a weird question.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.360]   They're clearly trying to get something out of me.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   So seeing about different phases
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.720]   of whether it is estate planning or caregiving.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.600]   Bringing up something like,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.640]   hey, Joe and I are thinking about having kids
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.280]   and we're realizing that we should probably have a will
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.840]   and we probably need to look at updating beneficiaries
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.360]   across our accounts.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.020]   I was just wondering, when did you guys create a will?
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.640]   When was the last time you updated it?
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.080]   Have you updated your beneficiaries?
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.440]   There's lots of follow-up question opportunities here.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.680]   But it could also be great advice.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.840]   Your parents might have a guy that they recommend
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.920]   that you actually do need.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.160]   And then it's a win for everybody.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.620]   Now you know your parents have a will or an estate plan.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.600]   So the advice strategy in a way that reads authentic to you
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.440]   and your relationship with your parents
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.640]   can be incredibly helpful.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.360]   Even if it's not the answer that you want
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.920]   or not all of the information upfront,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.780]   and it won't be, I'm gonna be honest with you,
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.920]   you're not gonna get all the information that you need
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.480]   from one advice-seeking question.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.640]   But again, the context clues here
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.120]   can give you a lot of insight
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.800]   and be something to file away for later.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.640]   The other thing on the advice front,
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.460]   maybe you're not the one
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.600]   that could go and ask the advice question,
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.000]   but a sibling could.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.840]   And then you can also be having this conversation
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.600]   with your siblings if you have them at the same time.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.720]   What do you think about mom and dad aging?
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.240]   Have you had conversations with them about that?
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.200]   I think we should start asking them some of these questions.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.980]   I think it would make more sense for you to go ask
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.520]   X, Y, Z question based on a situation
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.160]   that sibling is having in their life.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.000]   So great, somebody else can go start
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.880]   to try to get the information.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.920]   So advice, I would say step one.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.560]   - Our next partner has a product I literally use every day.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.080]   I started taking AG-1 from Athletic Greens
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.560]   because I wanted an easy way
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.520]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.440]   and optimize my immune system.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.960]   And it's been in my routine for almost a year
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.280]   because when you take one scoop of AG-1,
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.440]   you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.760]   whole food source superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.440]   to help you start your day right.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.920]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.080]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.140]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.660]   and energized for the day,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.180]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.920]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.640]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.440]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.480]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one year supply
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.360]   of immune supporting vitamin D
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.840]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.720]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.360]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.000]   to take ownership over your health
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.960]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.360]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.720]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.200]   being proactive about this year
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.880]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.560]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.720]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.040]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.560]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.160]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.600]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.200]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.040]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.760]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.000]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.920]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.040]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.200]   And best of all, you can have this transparent,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.000]   open communication with your team
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.920]   in whatever way works best for you,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.240]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.440]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.000]   Finally, my favorite story is that
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.800]   when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.280]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.120]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.000]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.880]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.480]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.360]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.800]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.320]   you can skip the wait list and get started today.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.640]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.840]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.080]   Have you heard anyone use like an aunt or an uncle
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.000]   as a tactic here?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.280]   'Cause I feel like I know some people
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.000]   whose relationships with their aunts and uncles are so good,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.480]   and then they have like a sibling relationship
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.320]   with your parents.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.120]   Is that a strategy?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.280]   - Oh, bringing in third-party players can be very effective.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.640]   So whether that's aunt and uncle,
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.560]   just make sure that you understand the family food chain
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.760]   in terms of gossip.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.080]   That's the only thing you have to be really careful about.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.560]   Like if you try to bring somebody else in
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.800]   who's in the family, how is that gonna get back?
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.920]   Is your question gonna get maybe misinterpreted or shared?
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.840]   Or you know how your family operates,
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.480]   so just really think it through.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.920]   But maybe it's not an aunt and uncle,
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.800]   maybe it is a religious figure or a community leader
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.840]   or somebody else that your parents are really comfortable
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.480]   with and close to that you could also talk to.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.360]   That's also really helpful if you're worried
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.560]   about a medical-related incident with your parents.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.840]   If you notice that maybe your parents
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.200]   seem to be forgetting things a lot lately,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.080]   you maybe want somebody to get tested,
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.600]   maybe Alzheimer's runs in your family or dementia does,
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.040]   and you're feeling like red flags
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.560]   seem to be popping up here,
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.600]   and they're not listening to you, the child,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.520]   that's also when another person
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.080]   might be the right person to step in,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.960]   particularly 'cause you can't always go to their doctor.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.480]   They have a confidentiality
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.360]   that they can't come talk to you about.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.000]   - In your book, you have the actual
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.600]   word-for-word scripts here.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.360]   We're not gonna go and read them all.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.560]   You sent me some in advance, and I'm like,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.600]   "Oh, can we make a PDF and send it to people?"
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.360]   And if we do, we'll put it in the show notes.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.440]   But you have a whole book where it's like,
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.480]   "Here's how to have this conversation."
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.680]   - Yes, the book has all the scripts, word-for-word,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.280]   many different strategies depending on the situation.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.360]   So speaking of advice, we started with that,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.400]   which is one of my personal favorites.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.960]   If you're like, "We're past that point.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.360]   "My parents know me too well.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.080]   "I can't come to them for advice."
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.840]   We are very clear on that.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.680]   It's not gonna work.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.800]   Maybe you don't have siblings,
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.000]   or maybe your siblings also totally have it together.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.120]   They can't go.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.900]   Just asking open-ended questions can be huge.
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.360]   So bringing up situations that have happened
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.760]   either to your friends, if it's not a friend,
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.960]   I don't know, TV shows, pop culture.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.200]   There are things that you can pull to.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.360]   Usually every year, a celebrity dies without a will,
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.880]   and their estate is a mess.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.600]   So even not asking a direct question of your parents,
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.400]   but saying, "So-and-so died, and it turns out
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.100]   "they did not have a will and an estate plan,
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.280]   "and the family is fighting like crazy."
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.420]   Can you imagine?
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.260]   What would you do?
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.920]   What would you think about that?
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.220]   Like just open-ended, see what they say.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.260]   Also bringing up things like,
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.840]   "Oh, my friend's dad recently passed away.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.240]   "He had been remarried.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.680]   "He had kids from both marriage.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.080]   "He had not updated a will
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.740]   "or had any sort of an estate plan,
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.720]   "and it is just a nightmare."
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.760]   And our family situation, honestly, is a little similar.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.280]   So it was making me wonder, do you have a will?
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.400]   Or it could be our family situation is different,
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.520]   but it still really just got me thinking,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.040]   do you have a will?
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.920]   And again, I'm talking estate planning,
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.320]   but it could also be caregiving, plugging that in.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.560]   - One thing I'm hearing is that
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.240]   it's probably not the best tactic to jump straight to,
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.920]   when are you gonna run out of money?
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.560]   How am I gonna support you?
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.040]   It sounds like we're trying to pick up clues first.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.320]   Is that intentional?
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   - Yeah, listen, you can be direct.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.600]   I do not have a problem with you being direct.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.960]   However, again, know your parents, know your relationship.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.800]   How are they gonna react to that?
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.920]   I mean, I don't know about you,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.120]   but if somebody came up to me, spouse, sibling, parent,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.260]   child, and was like,
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.480]   "Hey, do you think you're gonna outlive your money?"
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.960]   I don't know that I would react great
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.320]   to that type of a question.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.480]   So bringing it up in a little bit of a more nuanced way
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.240]   or hearkening to things that you have seen happen
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.840]   in your family dynamic,
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.120]   particularly if you saw your parents
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.400]   care for your aging grandparents,
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.760]   how is that not just a perfect open door
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.560]   to be able to say,
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.520]   "I saw a lot of what you had to do
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.560]   to take care of grandma at the end of her life.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.040]   And I also know that dementia runs in our family
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.160]   and that got really stressful.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.000]   And that's something that has started
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.480]   to give me a little bit of anxiety as both of us are aging."
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.880]   Like, "You don't have to throw them under the bus.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.920]   You're getting older too.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.120]   Let's be in this together."
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.880]   And then following it up with something like,
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.400]   "Have you started creating the proper paperwork
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.680]   that we would need if something were to ever happen
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.720]   just so I don't have to be guessing
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.000]   and you immediately can get cared for?"
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.720]   A lot of people,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.360]   even if they themselves have been
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.920]   through the negative experience,
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.400]   are going to assume that they'll be okay,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.040]   which is why so often people get into a position
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.400]   where the health scare happens,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.040]   where the inciting incident happens,
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.240]   and they're not prepared for it,
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.000]   even if they saw their parents went through it,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.800]   even if their siblings went through it,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.200]   because still in their mind,
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.920]   "Well, that's not gonna happen to me."
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.640]   And that puts all of us at a massive disadvantage.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.760]   - On the estate planning front,
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.840]   I think the open door that worked really well
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.720]   in both of our families
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.160]   was that we had to go do this, right?
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.400]   We have two small children.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.360]   So we went through the estate planning process.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.640]   We set up our will, our trust, our healthcare directives.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.600]   And then I just was like, "Oh, let's talk about this.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.120]   Hey, we're going through this."
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.400]   You have to make these decisions
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.520]   for anyone who hasn't done it.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.040]   It's like, how much support do you want?
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.240]   Do you wanna be on life support?
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.080]   Do you not?
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.280]   Who makes the decisions for you?
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.120]   Who doesn't?
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.440]   Even things like who's gonna manage your money
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.280]   if you're not there?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.680]   And so we kind of just shared,
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.320]   "Hey, this is what we're thinking about.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.600]   This is how we decided.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.800]   This is what we want."
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.440]   And kind of just remind everyone that it's important.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.280]   And depending on your parents' relationship,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.120]   sometimes they're like,
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   "Well, if our kids are doing this,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.280]   we can't let our kids be more prepared than we are.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.960]   So we have to do this too."
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.520]   But in my situation,
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   it didn't lead to a natural conversation about money.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.840]   It did lead to a,
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.000]   we're gonna make sure our will and our trust
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.840]   and our estate plan
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.080]   and our healthcare directors are all set up.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.400]   I still don't have a great answer
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.680]   on whether my parents will outlive their finances.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.920]   How do you keep this going?
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.080]   How do you continue that conversation?
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.680]   - One of the things that I would ask,
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.440]   again, with the open-ended question,
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.320]   is how do you see retirement looking for you?
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.360]   And just see what they think.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.400]   If you could dream your ideal day in retirement,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.240]   what does that look like?
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.520]   And the thing that's also very important
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.520]   is to bring up where they live,
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.280]   which I know sounds a bit sensitive,
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.200]   but I live in New York City.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.440]   If my parents had been born and raised in New York City
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.400]   and didn't wanna move,
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.240]   but retired with a lump sum that maybe meant
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.760]   New York was not gonna be the option for them
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.080]   for the next 20, 30 years,
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.800]   then that's a hard conversation you have to bring up about,
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.960]   I love you and I wanna make sure
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.000]   that you have the best possible life.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.440]   And I know that you love where you're from,
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.240]   but we do have to face facts
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.600]   that are you gonna be able to sustain a high quality of life
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.120]   in this high cost of living area?
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.280]   Or if you don't live there anymore
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.200]   in the high cost of living area your parents live in,
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.280]   we'd love if you came down and lived near us.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.800]   If that's true, don't offer it if it's not true.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.840]   That's the other big part of this.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.400]   Don't offer things that you don't wanna have happen.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.200]   But it is really critical
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.840]   that you give your parents the space
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.440]   to talk about what they want.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.560]   That this is not you coming in,
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.960]   taking charge, trying to parent them,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.800]   trying to sort of ram them into whatever version of life
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.400]   that you want them to live based on
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.640]   what you think they can do
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.480]   and what you could maybe do for them.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.240]   This really needs to be a dynamic conversation
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.480]   that their opinion matters
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.440]   'cause it is their life at the end of the day.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   So it is critical that they are part of the conversation.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.360]   And as long as they are able to care for themselves,
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.640]   that's where this conversation
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.360]   can get a little bit more complicated is if they can.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.080]   But if they can,
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.280]   this needs to be about them and their wishes
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.080]   and not just you and what's easiest for you.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.280]   - And it's funny 'cause I'm playing through
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.200]   these conversations in my head while we're talking
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.120]   and where they go and how they go.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.680]   And I was thinking along the lines of,
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.080]   will someone outlive their savings?
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.680]   And I went back to, in my mind,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.760]   to making financial plans for a living,
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.360]   which I've done in my past.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.440]   And I realized when you're making a financial plan
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.520]   for a millennial client,
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.040]   there's so much time
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.200]   that you don't need to get that specific
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.400]   and they're earning money.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.040]   So it's really about this saving for the future.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.600]   I imagine, and I don't know,
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.120]   but making a financial plan for someone in retirement
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.040]   needs a bit more precision, right?
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.400]   There's a little bit more exact science
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.440]   because the money is being spent
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.600]   and the income is,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   maybe it's there in the form of social security
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   and maybe it's there in the form of dividends and interest,
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.040]   but it's probably not there in the form
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.800]   of like a W-2 paycheck.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.960]   It's no longer about save a lot.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.000]   There's a lot of variability
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.800]   in how the market will grow this pot.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.320]   It's more about, is there enough?
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.480]   Am I doing the right things?
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.240]   Is it in something that matches the risk
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.560]   I'm willing to take given the amount of years
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.920]   I'm trying to make this money last?
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.000]   I don't even know if I,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.160]   without a bunch of extra research,
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.520]   would feel good at answering that question.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.600]   If my parents even said,
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.080]   "Here is exactly how much money we have."
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.240]   I don't even think I could answer that question today.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.400]   Is it enough?
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.160]   So when you see these conversations come up,
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.360]   obviously, if the number is $100 million,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.200]   it's probably enough.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.000]   If the number is zero, it's probably not enough.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.080]   And then in between, there's a lot of open questions,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.760]   but is this something that is probably worth
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.880]   bringing in a financial planner to make a financial plan
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.760]   who maybe specializes in retirement?
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.840]   Because even as a financially savvy millennial,
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.680]   I don't think I could answer that question
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.600]   in the right way without a lot of homework.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.800]   - My gosh, yes, please.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.880]   Do not take on the full responsibility
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.760]   for creating your parents' retirement plan
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.000]   unless you are a financial planner
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.960]   who has in-depth experience
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.600]   with working with this particular clientele.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.560]   And I say that because first of all,
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.640]   you don't want the liability on your conscience
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.240]   of like, "Oh no, I screwed something up.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.500]   "And now my parents do have to live off of me
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.120]   "and/or with me because I messed up."
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.640]   No shot at your ability to figure out
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.480]   your parents' retirement plan.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.760]   But getting into the previous question
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.160]   being about how we ask and me saying open-ended questions,
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.200]   I do think we can reach a point in this, again,
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.420]   progressive conversation where you do say,
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.920]   "What does your retirement look like?
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   "And if you don't wanna share a number with me,
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.400]   "you don't have to,
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.360]   "but I am curious how it's distributed to you."
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.280]   That is actually pertinent information
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.480]   potentially for you to have.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.720]   Because for some folks,
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.320]   your parents might get a lump sum distribution
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.680]   at some point.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   And that to me is very scary.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.940]   Because if your parents get a lump sum
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.920]   and are not entirely sure how to handle it
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.080]   and then don't hire somebody who can appropriately
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.980]   figure out how to either have it invested
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.500]   or in some sort of fixed income asset or what have you
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.020]   that's best for your parents,
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.360]   maybe they go buy a house that they shouldn't be buying.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.480]   Maybe they use it to take a big trip for the family
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.280]   that maybe they shouldn't have been doing or what have you.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.640]   'Cause to them, it's all of a sudden
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.480]   getting this huge lump sum of money,
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.800]   not necessarily thinking about the fact
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.600]   that this amount might need to last me
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.080]   for the next two decades of my life.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.440]   So asking about how the money is distributed
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.360]   instead of how much money is there,
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.220]   that could actually be very helpful information
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.800]   for you to find out and give you a lot of insight.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.120]   And then yes,
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.360]   please hire a financial planner for your parents
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.680]   or encourage them to hire one depending on the dynamic,
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.640]   depending on if they can afford one.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.580]   One resource that I would recommend,
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.060]   I love XYPN, there's a bunch of different ones,
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:16.980]   but let's be honest,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.000]   they're more for the millennial Gen X cohort.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.240]   If you wanna find somebody
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.380]   who maybe has a few more gray hairs that match your parents
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.160]   that they would feel more comfortable with,
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.320]   the CFP board has letsmakeaplan.org
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.940]   that has a filter on there
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.420]   that you can search for estate planning,
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.960]   you can search for retirement planning,
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.680]   whatever it is your parents need,
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   and you can find somebody that's a CFP vetted, all of that.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   Maybe you go to some of the meetings with them
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.440]   if they feel uncomfortable with vetting someone themselves
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.400]   or if you might feel more comfortable
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.120]   and they're willing to let you in on that process,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   that could also be really helpful.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.600]   - And for people who aren't familiar,
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   CFP is a certified financial planner.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.360]   One of the requirements is that they act as a fiduciary,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.720]   which means that they are legally bound to act
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.460]   in the best interest of their clients,
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.320]   which we've talked about this in the past,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.820]   but maybe not for a handful of months.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.480]   Many financial advisors, the majority of them,
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.160]   there's a great John Oliver segment about this,
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.320]   are not fiduciaries.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.440]   They do not have to act in someone's best interest.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.520]   They generally have to do something suitable.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.820]   So if you say, I wanna invest in the stock market,
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.240]   they can't just take your money and do something else,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.360]   but they could put you in a stock market fund
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.280]   that has a 2% fee to them.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.920]   They aren't required to weigh the cost of the fees
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.520]   and the cost of the services.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.800]   So that's one thing to keep in mind.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.100]   I think anytime someone's seeking financial advice,
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.920]   I am a big fan of fiduciary-bound financial advice
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.400]   and certified financial planners offer that.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.360]   The other big thing is that so often we conflate this,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.120]   I have a financial advisor, they're managing my money.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.360]   One of the things that many financial planners do
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.520]   is prepare financial plans.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.320]   And that can be a one-time service
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.420]   that does not require managing someone's finances
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.740]   on an ongoing basis.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.920]   I know that many of our parents have a financial advisor
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.160]   managing their money, presenting it not as,
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.660]   you should talk to another person,
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.380]   but maybe you should get a financial plan,
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.440]   which might be a service that your financial advisor
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.440]   doesn't provide.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.600]   Let's get a fiduciary to come in and make a one-time plan.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.000]   And then the other thing that just came to mind
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.680]   as we were talking is,
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.240]   if you look at the expected return
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.040]   of a lot of investment portfolios,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.880]   when you're young,
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.920]   they're really heavily weighted with the stock market,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.160]   which has a higher expected return.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.500]   As you get older, you reduce the risk of that portfolio,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.200]   which inherently reduces the expected return.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.540]   So that if your parents have had a financial advisor
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.360]   for many years, paying them 1%,
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.640]   with an expectation of earning seven,
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.280]   one seventh of their portfolio is going to fees.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.240]   But if now as they're getting older and older,
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.720]   that's coming down to maybe they're
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.400]   in such a low risk portfolio that they're expecting
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.120]   three or 4%, well now 25 to 30% of their portfolio
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.040]   could be going to fees.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.040]   So I think as you reduce the risk of your portfolio,
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.800]   fees can come into play as an important factor.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.000]   You have to be pretty far along in the conversation
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.280]   with your parents to be talking about
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.760]   their financial advisor's fees.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.160]   - But to tag in on this too,
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.040]   the other thing that if your parents,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.000]   for whatever reason, would like to handle it themselves,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.480]   don't necessarily want you involved with the finding
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   or the meeting or what have you.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.360]   In addition to all of that, I would also bring up to them,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.760]   how does this person get paid?
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.040]   And obviously fees, assets under management could be one,
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.400]   but asking, does this person get a commission?
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.480]   Which is also how, but you can suss out
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.920]   the fiduciary versus suitability standard
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.880]   depending on the situation.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.720]   Are they fee based?
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.960]   Are they fee only?
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.080]   This can also give you a lot of insight.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.380]   Not making a statement one way or the other,
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.800]   but just saying fee only tends to be the cleanest,
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.120]   easiest relationship dynamic as well.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.040]   So making sure that your parents
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.360]   have all the information on how to vet somebody,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.040]   share the John Oliver clip with them.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.500]   Share the things that you're finding.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.400]   Share the articles that you're reading.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.640]   That's the other part of this,
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.600]   is that maybe they're not hearing it from you,
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.400]   but they will hear it from someone else
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.520]   and you'll just find the thing
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.800]   that will connect for them at some point.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.480]   - So we've walked through this process.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.680]   Here's why it's important.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.160]   Here's how to start the conversation.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.800]   Here's some things to think about.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   Let's say you've gotten your parents through that
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.680]   and it's not looking great.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.440]   Are there things that you would recommend?
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.460]   I was thinking off the top of my head.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.940]   It's like, okay, maybe you could travel less.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.480]   Do you start helping them budget?
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.640]   What do you kind of recommend if you are in that state
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.560]   where you're like, I'm probably gonna have to come in
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.200]   and help at some point.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.240]   Do you just accept that's gonna happen and save for it?
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.120]   Or do you try to course correct
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.080]   to potentially make their savings last longer?
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.300]   - I mean, you might've heard me deep sigh
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.680]   on the word budget on Mike,
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.320]   because I mean, yeah, that's a great option.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.360]   If your parents will accept that level of help
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.160]   for you to come in and try to help overhaul
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.520]   their month-to-month financial plan and spending
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.200]   and maybe getting them on a debt repayment strategy,
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.400]   depending on what the overall situation is, wonderful.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.320]   I know a lot of parents that are gonna be really resistant
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.680]   to letting their adult child do that.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.440]   And it's one thing you can offer.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.880]   Or again, if they're not taking the help from you,
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   sharing the podcast, sharing the books,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.620]   sharing the YouTube videos,
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.240]   whatever it is that you think might personally connect
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.800]   with them and might make them feel encouraged
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.960]   to be able to take the control.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.920]   But it is a conversation that needs to be had
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.880]   that if they've shifted from earning income
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.900]   to now having to live off of their assets,
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.080]   their lifestyle probably needs to pivot a little bit.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.560]   And what does that look like?
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.960]   And how do they feel about that?
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.840]   And is it little things day-to-day
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.360]   or is it a really big thing?
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.160]   Like the house needs to get downsized
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.680]   because that's a huge expense.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.600]   And maybe all of a sudden
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.080]   we don't need to be paying for that much house.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.240]   There might be pushback of like,
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.720]   oh, but grandkids come over
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.480]   and you come to visit or whatever.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.320]   And you can be like, you need to take the us out of it
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   and we need to be doing what's best for you.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.040]   Again, if they're completely resistant
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.200]   to you getting that level of involved,
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.520]   and yeah, you can probably take back control to a degree
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.980]   in the sense of talking to your siblings, if you have them,
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.100]   about what feels fair and equitable amongst you
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.840]   about how to handle this.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.060]   Is somebody gonna be financially contributing
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.900]   a little bit more,
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.220]   but the other person is perhaps more boots on the ground
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.480]   to be able to handle day-to-day stuff with mom and dad
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.120]   when they're gonna need help?
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.520]   Is it that you're setting aside an emergency savings fund
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.360]   that years in advance of a problem,
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.840]   all of you start contributing to
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.140]   so that there has been money set aside
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.280]   in order to be able to support your parents.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.520]   Is it that you just put into your financial plan
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.200]   and earmark an amount of money that is being set aside
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.400]   to care for your parents or to, at some point,
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.880]   buy a home that you can move them into with you
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.380]   if you need to?
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.440]   There are so many different options
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.600]   and also cultural expectations play a huge factor
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.200]   in this conversation.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.240]   For some people listening to this, this far in,
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.840]   they're like, I don't know why we're talking about this way.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.280]   My parents obviously know I'm gonna take care of them.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.880]   That's how we do things.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.720]   And for some people, that's true.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.780]   And for others, it's not.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.380]   Also, who did you marry and what do their parents expect?
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.800]   Have to be another fun part of this conversation as well.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.240]   - You mentioned send them different things,
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.300]   whether it's this podcast or a YouTube episode.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.320]   So let's pretend you sent them this episode.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.880]   I'm now speaking to the parents of the average listener
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.400]   or the listener who is a parent with adult children.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.360]   What advice would you give them
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.240]   to how they can make this situation better
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.000]   for their children and their family?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.520]   - You might be the parent who's like,
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.200]   I wish I could get my adult child
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.080]   to engage in this conversation.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.840]   They will not talk to me about these things
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.200]   'cause they don't like to think about
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.940]   me being in a situation that's tough
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.400]   or to think about me dying or what have you.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.560]   But first of all,
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.480]   I'm so glad you'll initiate this conversation.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.720]   That's wonderful.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   And if you're listening and you're like,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.080]   heck no, I'm not having this conversation with my child,
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.820]   my first question is why?
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.240]   What is the knee-jerk reaction that you're having
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.100]   that's making you not want to engage in this conversation?
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.800]   Is it the sense of vulnerability that it might take
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.720]   to be able to talk to your adult child about this?
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.240]   Is it maybe a sense of embarrassment
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.680]   about what the situation is?
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.520]   Or is it that you feel like there's too much money
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.840]   and you're not entirely sure you want your child
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.600]   to know that at some point
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.680]   they might inherit X amount of money?
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.380]   There's myriad reasons why parents
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.680]   might not want to have this conversation,
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.120]   but to at least lay out the information
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.440]   about this is a plan I have,
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.560]   this is what it looks like.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.400]   Also, by the way, we do have a will,
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.680]   we do have an estate plan,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.460]   we do have advanced healthcare directives.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.360]   Here's where all of that stuff is stored.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.040]   Here's the executor of my will,
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.080]   here's the person that's my power of attorney.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.720]   Pertinent information for adult children to know,
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   because to me, caregiving/especially estate planning,
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.340]   having that planned, taking care of that,
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.440]   and letting people know the actual information,
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.560]   that is such a great act of love.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.080]   It is one of the kindest things you can do for your family,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.340]   because it is incredibly important
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.420]   that in a time of intense stress and grief,
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.240]   people are also not scrambling
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.720]   to try to figure out what you would have wanted,
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.800]   or scrambling to figure out how to pay the bills,
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.860]   or whatever else it is,
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.320]   and just making sure that information is handled,
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.920]   and it's not just you and your spouse,
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.240]   'cause what happens is something happens
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.800]   to both of you at the same time.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.840]   They're like, your adult children
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.920]   are also looped in on this information.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.680]   So bringing up, we have this document, they're prepared,
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.280]   I wanna make sure that you're prepared
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.000]   if something ever happens to me.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.520]   Here is where all of this is kept,
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.880]   or here's the guy that you need to call
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.320]   in case something does happen,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.760]   who has all of the information, and don't worry about it.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.520]   It's a beautiful gift that you can give somebody.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.040]   And if there is some form of inheritance,
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.560]   and you feel uncomfortable
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.520]   talking to your adult child about it,
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.660]   I think that also could be really telling
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.880]   about everybody's relationship with money at this phase,
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.000]   and what conversations maybe should also be happening
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.240]   in order to foster better, more positive relationships
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.520]   with money, and potentially with each other,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.080]   depending on family dynamics.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.540]   - One thing that you just said that made me think about is,
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.100]   if you're uncomfortable talking about this
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.240]   with your children because there's too much money,
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.420]   and you're not ready to tell them about that,
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.720]   at a minimum, you could say, hey,
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.840]   I just wanna let you know we've done a financial plan,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.640]   and we're very confident that we have enough money saved
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.280]   that we're gonna be able to cover our costs,
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.640]   we've thought through it.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.080]   You don't necessarily need to let them into the calculations,
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.780]   but at least letting them know where it is
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.640]   so they're not worried could be a thing.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.020]   So that was just one thing.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.720]   Also, if you are having interesting thoughts
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.840]   about that conversation,
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.520]   I did an episode with Bill Perkins.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.000]   He wrote a book called "Die With Zero",
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.240]   and it changed my perspective on inheritance.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.320]   Not that I'm even at a point where my children
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.720]   are old enough to even spend money,
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.880]   but he kind of had this idea where he said,
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.200]   my goal is to die with zero,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.400]   and a lot of the criticism he had
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.640]   was that if you die with zero,
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.720]   you don't leave anything to any future generations.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.880]   And his answer was, no,
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.020]   but if I'm gonna leave money to my future generations,
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.340]   I wanna do it while I'm alive.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.560]   I wanna see what it can bring to their lives,
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.040]   what things they can do with it,
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.880]   the education it might provide, et cetera.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.240]   So if you're struggling with how to think about that,
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.720]   there's a couple interesting lessons from that episode
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.320]   that hopefully one day I get to use.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.500]   - I would also bring up,
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:20.600]   in addition to we're set for X, Y, Z reasons,
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.640]   bringing up any sort of proper planning you've done,
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.960]   such as we have life insurance policies,
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.900]   here's where they are,
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.680]   here's how to make sure the bills keep getting paid
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.940]   in case something happens to me
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.360]   and I end up in the hospital and it's not on auto pay,
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.400]   and then my spouse is cared for,
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.820]   or you guys need to know
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.200]   that there's this life insurance policy,
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.560]   or we bought a long-term care insurance policy.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.760]   Again, also going back to the way that adult children
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.880]   who perhaps have parents
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.720]   who are not in a financially stable situation,
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.760]   depending on the age of your parents
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.720]   and longevity prospects,
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.120]   looking into a long-term care insurance policy
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.840]   if they're not quite what they used to be.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.560]   So looking in to see whether it makes sense financially,
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.240]   whether you'd rather just be putting that money
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.820]   into an investment yourself,
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.120]   whether a hybrid life insurance policy
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.520]   and long-term care insurance policy works for you.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.340]   Again, this is a great opportunity
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.960]   to talk to a professional who has all the knowledge
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.120]   and all of the information
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.280]   and can look at the specifics
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.680]   of your and your parents' situation.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.520]   But just knowing too that there are strategies
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.920]   beyond how can I just save and scrimp my way
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.060]   to making this successful for my parents and vice versa.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.460]   - Do you ever wanna learn how to do something,
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.720]   but wanna make sure you're learning from the best?
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.960]   Like when I wanted to level up my barbecue game?
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.800]   Well, for that, I took Aaron Franklin's
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.200]   Texas-style barbecue class on MasterClass,
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.400]   which was amazing.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.940]   I've learned so much from the classes
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.160]   I've taken on MasterClass,
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.800]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.780]   With MasterClass, you can learn from the world's best minds
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.920]   anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.160]   You can learn songwriting from John Legend,
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.480]   improve your cooking skills from Gordon Ramsay,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.640]   or learn entrepreneurship from none other
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.280]   than Richard Branson.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.880]   With over 180 classes
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.560]   from a range of world-class instructors,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.280]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.960]   is closer than you think.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.040]   And with every class I've taken,
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.100]   I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.160]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.040]   I highly recommend you check it out,
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.000]   get unlimited access to every class,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.640]   and as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.320]   you get 15% off an annual membership.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.180]   Go to allthehacks.com/masterclass now.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.720]   That's allthehacks.com/masterclass
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.980]   for 15% off MasterClass.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.880]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.280]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.160]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.320]   for a good hang.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.400]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.340]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.280]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.240]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.000]   take care of the supplies.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.820]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.680]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.080]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.060]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.540]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.600]   that you got through another week.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.720]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.240]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.040]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.120]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.360]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.320]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.360]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.200]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.280]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.900]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.380]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.040]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.320]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.320]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.560]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.640]   I just wanna thank you quick
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.940]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.780]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.000]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:10.920]   So I've been trying to take notes.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.760]   I'm gonna try to recap all the things.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   Beneficiaries on accounts, important.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.320]   Setting up a will, setting up a power of attorney
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.080]   or a healthcare proxy, healthcare directives,
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.200]   all of which are common components of an estate plan.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.440]   Anyone listening knows that I used a product
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.560]   called Trust & Will to set up our estate plan for our family.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.820]   If you've listened in the last few weeks,
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.000]   you know that All The Hacks members
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.360]   get 50% off Trust & Will, which is pretty cool.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.120]   Thank you, Cody, the CEO, if you're listening,
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.880]   for offering that to members.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.480]   But your parents might be more comfortable
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.440]   with someone in person,
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.560]   and there's plenty of estate planning attorneys
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.240]   they can talk to.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.100]   Insurance coverage, especially long-term care insurance,
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:47.960]   whether that's there,
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.600]   any other types of insurance policies or life insurance.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.120]   Not just all of those things,
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.920]   but when they've last been updated.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.680]   Usernames, passwords.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.400]   I'm a big fan of 1Password.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.680]   I went through what I'll call a medium painful process
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.640]   one holiday of getting my parents all set up
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.040]   and moving every single password they had
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.680]   in their head, in their notebooks.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.580]   Maybe it was just they had one password
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.060]   and I switched it, or I helped them go
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.460]   and create new passwords on lots of different services
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.100]   so that they were less vulnerable to someone
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.040]   learning one password and getting access to everything.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.900]   - Also, where it is.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.020]   - Yeah, is it in a safe?
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.540]   Does it have a combo?
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.860]   - Where's all of it stored?
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.220]   Let's be honest, it's great if our parents
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:33.760]   are using a digital storage option for passwords.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.300]   How many of them have it written down
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.940]   on a piece of paper somewhere in the house?
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.260]   Where is that piece of paper in the house?
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.380]   That is very critical for you to know.
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.620]   I will also say, and I gotta be honest,
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.900]   my dad might be listening to this,
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.220]   so I'll be careful about exactly what I share,
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:52.700]   but I was in the incredibly fortunate situation
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.340]   that my parents sat down with me.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.100]   There was a full list of all the assets
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.380]   where everything was, who I would need to talk to.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.180]   My sister and I, for well over a decade,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.340]   have had basically a call sheet, I would call it,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.780]   about if this happens to this person,
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.340]   then this is the triggering situation.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.460]   If this happens to this person,
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.340]   then this is the triggering situation.
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.980]   Here's who you call if this happens to this person.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.420]   The peace of mind that provides,
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.600]   and is it hard to think about a situation
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.660]   where my parents either are incapacitated
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.860]   or no longer with us?
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:26.180]   Yeah, it's painful.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.500]   I don't enjoy that part of it,
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.620]   but the fact that I know exactly how
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.460]   to very painlessly settle in a state
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.700]   and a time where I'm already gonna be in a lot of pain,
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.400]   again, greatest act of love.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.220]   It is such a kind thing to do.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.500]   And I know not everyone's parents is gonna write out the list
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.300]   and slide it across the dining room table
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.940]   and have a three hour long conversation about everything
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.900]   and have a basically org chart about the flow
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.740]   of where everything is and who to call
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.260]   and who to get in touch with.
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.940]   But if you're a parent and listening, please do it.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:00.140]   It is so kind and so wonderful.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.620]   And on the flip side, on the other side of my family,
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.740]   two months ago, my mother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.300]   and she's fine now, thank goodness,
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.420]   but pre-surgery, I had to be the one that was like,
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.300]   do we have a will?
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.400]   Do we have an upstated power of attorney,
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.260]   advanced healthcare directives?
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.280]   Does your husband know how to log into all the bank accounts
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.300]   and pay the bills?
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.900]   And did I get some elbows from my husband
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:26.300]   about bringing this up moments after we started
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.860]   having this intimate conversation about cancer?
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.460]   Yeah, but also, it was my mother-in-law like,
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.060]   no, you're right, I have to get all of this done.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.100]   I pointed her to resources and directions
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.500]   and ways to get it handled.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.140]   But if you're not gonna ask the hard questions,
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.240]   especially in a moment of an inciting incident,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.820]   what if something had gone wrong
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.400]   and we hadn't have settled all of that?
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.660]   It would have been hugely difficult
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.140]   and painful for the family.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.740]   And thank goodness everything's okay,
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.460]   but that's not always what happens.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.100]   And that's why someone has to ask
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.900]   the awkward, uncomfortable question.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.740]   - I haven't gone through all of these.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.940]   I've gone through some of them.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.180]   I've encouraged my parents also to sign up.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.220]   There's a product that I worked with a while ago
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.900]   I still use called Trustworthy,
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.700]   which is basically a place online
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.020]   to put all of these things.
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.700]   And the thing I liked was it has a great onboarding
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.460]   where it's like, do you have your insurance documents?
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.860]   Do you have a contact for your financial advisor?
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.220]   What are your bank accounts?
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.580]   The other great thing is it doesn't actually
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.260]   get into the dollar value of accounts.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.140]   It's more about where are they
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:28.800]   and who do I contact and not how much is in there.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.980]   So Trustworthy is another option.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.780]   I think the discount they gave is still good
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.580]   at allthehacks.com/trustworthy if anyone's interested.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.900]   I love that product.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.100]   There's plenty of options.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.780]   Just finding something that can help organize this
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.860]   and make it easy offline, online, in a safe,
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.740]   just get the access.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.300]   I feel like we went through the flow.
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.860]   You have the conversation.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.140]   Why do we have the conversation?
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:51.980]   How do we do it?
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.940]   What's the important stuff to do?
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.980]   The good news is once all of this is gone,
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.220]   there's a little bit of relief.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.580]   You could just not worry about any of these things
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.900]   and just be in the moment.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.300]   Talk about the health situation, be supportive,
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.540]   not be stressed out about all the other components.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.620]   And if you're a parent or the parent of adult children
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.780]   or small children,
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.340]   these are all really important things still.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:15.140]   My two-year-old and nine-month-old does not need to know
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.620]   how to access the bank account, but someone does.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.740]   Because were something to happen to my wife and I,
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.400]   someone needs to be able to figure it out.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.020]   So for us, we've identified who that person is.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.700]   We've gone in on Trustworthy and said,
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.900]   "Hey, if something happens, let this person have access."
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:32.100]   We've put our 1Password emergency kit in a folder
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.300]   in an estate plan in a safe in our house,
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.900]   and they know the combination to that safe.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.460]   So we've tried to do these things already.
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.700]   Anyone could have a health problem at any time,
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.100]   but it doesn't feel like we're approaching
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.140]   end of life right now, but we're still prepared.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.700]   And it just gives us a lot of peace of mind.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.820]   And it's not that hard creating your estate plan,
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.060]   your will, like you can do it in hours.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.020]   If anything, the hardest thing is figuring out
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:58.140]   who to name as the caregivers and the trustees.
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.300]   That kind of stuff is harder.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.860]   But actually just putting the docs together
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.820]   and signing them was actually the easy part.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.860]   - Well, and that's also why checking in on this information
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.340]   and making that a practice to do every couple of years,
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.620]   particularly if you have young children,
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:16.860]   because the named guardian very easily could shift
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.040]   over a couple of year period.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.540]   So making sure that is always up to date and accurate,
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.100]   really no matter your age, is incredibly important.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.100]   And also, I know some people will think
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.740]   that this is a little bit bonkers,
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.100]   but sometimes it gets brought up like age appropriate ways
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:33.340]   to talk about this with kids.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.080]   And like, listen, if you have adult children
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.500]   who are fully into their like 20s, 30s, 40s,
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.220]   like, yeah, let's have this conversation.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.700]   When I was 10 was the first time
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.860]   that I had any sort of version of this conversation,
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.780]   which might sound crazy, but hear me out.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:52.700]   We were living in Japan at the time
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:56.100]   and obviously not near any of my family.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.020]   So it was my parents, me and my little sister,
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.340]   we're the only family around,
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.080]   and my parents were traveling together
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.660]   and my sister and I were staying behind.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.140]   Now we were obviously being left with a guardian,
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:09.980]   but my mom said right before they left,
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.220]   "If anything were to ever happen,
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.940]   you just need to call your Uncle Kevin
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.260]   and he'll know what to do."
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.940]   I was 10, but the level of peace that gave me
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.540]   to just know like, this is the adult
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:22.200]   that I would need to contact if something were to happen.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.380]   Now, I did not know at the time that my Uncle Kevin
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.160]   is who would have been our guardian
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.260]   and we would have just been moving back to America.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.780]   That would have been the course of action
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.860]   if something happened.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.620]   I didn't know that piece, but I just knew that like,
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.460]   this is the adult who we should get in touch with
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.980]   if something ever were to happen to my parents.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:41.100]   And for me, there was a level of peace to that.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.300]   Now, all kids are different.
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.220]   Your kid might be really anxious in a way that like,
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.500]   that's not helpful information to share,
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.220]   but at least make sure to know
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:51.020]   that the person watching them knows who to call
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.420]   if something were to happen.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:55.020]   Like sharing information also on that level,
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.180]   we never wanna think about it
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.260]   because we don't wanna think about something happening to us
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.940]   but it's really important.
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.860]   - Maybe not my two-year-old,
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.380]   but our au pair should know what to do
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:04.180]   if something were to happen when we're out of town
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.620]   or my sister, for sure.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.420]   Okay, as long as we're on the topic
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.860]   of uncomfortable conversations we can have about money,
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.680]   there is another topic in the book
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.960]   that I feel like it would do justice to cover,
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.760]   maybe not as in-depth
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.700]   because it probably doesn't come up for everyone
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.740]   or many of us listening might've already gotten past it.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:22.980]   Let's talk about the conversation
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.380]   around money and your partner.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.660]   We've already covered the emotional side of it
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.420]   in my conversation with Ramit,
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:32.300]   but I haven't had any conversation on this show ever
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:36.540]   about pre-nups and post-nups and that whole can of worms.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.460]   And I know you have and have lots of opinions.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.500]   So for anyone who's either in that situation,
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.880]   will be in it, regrets not having been in it,
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.860]   what advice do you have for people to think about?
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.260]   - Man, we need to stop making the pre-nup a big deal.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.700]   That is my first and foremost soapbox on this topic
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:57.180]   is that pre-nups are one of the biggest remaining taboos,
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.220]   I feel, when it comes to money conversations
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.860]   because to just say the word, like people are like,
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.380]   cursed, how dare you get a pre-nup?
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.420]   Your marriage is gonna fail.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:11.440]   You do not trust and love your spouse if you want a pre-nup.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.980]   All right, here's my multi-prong attack
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.860]   on people who are currently listening to this
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.020]   and feeling that way.
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.580]   First and foremost, as my pre-nup attorney said to me,
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.420]   because yes, I do indeed have a pre-nup,
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.660]   is that everyone has a pre-nup,
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.700]   it's just the default laws of your state.
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:27.980]   What a great reframe.
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.900]   So technically, there is a pre-nup in place for you
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.080]   if you didn't get one yourself,
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.980]   and it's just based on how your state
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.560]   would divide assets in the case of a divorce.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.860]   All right, fair enough.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:43.100]   You should look at those state laws prior to getting married
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.100]   to see if that feels fair to you
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.900]   and the ecosystem of your relationship.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.540]   And if it doesn't, you should get a pre-nup
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:52.660]   because that'll account for what actually feels fair to you
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:54.100]   within reason.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.940]   You can't just do like anything you want in a pre-nup.
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.980]   There are rules and stipulations.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.140]   But within reason, you can take back some level of control.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.260]   The other thing is I really just think of it
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.480]   as marital insurance.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.880]   And I think of it that way because again,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.180]   a lot of times people say like, oh, if you get a pre-nup,
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:13.980]   it means that you don't love or trust your partner.
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.380]   Well, I don't have renter's insurance
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.700]   because I think that I'm gonna get burglarized.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.900]   I don't have car insurance
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.140]   because I think I'm gonna get into an accident.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:25.160]   I have those things just in case the bad thing does happen,
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.440]   then I'm protected.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.740]   I kind of think of pre-nups in a very similar way
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.460]   that it is an insurance policy on my marriage.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.460]   I didn't get married thinking,
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.060]   well, this could go sideways and we could get divorced.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.600]   I got married thinking this is my person forever,
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.040]   but life is long.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.780]   And if something happens
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.340]   and we're no longer happy being married,
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.700]   then I have an insurance policy
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.220]   that will make it much easier to get divorced.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.560]   And we will have made decisions
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.340]   about what feels fair and equitable
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.780]   at a point where we're very much in love
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:57.020]   and we'll have been kind to each other.
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.500]   And it will save so much money on the cost of a divorce.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.340]   Divorce can be so expensive.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.000]   And also no one talks about that part.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.060]   And then finally, for those of you listening
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.540]   who are thinking, well, I just never leave my spouse.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.620]   Listen, people think that for myriad reasons.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:15.220]   It could be religiously, societal pressure,
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.500]   cultural pressure, personal feelings.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.800]   You just would never leave this person
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.600]   no matter what happened.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.060]   Well, you can't control what they will do.
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.620]   They could leave you.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.620]   And that's always really hard to hear.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:30.020]   But again, to have a document in place
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:34.220]   that stipulates what feels fair to you is important.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.460]   Because finally, everyone listening here
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:42.460]   would not sign a contract or a business agreement
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.440]   or anything in the business realm.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.000]   You would never join a partnership with a friend
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.460]   without having a contract about what feels fair
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.800]   and deciding what would also happen
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.580]   if things were to go south.
[00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.040]   Why are we all signing this very legally binding agreement
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.160]   that has huge financial implications
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.880]   without reading the fine print?
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.960]   And that is one thing too
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.400]   that I think about a marriage license
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.680]   is that's one of the biggest financial decisions
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.640]   you might ever make in your life.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.160]   Why are we not knowing the terms and conditions
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   prior to signing?
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.360]   - One thing that never crossed my mind
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.240]   with what you just said was that
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.960]   I have at least a few friends now
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.260]   that have gone through the process of divorce.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:26.120]   And even when amicable, it is very expensive.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.860]   And I've always just put prenups in the light of
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.520]   this is a thing to make sure that you protect money
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.280]   in a situation where one person has more
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.640]   or might have more or something like that.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   That's the idea.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.760]   But is there a world where someone could say,
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.240]   look, I believe that if we ever get divorced,
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.080]   we should split everything 50/50,
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.960]   but we should still have a prenup so that if it happens,
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.840]   it just is a simple process.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.520]   In the way that an estate plan might avoid
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.520]   the messy process of probate,
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.840]   you could decide how things get affected.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.920]   Could a prenup just be something that adheres
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.520]   to the same process as what you'd thought
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.640]   what the state would do, but just does it more efficiently
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.960]   and saves you on attorney fees?
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.400]   - I would talk to an attorney about that
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.280]   before I'm gonna be like, yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.940]   'Cause again, so much varies by state.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.960]   If you live in a community property state,
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.640]   your divorce might actually be easier
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.000]   if you're not gonna contest anything,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.680]   'cause they're usually just like 50/50 down the middle,
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.920]   let's go, it doesn't matter why.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.960]   So again, knowing the laws of the land
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.000]   could impact whether or not you need one
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.920]   in the first place, if it feels super fair,
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.240]   and you also can see a world where you can get
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.360]   through a divorce quick and easy
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.720]   with like minimal amount of pain and suffering financially.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.240]   'Cause if that stuff drags out, it is so expensive.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.000]   But the other part, I sometimes feel like
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.760]   it's a bit of a misconception that a prenup
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.520]   is just to protect the one person
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.080]   who brings in all of the assets.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.520]   Yes, obviously, if you come from wealth
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.200]   or you've already created wealth,
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.800]   those are two key reasons that you would want a prenup.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.600]   A third being if you have a child
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.840]   from a preexisting relationship,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.520]   that's another good reason to have a prenup,
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.080]   to protect the financial interests of your child.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.880]   But it also can be about what would happen
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.720]   to, let's say, retirement accounts.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.240]   Those are often forgotten about in these conversations.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.320]   So even if you haven't accumulated
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.360]   a bunch of assets going in,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.680]   if you have one that you know has the potential
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.080]   to get pretty significant over, let's say,
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.860]   10, 15, 20 years of a marriage,
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.660]   those are often some of the first assets
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.320]   to get completely gouged in a divorce.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.280]   So even just having a prenup that might be as simple as,
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   we're protecting our retirement accounts,
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.640]   we each just have the right to our own retirement account,
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.840]   we don't have rights to each other,
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.420]   that might be something that saves you
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.940]   a ton of money in the future.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.520]   Now, a prenup isn't cheap.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.880]   I look at it as an upfront lump sum on an insurance policy.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.360]   So again, that amount of money might not feel good to you
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.560]   for doing something just like
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.240]   exclusively protecting a retirement plan.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.760]   But if we wanna talk postnups,
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.280]   this also might be an opportunity
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.440]   to bring that up with a spouse.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.540]   And postnups are a really hard sell
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.800]   if you have not previously had the prenup conversation.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.560]   I actually know a couple of people
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.080]   who wanted to have a prenup,
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.280]   just kind of ran the clock down on getting it done,
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.880]   and then got married and had a postnup instead.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.840]   That's an easier pitch.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.820]   If you're 10, 15 years into your marriage,
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:28.660]   and all of a sudden you're like,
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.160]   "Oh, postnup sounds like a great plan."
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   And you pitch that to your spouse,
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.160]   it might sound like you're preparing to divorce them.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.000]   So it's a much harder sell to be like,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.120]   "Let's have a postnuptial agreement."
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.000]   - But I guess conceptually,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.840]   you can make these changes at any point in time,
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.680]   it sounds like.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.480]   It doesn't have to be done before marriage.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.320]   - You can.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.640]   And honestly, a lot of prenups should, again,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.620]   like all the documents we've been talking about already,
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.760]   you should check in on that from time to time,
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.800]   just in the sense of,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.960]   has something big shifted in your marriage?
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.520]   So if you had outlined something in the prenup
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.120]   that now no longer feels fair,
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.840]   based on the current ecosystem of your relationship,
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.640]   it might be time for a postnup.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.080]   And that could be something like,
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.720]   "Hey, if the two of you waived alimony in your prenup,
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.560]   "but you're 10 years in, you've had two kids,
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.120]   "and one of you has left the workforce
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.680]   "for an extended period of time,
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.460]   "that doesn't feel so fair anymore
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.560]   "that you waived alimony in the prenup."
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.640]   So it might warrant having a postnup to compensate for that.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.240]   Or maybe you had kids,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.000]   and now you feel like the finances
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.080]   are a little bit of a different conversation.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.160]   Or maybe somebody, Bill Perkins style,
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.600]   received a lump sum inheritance early,
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.000]   and you bought property with it,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.440]   and you wanna have a postnup that accounts for
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.000]   who has rights to that property in the case of a divorce.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.380]   - I know some people whose parents have asked
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.920]   to set up a postnup pre-inheritance,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.600]   but a situation that you just alluded to
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.640]   that I thought was something that
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.440]   I'd never really thought about a prenup in this perspective
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.400]   was one of the spouses was going to leave the workforce
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.320]   to take care of kids full-time,
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.520]   and that would, in the future,
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.720]   kind of hinder their ability to earn income.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.080]   They'd be out of the workforce maybe five, 10 years.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   They would be out of their career track.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.980]   At that point in time, they actually talked about,
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.760]   "Can we set up something different?
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.160]   "Because my ability, were we to get divorced,
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.120]   "to go get a job is different going forward than it is now."
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.200]   So that was a point in time where someone brought that up,
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.320]   where it felt a little more natural
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.820]   than just out of the blue.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:25.000]   I haven't thought or done any of this stuff,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.360]   it just never crossed our minds,
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.680]   and now I don't even know how I'm gonna think about it.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.520]   You just threw this at me,
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.720]   like you're crazy to have not done something.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.240]   I respect your opinion, and I haven't done it,
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.980]   and I still have this weird undertone of like,
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.820]   "Why would I do it?
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.640]   "That seems crazy."
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.320]   I trust, you know, like... (laughs)
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.680]   So it's just so funny that-- - I get it.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.440]   - I'm trying to have this rational conversation,
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.340]   and those emotions, I still see them.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.600]   - Oh, listen, I have,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.000]   I'm gonna say 85% of people react to this soapbox
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.100]   that I have in that way.
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.520]   Even if they see from like a very rational side of things
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.600]   that it makes a lot of sense,
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.020]   a lot of people still feel,
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.920]   "Yeah, it's not romantic, I get it.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.640]   "There's nothing about that process that is romantic."
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.920]   But even if you're not gonna sign on the dotted line,
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.200]   to have the conversations that are required of you
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.280]   when going through the prenup process,
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.680]   that is some of the best pre-marriage conversations
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.600]   that I could ever recommend somebody having.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.520]   And even if you're not going to get married,
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.840]   but if you're in a long-term committed relationship,
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:28.560]   it is such helpful conversation to be having,
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.920]   'cause it really digs into
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.240]   not only how each of you react to money,
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.200]   and let me tell you,
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.720]   you'll be surprised what triggers you
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.960]   during the prenup process.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.800]   And you might be like,
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.440]   "Wow, I did not expect to react that way to something."
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.560]   But you will.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.800]   And it also gets into how each of you
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.900]   personally feels about money,
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.560]   how you wanna handle money in a marriage,
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.880]   what feels fair to you,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.320]   and then, yeah, if certain things come up,
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.720]   what feels fair to you at that time.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   And again, that's gonna be an evolving conversation.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.720]   What felt fair six years ago
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.340]   when my husband and I were working on this
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.800]   probably feels a little different than right now
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.720]   at this phase in our relationship and marriage.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.440]   - So I just binged part of Ramit's show,
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.720]   and I've listened to his podcast.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.720]   It still amazes me,
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.320]   just given the way that my wife and I manage our finances,
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.880]   that there are couples where you can get married
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.200]   and find out later that one spouse has a lot of debt,
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.400]   and the other one doesn't.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.280]   It seems crazy that you could sign a contract
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.040]   that would require you to be equally liable
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.040]   for a financial situation in some ways
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.560]   without actually understanding that situation
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.880]   before going in.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.380]   I know you have a few things to say here,
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.960]   so I'm just gonna leave that as an open door
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.120]   when it comes to if either spouse has student loans
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.960]   or credit card debt or anything like that.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.680]   Does that play into this situation and change anything?
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.640]   - It should.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.760]   If your spouse has debt, first of all,
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.040]   again, know the rules of your state.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.520]   Is there any possibility for you to become
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.920]   legally obligated to that debt
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.080]   as a byproduct of getting married?
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.280]   Oftentimes the answer is no,
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.240]   unless you accumulated it together in the marriage,
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.240]   or they accumulated it unbeknownst to you in the marriage,
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.640]   it still could impact you,
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.480]   so that's an important thing to know.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.280]   But student loans obviously being a big thing
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.960]   for millennials, outside of you co-signing on it,
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.100]   typically you are not legally connected to that debt
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.520]   in the case of a divorce.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.480]   Now, what happens if you get married
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.000]   and you graciously, aggressively help your spouse
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.240]   pay off the student loans,
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.120]   and then your marriage goes down the tubes
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.480]   a year or two later?
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.280]   I've seen this on Reddit a few times.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.020]   (laughs)
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.440]   And all of a sudden, you had paid tens of thousands of
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.400]   dollars to help your spouse get out of debt,
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   and they're like, "Okay, I'm out."
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.560]   A prenup actually could solve for that problem.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.320]   There's all sorts of different strategies
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.240]   that you could put in,
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.880]   but you could have kind of like a vesting period
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.120]   for what they would owe you back
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.080]   if you came in and paid off a huge amount of their debt,
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.500]   and then the marriage dissolved in a certain period of time.
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.540]   Again, is that a romantic thing to be talking about
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.880]   when you're planning your wedding?
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.600]   Absolutely not.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.160]   Does it sometimes sound like you don't trust your partner?
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.360]   It might, but that is an important conversation
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.820]   to be having, 'cause again,
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.680]   you just don't know what could happen.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.880]   And particularly if you have worked very hard
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.400]   to set up a solid financial life for yourself,
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.320]   you don't want something like a divorce
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.600]   to completely undo all of that work.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.120]   But it sounds like even if you're four or five years
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:28.960]   into a marriage and you're like,
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.520]   let's use our savings to pay off your student loans,
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.760]   that could be a time where you say,
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.380]   could we set up a very specific post-nup for this situation?
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.100]   The thing that I never really considered is like,
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.120]   it doesn't necessarily have to change
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.280]   some of the default state rules.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.720]   You can get a post-nup, I assume, that says,
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.880]   "Hey, you're gonna have to pay back the student loans,"
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.180]   but we still split all of our assets.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.720]   You don't have to rewrite everything
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.160]   and kind of do it in a way that's like protecting your money
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.800]   and make sure no one ever gets any.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.080]   It doesn't have to have all those stipulations.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.560]   And it doesn't need to be adversarial, truly, at any point.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.720]   The one beauty I see of doing it at what hopefully
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.880]   is sort of like a peak time of your love bubble
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.680]   when you're engaged and you're getting excited
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.980]   to be married and start this life together,
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.560]   that you will be kind and fair and generous with each other,
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.080]   'cause there's a reason you're marrying this person.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.440]   And also, depending on work situations,
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.000]   that person might have helped you
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.160]   get where you are financially.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.600]   Like, I know a lot of my career is owed to my husband
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.900]   handling a lot of things behind the scenes
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:33.360]   and being supportive and doing a lot for my household, too.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.240]   So, yeah, he deserves some of the money.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.400]   - So, there are a handful of things that we didn't get to.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.840]   We're pretty far into this.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.460]   I'm gonna maybe ask you some questions.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.320]   We could treat it more like a rapid fire,
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.360]   and you're welcome to get on your two-minute soapbox
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.000]   and share your thoughts.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.400]   While we're still on the topic of money and other people
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.720]   and taboo subjects, talking about money with friends,
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.520]   sharing information about your finances,
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.320]   you have a perspective that I would say maybe is contrarian.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.360]   Can you share?
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.200]   - Yeah, I think you should.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.240]   That's contrarian.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.960]   Most people don't wanna share the information.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.880]   You don't have to share numbers.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.120]   But if you are dealing with paying off a big sum of debt,
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.720]   or if it's a positive thing,
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.760]   like you're trying to save up for a down payment,
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.640]   or you guys are gonna have a kid, or whatever it is,
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.680]   it's helpful to give your friends context
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.360]   about why you might be opting out of a social engagement,
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.440]   especially if you keep saying no.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.720]   And I really say this one
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.440]   from a place of personal experience,
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.740]   where if you say no enough times, people stop asking.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.440]   We're also all pretty self-centered creatures
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.280]   at the end of the day,
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.600]   so if you keep saying no with absolutely no context,
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.520]   they're gonna think it's a them thing and not a you thing,
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.280]   and that for some reason you're mad at them,
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.100]   or you're upset at them,
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.000]   or you don't wanna spend time with them.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.440]   So giving people a little bit of context about,
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.320]   hey, I gotta be honest with you.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.880]   I'm in a situation where I'm trying
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.200]   to pay off some credit card debt,
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.580]   or I'm trying to pay off my student loans,
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.800]   or we're working really hard
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.840]   to save up a down payment for a house.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.000]   And so that is just gonna kind of limit my ability
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.460]   to be able to say yes to every single concert,
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:08.280]   happy hour, birthday, dinner, insert activity here.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.040]   If you're hearing me say this and you're like,
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.960]   I'm feeling itchy, none of this sounds good, absolutely not.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.720]   The other option is always just provide an alternative,
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.760]   the old compliment sandwich routine.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.520]   I love you, wanna spend time with you.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.240]   Don't really wanna spend $50 on bottomless brunch.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.860]   How about we grab a bagel and go for a walk in the park?
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.800]   Anytime you're saying no to your friend,
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.920]   provide a counter to what you're saying no to.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.120]   So create a solution to the problem that you are causing
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.640]   by not wanting to just opt in all the time.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.400]   Okay, loaning money to friends.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.760]   You can do it, just never expect to get that money back,
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.860]   which is very common loan advice.
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.720]   But my bigger point here is I would really encourage you,
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.640]   friends, family, whomever it is,
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.840]   reframe that in your mind like a gift.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.320]   You are giving them a gift.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.080]   So first of all, don't gift them more
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.600]   than you are comfortable gifting.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.980]   And if you get paid back, delightful.
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.120]   But if you don't, and also the reason I'm saying to do this
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.800]   is because inevitably you loan somebody money
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.240]   and then they go and like book a trip or buy a new TV
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.600]   or like spend money in a way that you're like, excuse you,
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.320]   I just loaned you $300 and you haven't paid me back yet.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.440]   How dare you go spend money on this thing?
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.720]   You trying to have ownership or entitlement
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.160]   over someone else's financial life
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.240]   is just gonna be an absolute relationship deal breaker.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.480]   So if you're gonna loan money,
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.720]   no more than you can afford
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.120]   and you've reframed it as a gift.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.840]   And if you can't do that, for the love of God, say no.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.680]   Just don't loan the money.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.720]   But provide another thing.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.600]   Oh, I'm happy to help you budget.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.640]   Happy to help you do this.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.360]   What have you, but don't loan that money.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.600]   - Engagement rings?
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.280]   - You know what, I don't see the point.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.840]   It is probably the most controversial stance that I have.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.280]   I feel like don't waste money on engagement ring.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280]   Why are we doing this?
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.900]   I don't get it.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.560]   I also don't get it from like a personal aesthetic situation.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.840]   People who are seeing me, I like wear a gold band.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.740]   I do wear a wedding ring.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.720]   I did not at any point in my engagement
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.780]   wear an engagement ring.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.120]   You don't need one to propose.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.960]   My husband proposed without one.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.320]   And if it's something you genuinely want, great.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.080]   It is the byproduct of the world's best marketing strategy.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.840]   And so that's more of my thing.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.960]   Why do we do it?
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.520]   Do you actually want it?
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.640]   Or have you only been socially conditioned to want it?
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.480]   And it's okay if you actually want it.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.840]   But do you really truly want it?
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.680]   And is it worth the ring?
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.520]   Or is there somewhere else that we can spend this money
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.540]   that makes more sense and is more aligned with your values?
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.620]   And again, there are folks for whom it's like,
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.760]   no, no, jewelry is my thing.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.620]   Like, I love this.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:44.480]   I can't wait to have it.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.780]   Maybe it doesn't have to be a diamond.
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.660]   Maybe it can be something else that means more.
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:49.860]   Maybe it's made in a lab, so it's a lot cheaper
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.860]   and people really can't tell the difference.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.260]   Whatever it is, but only have one
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.380]   if it really is in alignment with what you want
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:58.700]   and not because of socially
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.340]   it's what we're supposed to be doing.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:01.160]   - Love it.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.220]   Okay, we're gonna wrap.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.580]   We're way over time.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.460]   But normally I ask everyone for some fun tips
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.300]   on what to eat, what to drink, what to do,
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.900]   where they're from.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.580]   For you, I have a little bit of a different question
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.260]   because since we first talked,
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.940]   you both listened to the episode I did
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:19.520]   with Brandon on Japan, went to Japan.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.500]   So I would love any tips you have.
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.360]   Did you do any of the things he suggested?
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.200]   Were they fun?
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.260]   Were there things he missed?
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.860]   And then feel free if you want to make any suggestions
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.340]   in whatever place you know best.
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:32.320]   But rarely do I get to talk to someone
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.220]   who actually listened to a travel related episode
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.820]   and then went and did the trip.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:39.500]   - So first of all, never gonna say you missed anything.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.740]   All the advice is great.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.900]   If anything, I'm really mad I didn't get to it.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:45.780]   Like I'm not kidding, three days sooner.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.060]   Because there were multiple restaurants
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.740]   that he had recommended that had gone up
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.300]   like 48 hours prior and were already sold out
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.060]   for the dates that we were gonna be in Japan.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.800]   Some of them just book that fast.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.980]   So if you listen and you're planning a trip,
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.340]   truly calendar reminder for like 45 days out
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.260]   to start planning to make some of the dinner reservations.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.860]   So that was my only bummer.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.720]   It was so helpful for strategizing my itinerary.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.540]   As I mentioned earlier, I lived in Japan as a kid.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.460]   So first of all, our itinerary was a little different
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.580]   than some people's might have been
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.900]   'cause I lived in Kobe.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:23.360]   So we wanted to spend a good chunk of time in Kobe.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.360]   People kind of overlook Kobe as a city.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.460]   So my first tip would also be like, don't overlook it.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.300]   It's a great city.
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.580]   So Kobe beef, go get it in the motherland.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.820]   The other part, I was really struggling
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.700]   about when to stay in a ryokan,
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.580]   which is a traditional Japanese hotel.
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.740]   I was like, I know I wanna have this experience.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:43.700]   I want my husband to be able to experience the onsen.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.540]   And there's a point in the podcast where he says
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.620]   that a lot of people try to shoehorn that into Kyoto.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.260]   And that is always the wrong move
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.260]   because Kyoto, you wanna be like out experiencing it,
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.220]   going to all the temples, going to the wonderful food.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.900]   There's so much to do there.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.580]   But that's antithetical to what a ryokan is
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:04.500]   'cause you wanna be relaxing in the hotel, doing the onsen.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.060]   So that really should be the dessert,
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.500]   as he described it, of the trip.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.260]   We didn't quite do it as dessert.
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.740]   It was like third course, almost dessert,
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:15.500]   but it was at a point where we had done a lot of the things.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.380]   And so it was great to be relaxing.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:20.380]   And we actually did it a little outside of Kobe in Arima.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:22.820]   A-R-I-M-A, Arima.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.860]   Wonderful town that I would highly recommend.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.940]   But that part of the episode,
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.860]   I just had this like full sense of clarity about like,
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.740]   okay, this is actually how we should schedule this trip.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.620]   So we did Tokyo to Kyoto to Kobe.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.860]   In route to Kobe, we did a half day in Osaka,
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.580]   which some people might think is sacrilege
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:46.020]   'cause you should probably spend like a full day or two.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:49.740]   And then a few days in Kobe, up to Arima for the ryokan,
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:52.740]   and then back to Tokyo where we did get to do
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.180]   a Tokyo Giants-Hanshin Tigers game,
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:57.740]   which if you're in Japan during baseball season,
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.340]   get tickets to a baseball game.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.340]   It is a sight to behold.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:03.780]   Even if you're not a baseball fan,
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.300]   one of my favorite travel things to do
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:09.220]   is to try to experience a sports and/or arts thing
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.060]   in the place where I am.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.940]   So baseball in Japan is one of the best things to do.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.020]   - That's awesome.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:16.980]   This has been great.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:19.460]   Any final tips, somewhere, someplace,
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.220]   if you've got something top of mind?
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:25.100]   - Oh, Champagne and Gyoza in Tokyo is a great restaurant.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.740]   Not talking about money, but Champagne and Gyoza
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.460]   would be my one restaurant ad
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:32.180]   that is not on the podcast previously.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:36.500]   And I would challenge everyone listening
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:39.020]   to have one awkward financial conversation
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.580]   by the end of the week, whatever week you're listening.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.420]   - I love it.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.580]   - Challenge yourself to have one uncomfortable
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.580]   money conversation with someone that will be productive.
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:49.780]   - Where can people go find scripts you've written,
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:51.540]   posts you've written, books you've written, everything?
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.340]   - So everything we've talked about
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.540]   is in "Broke Millennial Talks Money," my third book.
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.620]   You can find that wherever books are sold.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.020]   My first two, "Broke Millennial"
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.020]   and then "Broke Millennial Takes on Investing."
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.820]   And then I have a workbook, "Broke Millennial Workbook."
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.740]   Plus me, you can find on Instagram @BrokeMillennialBlog,
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.940]   on Twitter @BrokeMillennial.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.940]   Website is BrokeMillennial.com.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.580]   I don't update it a ton anymore.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.660]   So I'm gonna be honest,
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.420]   Instagram is really the place to find me.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.260]   - Awesome.
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:20.100]   You've owned the term,
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:23.300]   but I will say that the content has also evolved.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.260]   If you're listening to this and you're like,
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.780]   I'm not broke, why would I go read this book?
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:28.240]   Chapter seven inspired this episode.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.080]   There is a lot there.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.420]   I just wanna caution anyone
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:31.660]   that hears the word "Broke Millennial"
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.980]   and thinks, I don't need this book
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.380]   'cause I have some savings.
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.340]   There are still scripts in there
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.060]   that I've used for this purpose already.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.740]   - And I will also say, you might not be,
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.820]   but someone in your life probably is.
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.420]   And so they might find it helpful.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.820]   (laughing)
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:47.660]   - Awesome.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.540]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.580]   - It was wonderful to be here.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.900]   Thanks for having me.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:55.100]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.880]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.380]   If you haven't already left a rating
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:01.780]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.500]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.940]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.300]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:11.580]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:12.660]   That's it for this week.
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.860]   I'll see you next week.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.800]   (electronic beeping)
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.880]   (electronic buzzing)
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:32.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
