[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   You live within the castle walls of this maritime order
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.920]   that people follow the rules.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.120]   And then you're protected on the outside.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120]   We have military things, et cetera.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.560]   If those walls are breached by dictatorship
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.640]   or by really stupid grand strategy,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.080]   like our country's come perilously close
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   in the last few years, perilously close.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.680]   If Trump had been president at the time Ukraine was invaded,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.280]   Ukraine would be no more.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.800]   We would have Russian armies right up to the Polish border
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.880]   now.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.600]   I gave the Marshall Lecture.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200]   It was published in the Journal of Military History.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   And in it, I summarized my views on what
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.680]   the difference between a continental and maritime power.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.720]   And that's one of my big career takeaways.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.320]   It's a fundamentally different way of looking at the world.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920]   So Putin honestly looks at the world.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.840]   If I control territory, that's what makes me secure.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.400]   Maritime powers, they start with Britain, which is, hey,
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.520]   I'm secure if I can maximize money from commerce,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.480]   because then I can buy Navy and buy allies with armies
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.200]   and stuff.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.040]   And then eventually, this order of organizing trade
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.480]   by international law, and the Dutch Republic
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.240]   is instrumental in this with Hugo Grotius, who
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.280]   is the founding father of international law.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.360]   They want to run transactions by law, et cetera.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.920]   This is an international order that's win-win.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.720]   You join it.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.640]   You get security.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.000]   You have input on how it evolves,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.440]   because it's a work in progress.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.360]   Whereas this continental thing is negative sum.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.920]   And you can see it in Ukraine.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.440]   So Putin wants more territory.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.920]   OK, he's got a zone.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.680]   He took the eastern Ukraine, and he took Crimea in 2014.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.760]   But it's negative sum, because he
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.640]   destroys whatever businesses have been being run in Donbass,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   and he absolutely kills most of the tourist industry.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.200]   If you look at Europe as a peninsula,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.520]   you're better off with more insulation from Russia than not.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.560]   And Europeans, as a group, understand
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.640]   that it is absolutely in their interest
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.360]   to have an impregnable border around Ukraine.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.760]   It protects them all.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.920]   And isn't it fascinating that the Finns and the Swedes,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.040]   who forever were neutral, are now all over this?
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.600]   Europe doesn't threaten Russia.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.040]   They would love it if Russia would join the party.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.640]   Join the rules-based order.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   You'll make money.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.400]   You'll do well.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.280]   Except the oligarchs in question,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   this real minority of people who run Russia and Putin,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.800]   they personally won't do as well.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.920]   They could join the maritime order any day.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.200]   That is what, at the end of the Cold War,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.440]   everyone wanted them to do.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.200]   Everyone wanted Putin to join it.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.360]   The Russians-- if you think about all the money Putin
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.680]   has spent on his crazy military stuff,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.320]   imagine what would have happened if he'd
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.560]   spent all that on the Russian road system,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.520]   because their road system's deplorable.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.640]   And imagine if he had devoted his attention
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.840]   to trying to have a better legal system so that people could
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.680]   start small businesses, get bigger,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.560]   without having someone then come in on them for protection
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.240]   money.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.040]   Think where Russia would be now.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.080]   It would be dramatically better.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.000]   There's so much energy, so many raw resources.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.440]   Oh, and they have so many talented people.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.080]   But the Russians don't see it that way.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.560]   They see it in this continental view.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.960]   And they're the ones who have to come
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.080]   to terms with what they think.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.200]   In the meantime, this is why containment's brilliant,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.360]   is in the meantime, those of us who join the maritime order
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.840]   need to work with each other.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.240]   And then we contain the problem by saying,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.640]   you cannot join us on equal footing
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.680]   till you behave yourselves.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.000]   You get a time out, right?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.320]   If you get a time out from the global order,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.400]   but we would welcome you back in.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.000]   So you're talking about people doing territorial conquest,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.240]   right, and taking things.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.640]   You're butchering a lot of people.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.240]   You're destroying wealth at an incredibly rapid clip.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.480]   You can do that.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.920]   But it's really wealth destroying.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.400]   Since the Industrial Revolution in the West,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.680]   there has been a growing consensus
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.080]   that that's probably not the way to do things.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   We are far better crafting international institutions,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.320]   international laws, treaties that we sign onto,
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.280]   the parts that we want to, and then we adhere to them.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.480]   And then that allows us to go all over the world
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.440]   running our little credit card transactions.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.680]   No one kills us, and you can make a lot of wealth
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.600]   doing that.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   And that was the conclusion, that if you
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.080]   look at since the Industrial Revolution, who's
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.520]   making all the money?
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.160]   People who buy into that system.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.400]   And the Hitler territorial expansion is, in a way,
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.160]   it's a real throwback to a pre-Industrial Revolution,
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.320]   way of managing your national security.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.680]   This is how traditional continental empires always
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.480]   did it.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.960]   The Industrial Revolution with economic growth,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.280]   compounding economic growth, offers
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.840]   a completely different alternative,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.160]   which says we're going to do compounding wealth by having
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.760]   rules that we can all adhere to, and then we'll
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.240]   run our commercial transactions that way.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.520]   Institutions are really important.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.440]   Institutions structure decision making.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.520]   Now, it's very difficult to figure out what types
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.440]   of institutions to build.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.800]   And when you see failings in them,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.840]   you go, oh, I've got to do something next time.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.200]   But this, again, is the brilliance
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.680]   of this evolving maritime order in which we live,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.800]   where people sign on to the things in which it's
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.000]   in their interest to sign on to them.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.600]   You sign on to treaties, and then you
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.080]   have provisos of the parts you don't want.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.680]   And you join these international organizations,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.840]   and then you influence how they develop, et cetera.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.400]   So these organizations have been instrumental,
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.520]   the ones built right after World War II and holding the peace.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.920]   That's my biggest career takeaway,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.560]   is that if we go through international law
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.520]   and international institutions--
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.680]   and this is not a hege--
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.040]   political scientists love to talk about, ah,
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.000]   America, the hegemon, right?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.040]   No other country in the world wants an American hegemon.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.080]   There may be some people in the United States
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.280]   who thinks that looks great, but no one's
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.520]   going to buy into a world order in which the United States is
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.600]   the hegemon who pushes everyone else around.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.080]   I get it.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.000]   We're big, and we're influential.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.240]   Other people are influential, too.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.720]   But this maritime order, where, yeah,
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.800]   we're an important part of it, but have
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.840]   many other people in it, it's a win-win.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.040]   And you can look at some--
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.200]   with Biden right now, he's doing all of these meetings
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.280]   with Europeans of managing of what's
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.760]   going to go on in Ukraine, et cetera.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.200]   And it's based on agreement of all these different countries
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.600]   chipping in, big and small, those countries that
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.640]   are willing to cooperate with each other, not invade,
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.920]   negotiate their disagreements, work
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.760]   through international organizations,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.560]   improve international organizations.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.040]   That world is what you want to protect.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.000]   And you want to allow people to come and join.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.480]   So if Russia changes its mind, new government, et cetera,
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.280]   you want to bring them back into--
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.400]   just the way Japan and Germany were brought back in.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.960]   You want to protect that order forever.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.160]   Our prosperity is based on it.
